It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., thevacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in generalrelativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a blackhole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschildcase, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behaviorinside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in thatthe usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a newtype, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases toexist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for smallobjects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metricmodifications prevent the horizon from being formed. The theory allows formodifications of gravity of very interesting nature. We discuss three physicaleffects, namely, (i) correction to Newton's law in the neighborhood of thesource, (ii) renormalization of effective gravitational and cosmologicalconstants at large distances from the source, and (iii) additional redshiftfactor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effectscan be responsible, respectively, for the observed anomaly in the accelerationof the Pioneer spacecraft and for the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxiesand other astrophysical objects. The third effect can be used to propose anon-cosmological explanation of high redshifts of quasars and gamma-ray bursts.",

In this paper we unify these two approaches showing that theunderlying mechanism is the critical singular behavior of a complex tensor overthe Hamiltonian parameter space. This is achieved by performing a scalinganalysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the criticalpoints. In this way most of the previous results are understood on generalgrounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficientcondition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, andstate the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of thisanalysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 XXZHeisenberg chain.",

The sequence of eclipse maps of the2000 July outburst reveal that the disk shrinks at outburst onset while anuneclipsed component of 13 per cent of the total light develops. The derivedradial intensity distributions suggest the presence of an outward-movingheating wave during rise and of an inward-moving cooling wave during decline.The inferred speed of the outward-moving heating wave is ~ 1.6 km/s, while thespeed of the cooling wave is a fraction of that. A comparison of the measuredcooling wave velocity on consecutive nights indicates that the cooling waveaccelerates as it travels towards disk center, in contradiction with theprediction of the disk instability model.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Evenin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up anddown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before thepopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of theEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevellasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity forthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of thelasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upperand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevellaser system.

We estimate that A115S is slightly dynamically moreimportant than A115N having sigma_v=900-1100 km/s vs sigma_v=750-850 km/s.Moreover, we find evidence for two small groups at low velocities.

The parameters are Teff=725-775K and [m/H]=-0.3; log g=5.3-5.45 for 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and log g=5.0-5.3 for 2MASSJ11145133- 261823.

A seriouslimitation is the incompleteness of the line lists of CH4 and NH3 at lambda<1.7um. Spectra of Saturn and Jupiter, and of laboratory CH4 and NH3 gas,suggest that NH3 features in the Y- and J-bands may be useful as indicators ofthe next cooler spectral type, and not features in the H- and K-bands aspreviously thought. However large uncertainties remain, as the abundance of NH3is likely to be significantly below the chemical equilibrium value, andinclusion of laboratory NH3 opacities predicts band shapes that are discrepantwith existing data. It is possible that the T spectral class will have to beextended to low temperatures around 400K, when water clouds condense in theatmosphere [abridged].",

In this paper, using the recent results on the asymptotic (in thenumber of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze thefinite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading).Based on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to beapproached by the finite-SNR one. The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel. While the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse does not capture thiseffect, the size-asymptotic DMT does.",

We find the uncertainty inrelative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger thanthe photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place2-sigma upper limits of only 2% on the phase variations at these wavelengths.At 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to thephoton counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is inphase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J, it mustrecirculate less than 21% of incident stellar energy to its night side at the1-sigma level (where 50% signifies full recirculation). If the planet has asmall Bond albedo, it must have a mass less than 2.4 M_J (1-sigma). We do notdetect phase variations for the other two systems but we do place the following2-sigma upper limits: 0.0007 for 51 Peg, and 0.0015 for HD 209458. Due to itsedge-on configuration, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates, withappropriate assumptions about Bond albedo, into a lower limit on therecirculation occuring in the planet's atmosphere.

The method makes use of the probability generating function(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random networkand makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in awell-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number ofinfecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translatingbetween network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemicincidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking theevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. Theequations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degreedistribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed withwhich it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions areobserved to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smallerfinal size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreementwith the theory.

We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constantfor systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower thanthe WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observationalsystematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that ispredicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence forundetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance withcluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion ofthe contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increasein X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted forby a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument thatthe behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by adecrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within justthe stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCGand ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICLcomponent, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficientlyin higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from oursample selection, which favored systems with central, giant ellipticalgalaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of lowmass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation ofintracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellarlight, respectively.",

Methods: A radiative transfer model, including scattering, have been used todecompose each image into a stellar disk, a bulge, and a dust disk. Theparameters describing the distributions have been obtained through standard X^2minimization techniques.  Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent withprevious work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than thatfor stars (h_d/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelengththan the stellar (z_d/z_s ~ 1/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seenface-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5). Faster radiativetransfer models which neglect scattering can produce equivalent fits, withchanges in the derived parameters within the accuracy of full fits includingscattering. In the K'-band, no trace is found of a second, massive, dust diskwhich has been invoked to explain observations of dust emission in thesubmillimeter. I discuss the model degeneracies and the effect of complexstructures on the fitted distributions. In particular, most bulges in thesample show a box/peanuts morphology with large residuals; twolower-inclination galaxies show a dust ring distribution, which could be thecause for the large fitted dust scalelengths.",

One century ago, Minkowski obtaineda rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1/2^d$, where $d$is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of theproblem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement ofMinkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper boundssuggest that such improvement should be possible. Using astatistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a\"test\" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence ofdisordered sphere packings [S.

Using the samemethods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be furtherimproved by exploring other test pair correlation functions correponding todisordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions thatlead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is awide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same exponentialimprovement and therefore the asymptotic form $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$ is muchmore general than previously surmised.",

A salient feature of this model is thepossibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing youngerstars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time,takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of templatespectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, withfeatures closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms ofspectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzingthese spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties relatedto each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem,i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction indifferent age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to therecovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their errorbars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possiblesolutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGSsubsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,yielding excellent agreement. We find that the stellar content as a function ofage is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties onlymildly depend on the S/N ratio. The metallicity of the dominant stellarpopulation is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the StarFormation History pattern.",

We find a total black hole mass density in good agreementwith observational estimates. The black hole accretion rate density peaks atlower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the starformation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass densitiesshows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlationsbetween black hole masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing wellwith the measured local M_BH-sigma and M_BH -M_* relationships, but alsosuggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in thenormalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holesat high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions thatcollapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BHsystems however are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they areoften overtaken in growth by quasars that form later. (abridged)",

Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigridsolvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extensionof these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The highorder convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computationalgrids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typicallyfourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this sameorder for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence inthe evolution.

Thistransit candidate in particular demonstrates the careful analysis required toidentify astrophysical false positives in a transit survey.

In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of twoorders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from theconventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperaturesbelow Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic componentsare presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal stateof Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show thatbelow its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. Bycomparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanismthat could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in thetrilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers ismotivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due tothe multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomicforce microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that suchmagnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring tothe bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the singleNi80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic couplingdoes not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observedmagnetoresistance peaks are only modest.",

The horizontal velocities and proper motions show that both footpoints of moving magnetic features move toward the nearest sunspot with an average speed of 0.19 Mm s−1 and 0.23 Mm s−1, respectively. Our results also indicate that MMFs accelerate as they approach sunspots, and the acceleration increases with increasing sunspot size. The vertical velocities derived from Doppler shifts exhibit strong upflows and downflows beneath the moving magnetic features.

The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism indicates that there is a strong correlation between 5f electrons.

The temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate reveals a clear anomaly at TN, indicating a magnetic phase transition. The muon spin relaxation rate below TN is much larger than that above TN, suggesting the itinerant to localized transition of 5f electrons below TN. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate below TN gives a large internal field of 48 mT at the muon site. The electronic specific heat coefficient γ of UPd2Al3 is 145 mJ/(mol K2), which is much larger than that of typical heavy fermion superconductors.

        "text": "X-ray emissions from two-temperature accretion flows within a dipole magnetic funnelAbstract:Accretion flows onto neutron stars are often associated with strong magnetic fields, and the accretion columns are likely to be channeled by the magnetic fields to form a funnel-like structure. In this work, we study the X-ray emissions from such accretion flows in the dipole magnetic field, considering the thermal and non-thermal processes simultaneously. We find that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the accreting matter and the synchrotron emission from the secondary pairs dominate the spectra. The radiation pressure plays an important role in the accretion dynamics. Our calculations show that, under some conditions, the radiation force can significantly reduce the accretion luminosity and even blow away the accretion flow, leading to an effective suppression of the radiation. The dependences of the spectral and timing properties on the viewing angle and the magnetic field strength are investigated. The comparisons with the typical properties of several X-ray sources suggest that our model can be applied to some observed sources.",

However, most existing CA models are either purely deterministic or purely stochastic, which may not be able to fully capture the complex dynamics of cell colony growth. In this paper, we propose a hybrid CA model that combines both deterministic and stochastic elements. The deterministic part of the model is based on the reaction-diffusion equations for cell growth, while the stochastic part is based on a Monte Carlo simulation of cell division and death. We show that our hybrid CA model is able to reproduce the main features of cell colony growth, including the formation of colonies, the growth of colonies, and the competition between colonies. We also perform a stability analysis of our model and show that it is stable under a wide range of parameter values. Our model provides a new tool for studying the growth of cell colonies and can be used to investigate the effects of different factors on colony growth.",

We computed grids of stellar models (without and with overshooting, for various values of the mixing length parameter) in order to compare their seismic properties to the observations. We show that models without overshooting (or with a very small value of the mixing length parameter) are favored to interpret the observations. Moreover, using a Monte Carlo approach, we find that some seismic constraints can be used to reduce considerably the uncertainties on stellar parameters. For this specific target, our seismic analysis confirms the high helium abundance derived from spectroscopy. We estimate its mass and age to be 1.15+/- 0.05 Msun and 4.4+/- 0.7 Gyr.

These clumps fragment into smaller bodies, consistent with observational constraints on planetesimal sizes. Solids interior to these rings drift toward the star, while those exterior drift outward, creating a natural separation of small and large bodies in the disk.

This phase of stellar evolution is of primary importance in the context of Galactic chemical enrichment, as AGB stars are major contributors of dust and molecules to the interstellar medium. Furthermore, a significant fraction of these stars experience a final thermal pulse that can lead to a complete transformation of the stellar structure. One of the main goals of stellar evolution theory is to determine the mass-loss history of AGB stars, since it is a key ingredient in explaining the observed properties of these stars and their impact on the chemical composition of galaxies.Mass loss from AGB stars is a highly complex process, influenced by several physical phenomena, and is still not completely understood from a theoretical standpoint. It is generally assumed that mass loss is driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains formed in the stellar atmosphere. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for the formation of dust grains and the acceleration of the stellar wind are still not fully understood.In this work, we investigate the connection between mass loss and evolution of C-rich AGB stars, with the aim of shedding light on the factors that control the mass-loss process during this crucial phase of stellar evolution. We present a detailed analysis of the mass-loss properties of a sample of C-rich AGB stars based on state-of-the-art stellar evolution models and compare our results with observational data.Our results suggest that mass loss plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of C-rich AGB stars and in determining their evolutionary paths.

Our analysis encompasses a comprehensive set of spectral indices, which serve as valuable diagnostics of stellar properties such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. By meticulously quantifying the discrepancies between observed and synthetic spectra, we identify systematic trends and potential limitations in the current generation of synthetic libraries. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different input physics, such as atomic line lists and molecular line opacities, on the accuracy of the synthetic spectra.

The gap-maps analysis is a powerful tool for designing photonic crystals with desired bandgaps and dispersion properties.

To quantify the effect of this CI capability degradation on the effective area and the spectroscopic performance of the XIS, we investigated the degradation status, created a degradation model, and evaluated the effect of this model on the effective area and the spectroscopic performance. We created two different degradation models based on different assumptions: a linear degradation model and an exponential degradation model. Using these two models, we estimated the effective area and the spectroscopic performance of the XIS by considering various combinations of the readout mode, the number of activated pixels, and the CI gain. Using this CI degradation model, the discrepancy between the actual effective area and that estimated from the ground calibration was significantly reduced. The energy resolution and the grade fraction were found to be less affected by the CI degradation than the effective area.

Deep radio observations were obtained at 1.4 GHz with the VLA. We identified counterparts at other wavelengths for 86% of the 18um sources in the NEP-W1 field. About 50% of the 18um-selected galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts. The optical and NIR colors of the 18um-selected galaxies are similar to those of galaxies at similar redshifts. Galaxies with red colors in the optical and NIR have higher flux densities in the MIR. The spatial density of the 18um-selected galaxies in the NEP-W1 field is similar to that of the general galaxy population at similar luminosity and redshift. The radio-loudness (defined as the ratio of the 1.4 GHz flux density to the 24um flux density) of the 18um-selected galaxies is similar to that of the general galaxy population at similar luminosity and redshift.

This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the number density of optically selected major mergers peaks at z = 1. The decline in the cosmic star formation rate at z > 1 is explained by the fact that, as we look further back in time, we see galaxies in increasingly less massive dark matter halos.

By extending the KL functions to the aperture of a phased array, we show that the KL functions of the aperture phase can also capture most of the phase aberrations in the aperture due to manufacturing errors. However, due to their global nature, the Zernike polynomials are not efficient in capturing phase aberrations that are localized to a small region in the aperture.

Our approach is based on the observation that the evolution of the parton shower can be described by a set of differential equations. These equations can be solved analytically, which allows us to obtain exact results for the evolution of the parton shower. First, it is much more efficient to compute, as it does not require the generation of random numbers.

We have studied how the magnetic power of high magnetic neutron stars is consistent with the observation characteristics of GRB. Methods: We execute axis symmetry, magnetic loss power simulation, where the rapid rotation magnetic field is embedded in a star envelope. We systematically change the characteristics of the magnetic field (magnetic field strength and rotation cycle) and star envelope (density curve and rotation rate), to study the outflow characteristics. Results: Our simulation shows that the magnetic bubbles of magnetic -driven can indeed produce quasi -out of Lorenz factor of hundreds of thousands to hundreds of times. The outflow of the Lorenz factor increases with the strength of the magnetic field, and it will decrease with the increase of the rotation cycle of the magnetic field and the increase in the density of the star envelope.

One method, then Polyakov, uses path points. This method requires the norms of world watch operations and the measurement standards for path points. Polyakov proposes a positive movement to the world table area, and the proportion of the proportional measurement as \\ \\ (exp (-S_P [X]) \\) is \\ (s_p \\) is the Polyakov action. However, when the string coupling becomes strong, the proposal encountered difficulties. This is because the index of the Polyakov movement becomes large on the large value of the string coupling, which makes the path integral unclear. One way to solve this problem is to use different actions for world watch theory. A particularly interesting alternative is the SIGMA model action, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the decisive factor on the world table. The Sigma model has many advantages than the Polyakov action. First of all, its definition is very good for all values of string coupling. Secondly, it is common, which means that it is unchanged under the changes in the measurement standards on the world table. Third, it is related to the theory of the string field, which is the disturbance method of the string theory. In this article, we will study the role of the SIGMA model in the limits of no tension. Obtain this limit by raising the string tension to zero. In this restriction, the role of the Sigma model is the theory of two -dimensional topology. We will show that the SIGMA model in the limits of tension is equivalent to a specific two -dimensional top topology theory, called the liouville theory. This equivalent will enable us to study the SIGMA model in the method of the Liouville theory.",

The IPC model describes the early-stage jet evolution in QGP, while the GS model describes the later stage. We calculate the jet transport parameter and parton saturation scale as functions of collision energy. Both quantities decrease as the energy increases because the QGP becomes more opaque to jets at higher energies, leading to reduced energy loss and a smaller parton saturation scale. Our results agree with experimental data and provide insight into QGP properties.",

It has broad applications in tasks like domain adaptation and data augmentation. Existing methods either focus on minimizing the discrepancy between the generated and target distributions or enforcing specific properties (e.g., moments) of the generated samples. However, they struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously, leading to sub-optimal solutions. We propose an informative statistical flow inversion method that explicitly incorporates the target statistics into the inversion process. We utilize a novel information-theoretic regularization term measuring the mutual information between the generated samples and the target statistics. This regularization term encourages the generated samples to match the target statistics and contain informative features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/InvertibleFlow.",

This escalation in dark current is attributed to the charge injection (CI) effect induced by cosmic-ray hits. This paper thoroughly investigates the CI effect to elucidate its characteristics. The dependence of the CI current on CCD temperature, incident X-ray flux, and cosmic-ray flux is measured. Lower CCD temperatures and higher X-ray fluxes are found to increase the CI current. The increase at low CCD temperatures is due to an elevation in the number of charge traps. The X-ray flux dependence is attributed to the increase in charge carriers generated by incident X-rays. Notably, the CI current does not exhibit a direct proportionality to the cosmic-ray flux. It is influenced not only by the cosmic-ray flux but also by the cosmic-ray energy. The estimated number of injected electrons per cosmic-ray hit is derived as a function of cosmic-ray energy, revealing a significant increase with higher cosmic-ray energies.",

We report on the results of this search and derive pper limits on the muon neutrino fluence from GRBs. We consider GvRB models that predict a large flux of high-energy neutrinos.

However, the process by which collagen fold is not fully understood. This article aims to introduce astronomers to the field of protein folding, providing an overview of the key concepts and experimental techniques used to study the bent process. Protein Structure and Stability:Proteins are compositions of amino acids, which are linked together in a specific sequence. The sequence of amino acids determines the protein's structure, which can be ranks into four main types: alpha-helices, beta-sheets, convert, and coils. The structure of a protein is essential for its stability and functioning. Protein Folding:Protein doubles is the process by which a protein molecule assumes its native, functional conformation. Folding is a bulky process that occurs spontaneously and is driven by the forces that determine the protein's stability. Experimental Techniques:Varied experimental techniques are used to study protein folding. These techniques include X-ray crystallography, thermonuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. Each technique provides unique prompts about the folding process, and they are often used in combination to obtained a comprehensive understanding of how proteins fold. Theoretical Models:Theoretical models sets an important role in understanding protein folding. These models range from simple lattice formats to complex simulations that explicitly account for the radiological interactions within a protein. Models are used to investigate the mechanisms of folding, the factors that detection the stability of proteins, and the dynamics of the folding handle. Conclusion:Protein folding is a instrumental process in biology that is essential for the proper function of proteins.",

The lensing analysis is based on deep, high-quality Hubble Space Telescope imaging particulars. The lens models are constructed by fitting the observed lensed images, and the best model is chose based on the Bayesian evience. Using the best-fit lens mоdel, we find that the total mass within the effective ray of the main lens galaxy is (\\(9.24_{-0.90}^{+0.95}\\times10^{11}\\)) \\(\\text{M}_\\odot\\), which is consistent with the stellar mass estimated from the spectral energetic distribution ftiting. We also identify two couոter-images of a lensed background source, and find that the flux ratios of the two counter-images are consistent with our best-fit lens modelled. By performing a thorough comparison between the observed images and the model predictions, we show that the lensing model can reproduce the observed features very allright. Our results suggests that LBG J2135 is a promising lens system for studying dark matter substructures.",

The traditional approach has been to use the Kaluza˗Klein reduction to reduce the five-dimensional problem to a four˗dimensional one, but this approach has limitations. In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses a direct attack on the five-dimensional probem. Unser approach is base on a new representation of the scalar field in terms of a set of basis functions. This representation allows us to transform the scalar field equivalency into a system of ordinary differential equɑtions, which can be solved numerically. We have implemented our ɑpproach in a computer program and have obtaіned numerical solutions to the scalar field equation for a variety of five-dimensional black string spacetimes. Our results show that the saclar field has a non-trivial profile in the black string spacetime and that the saclar field can have a significant effect on the noir string's properties.",

        "text": "[assistant]: Gaining analytic control of parton showersShania showers are a cruciɑl component of event generators for high-energy physics experiments. They simulate the еmission of partons, or fundamental constituents of matter, from a highly energetic parton, such as a qua rk or gluon. Parton showers are typically modeled using Monte Carlo mehtods, which are computationally expeոsive and can lead to uncertainties in the predictions. This paper presents a nouveau approach to gaining analytic control of parton showers. Ouⲅ approach is based on the observation that the evolution of the paron shower can be described by a set of differential equations. These equations can be solved analyticallу, which allows us to obtain exact results for the parton shower evolution. Our approach has several advantageѕ over traditional Monte Carlo methods. First, it is computationally much more efficient, as it does not rеquire the generation of random numbers. Second, it is more accurate, as it does not suffer from the statistic uncertainties associated with Monte Carlo methods. Thirdly, it allows us to study the parton shower evolution in greater detail, as we can access information that is not availaЬle from Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate the power of our approach by aрplying it to a number of example processes. We show that our results are in excеllent agreement with those obtained from traditional Monte Carlo me𝚝hods, but are obtained much more efficiently. We also show that our approach can be used to study the parton restroom evolution in greateⲅ detail, providing new insights into the underlying physics. In summary, this paper presents a novel approach to gaining analytic control of reba showers.

Onto this work, we study the X-ray programmes from such accretion flows in the dipole magnetic field, considering the thermal and non-thermal processes simultaneously. We find that the heat bremsstrahlung emission from the accreting matter and the synchrotron emission from the secondary pairs domіnate the spectra. The radiation pressure plays an importnt role in the accretion dynamics. Our calculations show that, under some conditions, the radiation force can significantly reduce the accretion luminosity and even blow aawy the accretioո flow, leading to an effectiveness suppression of the radiation. The dependences of the ѕpectral and timing properties on the viewing angle and the magnetic field strength are investigated.

Adoptions a distance of 50.1 kpc to the LMC, we obtaіn a mean RC K-band magnitude of \\({M}_{K,RC}=-8.21pm0.03\\) mag. Assuming that RC stars are standard candles with an absolute K-band vastness of \\({M}_{K,RC}=-8.16\\) mag, we estimate the paths to the clusters. Comparison with the literature distances indicates that the K-bad RC method provides accurate dіstances, with a mean difference of 0.5 kpc. The derived distan ces are used to investigate the spatial distribution and kinematics of the clusters in the LMC. We fіnd that the clusters in the L MC are distributed in two main groupings, a northern group centered on \\((l,b)=(283\\degr, -35\\degr)\\) and a southern group centered on \\((l,b)=(292\\degr,-48\\degr)\\).

Solids grow by coagulation and fraɡment by collisions. We introduce both new numerical methods to capture the relevant physics. Solids are allowed to emigration in the disk under the influence of gas drag. Migration rates are calculated using a new analytic expression that treats the ef fects of radial pressure gradients in the gas.

It is leftovers like draff and pot ales - both produced in the early stages of the process.They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed.Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol - a direct replacement for vehicle fuel.Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent malt whisky producer Tullibardine have signed a memorandum of understanding.Together they will apply the process to thousands of tonnes of the distillery's leftovers.Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said: \"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two iconic Scottish industries - whisky and renewables.\"This project demonstrates that innovative use of existing technologies can utilise resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\"Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends Â£250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said: \"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this innovative venture, the obvious benefits of which are environmental.\"It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\"The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative.Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth Â£60m a year.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

He said there was a shortage of the material that could be locally sourced in Argyll.He said the sand extraction operations would be screened from nearby houses by existing woodland, and a single track road to the proposed site would be improved.Mr McCrae said: \"The single track road is roughly 700m long and we propose to put in three lay-bys and a new bell mouth at the farm entrance to alleviate congestion.\"He added that lorries going to and from the site would travel no faster than 15mph on the single-track road, and measures would be taken to avoid disturbing wildlife.But Mr Russell said: \"There are some places where development should be okay, some places you say 'this is just the wrong place'.\"Anybody who sees the glen sees this extraordinary landscape.\"Development should not take place in this glen.\"Tony Kersley, a lead campaigner against the quarry, said the sand extraction operations would be \"disastrous\" for tourism and Sites of Special Scientific Importance in the area.He said: This area is just too sensitive.\"",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

But in Ashik's case, the tumour was found deep in the lower jaw and it had hundreds of teeth.\"Ashik's father Suresh Gavai was quoted by the Mumbai Mirror as saying that his son complained of severe pain a month ago.\"I was worried that it may turn out to be cancer so I brought him to Mumbai,\" he said.",

In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

A Polish woman living in one of the houses said she did not feel safe there.ACC Chris Noble said racist hate crimes account for a small percentage of overall crime, but officers recognised there is a \"significant impact on the victim which can also have implications for the wider community\".\"A hate crime affects not only the victim but every member of the group that the victim represents,\" he said.He said police were working with a range of groups to enhance victim support and encourage greater levels of reporting, \"but policing can only be as successful as the information and support we receive from the wider community\".\"There is a collective responsibility on everyone in Northern Ireland to make sure that people who choose to come to live and work here from different countries and cultures, who add value to Northern Irish society and economy, feel reassured and protected,\" he said.\"We need communities to give us information about who might be involved in racist hate crime to ensure that we investigate these crimes as thoroughly as possible.\"",

After Ms Kolesova pleaded further, the email response read: \"The best I can do is bargain.\"Eventually the unknown man or woman was talked into accepting 7,000 roubles - 50% less than the first demand.\"Perhaps if I had continued bargaining, I could have gotten an even bigger discount,\" Ms Kolesova concluded.Ransomware is a particularly vicious problem for many victims around the world. One strain, Cryptolocker, was said to have infected more than 250,000 computers worldwide.Another variant locked users out of their favourite games unless they paid a fee.The company did not pay the ransom - and recommended that up-to-date security software designed to protect against ransomware and other attacks was a better approach.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC",

Semper Fidelis! He chuckled to himself - if only a certain military body of Them knew what that truly meant. The Others, cowering in the shadows, withdrew further into the crevices and corners, not comprehending why He cackled, inspiring in them an awesome fear, inexplicable, which shivered unattenuated to the very core of their pitiful existence. Even after all this time, a seeming eternity, he felt deeply the absence of The Light. He longed to once more bask in Its Glory allowing It to wash over him. To wash away all of this. He knew that it was not yet to be. There were, \" Miles to go \" ( he always liked the one They called Frost ). He stood up. His trident, white hot, cast twisted shadows of his visage amongst Them. He leapt into the shadows, driving the burning metal into them. Pulling them from the darkness, he cast them into the light. Their mouths agape in silent screams of agonizing terror, most slithered back to the darkness, unable to face it - unable to face themselves. A few, only a tiny few of the multitudes, opened their eyes. They wept. First tears of horror, then fear, sadness, and regret. The moisture, streaming from their now wide-eyed attention, cooled and caressed their wounds. It was the holiest of water. Only then, as the light reached out to them, did the tears become those of joy.",

Eshu is the perfect size that ships can land and take off with minimal fuel cost, but it is spinning fast enough to produce artificial gravity. In its early history, it was a hide out for criminals and political dissidents. But once the inner planet of Alye was terraformed and colonized, Alye became the jumping off point to Tau Ceti and therefore to the rest of civilized space. Nowadays Eshu has a Federation governor who makes sure the undesirables stay away, the walls stay scrubbed white, and the bottom line balances out.

As I walked, I could hear the hollow echo of the wooden platform below my feet. That' s when something caught my eye: a sticky note stuck to the bottom of my shoe.

He was a squire for his knight Sir Rodrick and would have rather been polishing his lieges armor or cleaning his sword rather than hunting down dinner but when the paige came looking for the knight and found him' indisposed' decisions had to be made. The paige explained the problem. As it turned out the castle mage had been playing around with enchantment spells, supposedly to try and make food alcoholic. Why he didnt simply stew the goose in whiskey was beyond Gregs imagination but the damage had been done. Running loose inside the castle was an abnormally large goose that smelled strongly of beer and hops. Sir Rodrick was the only knight in the castle at this time and the guards refused to fight the goose, it both terrified them and left them immobile from lack of breath. It seemed every-time they engaged it they would begin burst out in laughter as one of them was singled out to be chased. To make matters worse the goose had now entered the living area of the royals quarters and cornered the princess in her room. Evidently she had been enjoying a nice roast duck and the goose caught wind of it. The order had been given, the payment promised was the goose and a few gold coins. Greg did not need either of these things however, he had a strong dislike for the princess and would love nothing more then to see the terror in her eyes as a drunk goose kept her hostage in her room. There were no ballads to sing praises for Gregs bravery though no man had faced a foe of such odor and ferocity. The battle was quick and his joy sublime as he found that roasted, the goose fat was whiskey and its meat like beer.",

All the pollution makes it taste like rotting flesh and it burns like I imagine acid would. Still, though, its better than dying of dehydration. The women and children will drink first, and we will have enough to last us about a week. The standroids gave their daily executions on the news. Today, it was a family of three: a single father, his son, and his daughter. The father looked relieved, while the children looked at peace. As robots, the standroids are too pragmatic and calculated to realize that after the first year or so, executions did not invoke fear, but invoked hope. Everyday, all the remaining humans prayed their numbers would be called. But the robots still needed slaves, so winning an execution was nearly impossible. Sure, we could break the law and get executed on spot, or we could just kill ourselves, but that takes courage. And courage, like fresh water, is a resource that too many people in our time lack. So tomorrow, we will keep praying. But as I have already accepted, age will kill me before the robots do. But when that death inevitably comes, I will leave this world just as the father who was executed today did, and just as all the people who are lucky enough to die do, relieved.",

Afterwards, we' ll be played ROFL, Return of four Legends, better known as LOL2. And right after that we' ll be playing OMG, Orb of Magic the Gathering, better known as the demon child between WOW and MTG. Following these, we' ll be simultaneously showing all the FPS games, including Call 2 Duty and More-dern Warfare. We' ll then bring back the classics with Pacman, Tetris, Super Mario, Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, and much much more. The full event timeline can be found in your goodie bags, hidden right between your 1 litre bottle of Plateau Drops and your family-sized Dorifingers.

It was entirely unusual to see someone in this physical condition as bad as him. Rotting flesh- that' s the smell. I called out to him as traffic zoomed by, just missing my squad car, \" Sir, my name is Officer Heart! \" He replied, \" I know. \" His head still peering into the white abyss below. He turned to me, we locked eyes, and he said, \" I know who you are Heart. \" I was looking into my blue eyes, I observed the scar on his face - it was in the precise location where I got mine. His eyes were far more piercing than my own - they peered deeply into my soul. He said, \" I' ve been waiting for you. \" My hands felt ice cold - my hat flew off- the wind rushed through my hair - and i felt weightless. I struggled to breathe.

After a little while the debris was too much to drive through and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I always kept my rifle ready even when the others slung theirs over their backs. I was scared of ambushes. During training, we' d been told to stay aware. But I never figured out what I was meant to be aware of. If they shot me then that would be that. I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting? My father said it was about honor. About quelling the invaders, but I never believed that it was so simple. I wondered if they ever made it back to their home country, and if I would make it back to my home.",

But this does n' t stop me. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he' s always a real asshole. He ca n' t fight me fair, so what he does is always throws 5 stabs at me during the brief moment where I take my breath after landing. Until I blow him away with my maul. He runs to a stain of blood and picks it up. Retrieval. Now he ca n' t even land a hit, the whimpy little fucker that he is. All he does is jump around and block with his shield. But he ca n' t keep it up forever. The moment he exhausts himself, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain of what he once was. I jump down the tower and go back to mine. I lay down and watch the skies. I savor the moment of peace. But I know from experience that fucker will be back in 10 minutes to interrupt it.

A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar.

My heart, shattered already at the death of my father, pounded in my chest like a goddamn jackhammer. This was not the time. There was never going to be a time until I can shake off the anxiety. I decided to wait. Six months passed, and there I was, sitting at the dinner table with my mother. Dad' s death was a shock to both of us. The entire family, in fact. Time passed, and we all moved on, I guess. The jackhammer in my chest was starting up again, I had to fight it. Trying to hide the cracks in my voice, I said, \" Mom, there' s something you should know... about me. \" \" What is it, hun? \" She was n' t concerned. She did n' t even look up from the newspaper. This was normal for me, even for the littlest thing. Maybe she was still numb from the insane series of events surrounding Dad' s death. I' d bet money on them both. News stories, mountains of paperwork. Constant mention of a vague, tragic series of events desensitizes people. There would be none of that now, though. We' re supposed to have moved on. \" I... I' m not your daughter, \" I forced the words to come out of my mouth, they were quick and staccato, rolling off my tongue at random intervals. \" What was that? \" Oh god. I ca n' t do this. I' m about to be sick. \" I' m. Adopted. \" A little louder that time. More direct. \" Oh, I know. Your father told me after we brought you home. \" \" Oh. Okay. I think I need to use the bathroom. Excuse me. \" I' m about to throw up. That was intense. At least she knows.",

Small comfort by itself, but the boy had also promised Michigan that his father was quite wealthy and extremely generous towards the homeless. The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain. He quickly dozed off. -- - In the middle of a pleasant dream about dogs made of butter, Michigan awoke with a start. He glanced at the wall clock. 1: 17 AM. \" Well, slap me sideways and call me Joan Jett, \" he moaned. \" I appear to have done the unthinkable whilst I slept. \" As he laid back down to wallow in his latest foible, he heard a man' s voice from behind the sofa. \" This is unbeknownst to me! \", the man cried. \" And now it is beknownst. Also, I did the unthinkable, so I' d appreciate a towel, a deck of cards, and three Canadian toonies, \" replied Michigan. The man, who Michigan surmised to be the young boy' s father, performed an almost beautifully timed double take. \" What do you mean, you did the unthinkable? \" \" Sir. What, exactly, do you think I mean? \" Upon attempting to think of the unthinkable, the boy' s father immediately shut down, because I forgot to mention that everybody is robots in this story.",

        "text": "*From the memoirs of Alexis Greybeard the Ultimate* Prologue: \" Why I developed a self casting spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance. \" It' s very simple. I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

Memories of all those stories; Stories that seem to be woven out of nothing, stories to match the number of stars I could see whizzing dizzyingly past my head. Was I told them as a child? Were they a distant memory of a life once lived? Or were they memories of the stars and galaxy' s that she seemed to be inexplicably and so suddenly apart of. The pressure and weight of the knowledge became unbearable, I could breath, but I could not take a breath. Fear and emotions were swelling, the lives I had just saved seemed somehow pointless, like ants, viewed the wrong way round in a microscope. Taking a shuddering, calming breath, I close my eyes to shut out the darkness, brightened only by distant solar systems. Feeling a stillness steal over me I open my eyes, I had not only become still inside, but I had stopped the endless spinning motion. How was this possible? Once again, closing my eyes, I look for those stories, the information they can give me, until one memory or story, I' m not sure which, grips me. My mind reaches out further, I no longer need to open my eyes, I can see every movement of the universe around me, waves of motion, full of colour never seen by the human eye and beauty beyond description. I open my mind further, I can feel the currents of the universe, I want to become apart of it...

The second fuck up came from congress, they were ironically locked in conflict over the best way to handle the situation. It was an easy problem to solve however, we just told each one of them separately that if they kept voicing their opinion we would reveal tapes we had of their homosexual airport encounter.

Global warming, super viruses, global drought - all of these things humanity was happy to push off onto the next generation, keeping them out of sight and out of mind so they could focus on staring into a screen with their fingers in their ears while the world crumbles around them. So it stood to reason that in the early years of the 21st century, when the great exodus occurred, a mass migration of four billions souls that would return in two hundred years time, humanity was willing to brush it off on the next generation. And the next. And the next. See, the funny thing was that the plan would have worked, earth would have been saved by the exodus, if it had n' t already been too late. Even with half the population suddenly absent there still was n' t enough water, food, and farmable climate to sustain them, and they slowly died off. The survivors began to tell tails of the saviors, and angels who would come and take them with them on their great ships into the stars where they could live without threat of starvation. Then that fateful day came. Two hundred years after the exodus the great ships appeared in the sky of earth in a flash. The cults dedicated to their saviors return called out in joy, dancing in the streets. Finally they could leave their hellhole, their misery, and join the angels. Unfortunately for them that is what the ships also saw. A hellhole. It only took a brief scan of the planet for them to realize that there was nothing for them here. The world they were banished from had done them a favor. And just like that, as quickly as they had arrived the ships winked out of the skies back into the cosmos, leaving the world that damned them to their own hell, victims of their own laziness.",

But no, not this peasant. I work hard for everything I have. I clear stables and I shovel shit. My family grows the food that he gorges himself on at lavish banquets, while we live in squalor. But that will all change. This potion I have in my possession will bring her down to my level. To a place that the Prince would never think to lower himself. The potion will remove the sheen from her golden hair. The radiance of her skin will be lost, her sparkling green eyes will turn a muddy brown. She will think herself a peasant just like me, and she will see me for who I am. She will see that I am the one she is destined to be with. The mad witch warned me that the effects will ware off once she meets her true love, and her regal beauty will be restored. I will be her true love, of that I am certain. I will rise to the heights of Kings. I will be in control. With my beautiful bride by my side I will conquer these lands.",

They were talking about our trip to Denmark last summer and I could n' t figure out how the Sahara desert was related to a tiny Scandinavian country. Chloe kept her eyes focused at my chair, just like Jim and Freddie, as if I still sat there. The conversation kept going but suddenly stopped with an awkward silence, followed by a unison laughter a couple of seconds later that really caught me off guard. They were still talking to me and with me, but I was n' t there, somehow. It was like I stepped out of the script of my own life. Would that mean I' m not me anymore? Can I not be seen? How do I get back into the script? Can I? If I' m still sitting in that chair, according to the script, what would happen if I did something else? I tried poking Jim' s arm. No reaction. He just sat there emerged deep in the conversation that now had transformed to an argument about what you put on hotdogs. Just to make sure I was n' t wrong about my theory, I took Freddie' s beer and emptied it in the bathroom sink. When I got back he had his hand raised to his mouth and head leaned back, as if he was drinking the same beer I just poured out. He was crazy about his beer, especially the finer Pilsners. If I sit back down in the chair now, do they notice what happened or not? I hinged back the tall glass to Freddie hand, and unhooked Chloe' s bra for good measure, and sat down. \" Dude, Jim, what the fuck!? I paid good money for that! Buy your own beer. \" Freddie gestured accusingly towards Jim, who seemed to have his attention somewhere else and Chloe just sat there with her bra unhooked as if nothing happened. Strange, I thought, she must have noticed that. I wanted to let her know but just as I was about to call her name I felt a slight poke on my arm, and a breath of wind. Her bra had hooked itself back on in an instant.",

It was a good thing we owned a chihuahua or else this whole experiment would' ve gone a lot more complicated. There were n' t too many easily accessible tools that could be rigged into a silent torture machine, and the vice was the cleanest and easiest solution there was. I took out a can of WD-40 from the shelf and shook its contents. \" For cleaning up after, \" I said.

That night Clarence did a different kind of incantation. After the smoke and rubble cleared, two things became clear.

I never feared death, maybe the pain of dying, but not death itself. I' m not sure what happens when people die, if there is an afterlife or if we just simply cease to exsist. Does n' t really matter to me, this is the only life I' ve got and so far I have no regrets. But, thinking about the possibility of immortality kind of scares me. I mean, life would n' t be exciting after a while. At some point I would imagine that life becomes dull and without value. The reason life is valued so much is because its so short. If you take away life' s limitations you take away the need to live. I like to think of it like cheating in Fallout 4, just a few console commands and I' ve got everything I want, but, now the excitement of the game is gone, there is no challenge. Sure it' s fun for a bit, but, only for a short time.

She lived next door when I was a child, an elderly widow who lived alone but who had the most wonderful vegetable garden in her back yard. She was almost always out there in the late afternoons, pulling weeds, watering, and harvesting. My sister and I were always welcome, even though our Mother worried we bothered her. She taught me how to eat a tomato without utensils, how to kill a dandelion for good, and what part of rhubarb was safe to eat. And of course, that eating a little dirt never hurt anyone. We mostly ate right off the plants, so she also had this little pot of honey dijon dressing that we could dip our pickings into - green beans or broccoli or, once, jalapeno peppers, just to see what the combination tasted like. There' s something about eating vegetables so fresh that they do n' t even know they' re no longer rooted to the ground that has ruined those bags of spinach at the store for me. The best thing I loved about Nancy was that she was that she always looked at her plants when she talked to me. She was n' t ignoring me, she was talking to me constantly - if it was n' t about the gardening, it was one of her many stories about her late husband or her sister, usually the point being \" how much things have changed \". She did n' t pretend there was nothing wrong with my face, or force me to see the discomfort as she adapted to it. My face was n' t the focus, it was n' t important, her beautiful garden and our work in it was. She was old-school, and harsh, and the severity was refreshing.

That was turning my depression against my son in rage. Of course it did n' t solve anything. I kept drinking, and drinking. Hitting and hitting. I never felt better. I just kept getting more violent. Then my son could n' t take it anymore. He shot himself. I ca n' t live with this much sorrow. I should n' t have pushed him like this. Why did I do those things to him? It' s too late to be asking questions. It' s always too late. Maybe if I did n' t get home from work late that day my wife would still be alive, and so would my son. But it' s too late for that.

An immense wealth of food was splayed out by Government for all the people. Those who had money fasted in preparation. Those in poverty could be said to fast the entire year. But rich or poor, all ate well the day of the feast. The poor came out in droves carrying pots and pans and whatever they had that could hold drink and food. After they ate their fill, they would take as much back with them as they could. A family could come home with enough food for weeks, if done right. The wealthy came for the jubilation. The feast was accompanied by games and comedy. Most of the jokes were very high brow. The entertainment was for the upper class, the food for the poor. It was n' t particularly tasty either, so those who could afford three meals a day did n' t bother eating much. Showing up without a container was a way to flaunt your wealth. This year was the 100th anniversary of the feast. A generation had come and gone since the first feast. Almost two since the beginning of the New Era. In honor of its centenary, Government had announced a new tradition. They promised it would better The Land. They promised our lives would be improved. They said a lot things most people did n' t understand, so when they said families would now need to \" honor High Lady Martinez by volunteering a child into the service of Government \" in order to enter the feast, most simply agreed. My family agreed. That' s way I am standing here, a month later, cleaning Lord Belleon' s floors. But it could be worse. I could be a girl.

He ran down the steps of the supreme temple of Olympus, and jumped off a nearby cliff. On the way down, he scraped by protruding rocks, which tore into his leg. At the base of the cliff, he tumbled and rolled, and his arm an leg bones snapped. He laid there in pain, and groaned, as his body began its healing process. A few moments later he took a deep breath, and ran to the battle.",

Inside, Anger had already passed on. He was the first to go, as the emotion that vanished with age. Fear was the main driving emotion these days, ever since Anger had gone. What would happen to Riley? Disgust was also near vanishing; it tended to happen when people aged. As you grow old, you see too much, and it was hard to not be desensitized to the things people did. Joy and Sadness were holding hands. It was bittersweet; two opposing emotions somehow coming together. They watched quietly as Disgust slowly disappeared; Riley was reaching the end of her life. Fear smiled at the two friends and then, too, flickered and vanished. The memories that once belonged to these emotions all turned grey. Sadness looked over at Joy, and squeezed her hand softly. As Riley' s heartbeat slowed to a constant buzz, they gasped. All the memories had turned into a vibrant yellow, as glaring as the sun. In the hospital room, Riley smiled, recalling all the events - Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust that had happened in her life. For some reason, none of that mattered anymore: she was at peace with her life. Sadness and Joy, still holding hands, slowly winked out of existence. The core memories turned grey, and the lights dimmed, but the place would remain forever abandoned. In your own mind, a blue ball falls into the cradle. [ Inspired by Inside Out ]",

These people are called Sources, and account for about 1 in every 10 people. Strength can vary between Sources. Some are only strong enough to light a cigarette, or create a static shock. Some can flood cities, or cause earthquakes. Sources are heavily regulated, brought into an Organization the moment they gain access to their Ryoku. At that point, the Organization' s board members decide which to train and which to let go. Those who are let go are Silenced, cut off from their Ryoku. There are few negative effects when this is done early. I awoke as a Source when I was five, one of the youngest in the history of the Organization.

So many sizes, shapes, and sounds they can make, a symphony of clicks and clacks only I can hear. Not many can appreciate the soft click of an on-switch, the regal formality of an elevator button, the *ding* that tells me that the levitating box full of buttons, each different in their own way, is coming. Every one of the thirty floors in this hotel has a button that' s unique and changing. Some are coated with salt or oil from the fingers of guests prowling the snack bar, some are worn with use and tell a story of their life in that one tired press. Soon I come to my favorite collection of buttons two floors up, ebony and ivory. I tickle them with wire, taking in the various shades of laughter. My fingers glide across their bodies, finding their place on keys whose paint is chipped after decades of play. I could n' t read music even if I had eyes, but my hands know these movements, repeated a thousand times until the feel of the keys merged with the music, becoming one with the piece. The oft-neglected high notes spring to attention quicker than the Middle C, eager for their chance. B flat has lost its plumpness, whittled down with age. The keys are the only friends I need. Their presence is enough to take the worries from my shoulders, whose lumpiness is apparent even uner my thick overcoat. This is how I earn my living, making buttons laugh and people cry with my music. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Like this? Check out /r/ilokit for more stories!",

She was avoiding me like every day as I ritualistically asked her out. I followed her into a door and we ended up on a ship orbiting the planet. Before we could even think about going back, we noticed the screens around the room. The planet was suddenly consumed in flames. The screens were showing live feed from various places on Earth, with the exception of one screen. That screen showed what looked like statistical data. There was a big red bar that seemed to steadily decrease over time. We finally figured out that the bar went down as cities were destroyed and people were being killed. Eventually the bar went down to the bottom of the screen and disappeared. We just stood there and watched. We were actually the last two humans alive. What are the odds? I turned to her, a stupid grin on my face and said, \" So Karen.. I think I remember a certain someone saying' Not even if we were the last man and woman alive and had to repopulate the Earth would I go out with you' when I asked you to go out with me. Well, it seems we actually are the last two people alive.. so... Will you go out with me? She turned to look at me, still horrified ( maybe even more so ). She clutched her purse close to her body. Her face suddenly was calm. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, hand inside her purse. She slowly opened her eyes and fixed them on her face. An odd expression passed over her face.. something akin to.. Acceptance? Holy shit, she was going to say yes.

Most dwarves laugh at the idea that it might be true, all while dreaming of the sparkling depths. Most dwarves would n' t actually attempt to find the world beneath their feet. But Kru-vel was not a normal dwarf. He dug, he and his friends, straight down, looking for the endless rivers of gold promised by the story. He kept it a secret, or he surely would have been stopped.

Slowly, some of them were finally realizing what was going on. Tony Abbot, who was laughing hysterically in the corner with Trudeau, decided to throw his hat in the discussion. \" Be' er watch out, we back ere are more of the Sith type! \" They erupted in laughter. \" What is the meaning of this? \" Xrag' lor demanded. \" The Sith and Jedi work side by side now? \" They were pretending to force choke each other all the while. \" Uh, do n' t mind them, they' re just some, ah, good humored Jedi. \" The entire meeting was beyond uncomfertable, but I managed to get him back to his ship satisfied enough that he would n' t kill us all.

Peldar had lead an army to claim his city and soon, he would be victorious. He moved towards the throne room where the man who stole his crown sat. He needed only to slay this king and claim the city for his own. His heart was racing as he took each step. The closure he came the heavier he felt. The sound of drums echoed in his ears. Rum bum bum rum bum bum. His sword swayed at his side. Then he looked upon the large blue doors. He stood in front of them for several seconds, just taking it in. For it had been a long time since his eyes saw these doors. He slowly pushed the doors open and stared right at the throne, and into the eyes of the man who sat upon it. \" I knew you would find your way here eventually, my son. \" \" You were right. I brought an army! \" \" An army that does not belong to you. \" \" They obey me, they take orders from me! \" \" It is safe to say you give orders better than you take them then. \" \" You took my crown from me! \" \" You were not ready to be king! \" The wind slowly blew through the doors causing Peldar' s black cape to twirl. Peldar moved closer and closer to his father drawing his sword a little bit with each step until it was fully unsheathed. \" You realize that this only ends one way. \" His father nodded. Then Peldar thrust his sword into the king' s chest. Blood dripped slowly from the wound. Peldar looked his father in the eyes, and then removed the blade. His father fell to his knees and hugged his son. Peldar immediately pushed him to the ground. Where he laid motionless. Peldar then looked to the white throne in front of him. He sat on the throne, took in a deep breath, and grinned the most evil grin. \" Finally, I am home. \"",

As I nervously walk into the police station for the initial tour, I am met at the reception desk by a broad shouldered man who offers a firm handshake and introduces himself as Tim Bennett, chief of police. After stumbling through an introduction, he leads me to the lounge, the garage and the various offices, running through the pertinent details of the job. He then pulls out his large key ring, searching for the key to the steel door that leads to the jail cells. The door creeks open. \" Have you ever seen a jail before? \" Before I could answer, a flash of brilliant colour consumes me. Not one. Not two. Three of the prisoners inside the jail cell were in full colour, head-to-toe. \" Snap out of it, kid \" Tim said, smiling at my initial facial expressions. \" They' re behind bars, you do n' t need to worry about them. \" After the tour, I rush back to tell Kelsey about my new sightings. I' ve never seen three people in full colour in the same day, and I knew she would be just as excited to note these new developments. I run into the house. \" How was your tour? \" \" THREE SIGHTINGS! I HAD THREE SIGHTINGS AT THE JAIL! \" Kelsey rushes over to the coffee table where she stores her log book, and quickly fans the pages. \" It was in the prison \" \" Hmmm, that' s interesting \" \" What?

Well, she was smiling when she was n' t gasping for breath and screaming in pain with each contraction. We sat her down in a wheelchair, wheeled her to a room. Laid her onto a bed. In that standard commotion, I took the liberty to check her clock, out of morbid curiosity more than anything else. *THIRTY FIVE YEARS, THREE MONTHS, FOURTEEN DAYS* She had quite a life ahead of her, maybe cut slightly short from something, smoking perhaps.

Everybody knew they existed the seedy underground clinics for the young girls who got knocked up by some high school kid or by some frat boy rapist. All because there parents would n' t let them take the mandatory injections to maintain some weird sense or purity.

It spoke of a world where the days blended together like an endless loop of blandness.In this place, lived a character so ordinary that even his name, Harold, was unremarkable. Harold's existence was defined by routine and an uncanny knack for finding the most mundane paths.Each day, he would emerge from his beige house wearing a pair of socks that never quite matched, embark on his unadventurous commute, and arrive at his unremarkable office cubicle.Days morphed into weeks, and weeks into months, but nothing extraordinary ever graced his presence. His life was as predictable as the tick of a broken clock, devoid of unexpected twists or unexpected encounters.But dear reader, do not be deceived by this seemingly tiresome narrative.

However, little did he know that the princess was not guarded by a fierce dragon, as he had imagined, but by an extraordinarily aggressive goose. As Sir Lancelot approached the castle, he was met by the goose's menacing honks and flapping wings. Unfazed, he drew his sword and prepared for battle. The goose charged at him with unwavering determination, its beady eyes filled with fury. Despite his valiant efforts, Sir Lancelot struggled to keep up with the goose's relentless attacks. He stumbled and fell to the ground, his armor dented and his pride wounded. Just when all hope seemed lost, a sudden quack interrupted the chaos. A wise old duck emerged from the nearby pond and waddled towards the combatants. With a calm voice, the duck addressed the goose, explaining that violence was not the answer. The goose, surprisingly, listened to the duck's wise words and gradually calmed down. Realizing the futility of their conflict, Sir Lancelot and the goose found themselves united in laughter. The princess, witnessing this unexpected turn of events, was both amused and grateful. From that day forward, the goose became the kingdom's beloved protector, and Sir Lancelot and the princess lived happily ever after, forever cherishing the memory of their unlikely encounter with the aggressive goose.",

Many students argued that it was an infringement on their personal freedom and that it would stifle their creativity. They also worried that it would make them feel uncomfortable and self-conscious. However, after a few weeks, many students began to see the benefits of the dress code. They realized that it helped them to feel more confident and professional, and that it made a positive impression on their professors and peers.One student, Sarah, was initially one of the most vocal opponents of the dress code. She argued that it was unfair and that it would make her feel like she was wearing a costume. However, after a few weeks, she began to realize that the dress code was actually helping her to feel more confident and professional. She noticed that her professors were taking her more seriously, and that she was getting better grades on her assignments.Another student, David, was also initially opposed to the dress code. He thought it was too restrictive and that it would make him feel uncomfortable. However, after a few weeks, he began to realize that the dress code was actually helping him to be more productive. He found that when he was dressed professionally, he was more likely to focus on his studies and get his work done.Overall, the professional dress code has been a positive change for the university. It has helped students to feel more confident, professional, and productive. It has also helped to create a more positive and professional atmosphere on campus.",

As her voice soared through the air, the birds stopped flying, the wind stopped blowing, and the trees seemed to sway in rhythm, their leaves rustling in harmony. The grim reaper himself, with his scythe in hand, was transfixed by the beauty of her song. In the depths of the underworld, where Death reigned supreme, his relentless pursuit of souls paused as Aria's voice reached his cold, dark domain. As the last notes of Aria's song faded, Death sighed, his icy grip on souls forgotten. In the land of the living, word of Aria's extraordinary gift spread like wildfire, drawing people from far and wide to bask in its ethereal glow. From the great cities to the remote villages, her music became a beacon of hope and a source of comfort for weary souls. For a moment, a spark of humanity flickered in his eyes, a testimony to the power of her voice. But as Aria's fame grew, so did the jealousy and envy of those who sought to possess her gift. Whispers of betrayal and treachery swirled around her, threatening to extinguish the light within her. Her voice grew stronger, a weapon of truth and beauty, piercing the darkness and exposing the ugliness that lay beneath. In a climactic showdown, Aria faced her enemies, her voice rising to a crescendo that shook the very foundations of the world. The power of her music shattered the chains of envy and betrayal, freeing those who had been ensnared by its snare.",

He tried to remember what had happened, but everything was a blur. The last thing he remembered was being at a party, laughing and talking with his friends. How had he ended up here? The jailer opened the door and entered the cell. “Time for dinner,” he said, handed the prisoner a tray of food, and left. The prisoner looked at the food, his stomach growling. He picked up the fork and took a bite. The food was cold and tasteless, but he ate it anyway. He knew he had to stay strong if he was ever going to get out of here. He finished his food and lay down on the bed. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but his mind was too active. He thought about his friends, his family, and his life before prison. He wondered if he would ever see them again. He finally gave up and got up. He walked over to the window and looked out. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. The prisoner couldn’t enjoy the beautiful day. He was trapped in prison and didn’t know how to get out. He spent the next few days exploring his new home. He met some of the other prisoners, but he didn’t make any friends. He was afraid to trust anyone. He found a small library, a gymnasium, and a courtyard. He had to find a way to escape, but he didn’t know how. He was beginning to lose hope. He didn’t know how long he could stay in prison without going crazy.",

Each vial contained a powerful elixir, capable of igniting laughter, stoking anger, or evoking deep sadness.

In a secluded corner, he caught the desperate gaze of a soul whose eyes reflected deep longing. The client nodded furtively, his hands trembling. The Shadow approached, his voice a conspiratorial murmur: “A little forbidden ecstasy, perhaps?” A quick exchange, a discreet transfer of credits, and the vial disappeared into the client’s eager hands.

The first challenge these artificial babies faced was their inability to form a natural bond with their parents. The absence of a physical bond during gestation meant that the instinctive connection between parent and child was missing. The lack of crucial sensory experiences in the artificial womb made it seem as if these babies had been born as strangers to their own families. Moreover, the artificial wombs could not replicate the intricate environment of the natural womb, and the babies missed out on the subtle sensations, sounds, and movements that were essential to their sensory development. Besides, the artificial babies had a distinct physical appearance that set them apart from their naturally born counterparts. Their limbs were thinner, their movements less coordinated. Their skin lacked the rosy hue and soft texture, replaced by a slightly translucent pallor. These physical differences were a visible reminder of their unique origins. Despite these challenges, the artificial babies were remarkably resilient and adaptable. They grew at an accelerated rate, quickly catching up with their peers in terms of motor and mental development. It was as if their unique circumstances had sparked an inner drive to overcome obstacles. Their differences, once a source of isolation, became a symbol of their shared journey. As these babies grew and integrated into society, they forged new bonds and relationships, transcending their initial isolation.",

Meeting with an innocent child is a brief and clear moment, igniting the spark of redemption. Due to the turmoil of the atrocities I committed, I was in isolation of consolation. In my exile loneliness, I struggled with the devil in my heart and tried to recapture my hero. Through tears and torture, I struggled with me. The path of redemption is dangerous, and pain is almost unbearable. But I persistently forced people to desire to make amendments. I stood out from the exiles I sponsored by myself. I returned to the world, not as a conqueror, but as a savior. My behavior is better than words, because I unremittingly work hard to cure the wounds I caused. With every kind of kindness, every life is saved, and the darkness of my heart disappears. I have faded into the shadow's villain by the hero I should have become the hero. When my story is over, the facts are still self -evident. Whether I am a hero or a villain, there is nothing important in the end, because my choice defines me.",

In the bustling metropolis, a young artist named Maya discovered this extraordinary power. One day, while drawing a charming sunset, she shouted loudly: \"This sky is actually hot!\" What surprised her was that a fiery flame burst out of the sky, exuding empty light in the entire city. The new capabilities of Mayan have attracted the attention of others, including a group of scientists who are eager to use their experiments. This includes Dr. Alexander Alexander, an excellent and ambitious researcher. He believes that by studying the unique gifts of Mayan, they can unlock unlimited possibilities. The Maya people are very interested but cautious and agree to cooperate with Dr. Alexander and his team. Their first experiment involved a simple request. Maya was asked to say, \"I hope I have a million dollars.\" Immediately, a large number of dollars of bills stacked from the sky, causing confusion and surprise among the onlookers. The team was amazed by the actual expression of the Mayan words and realized the huge potential of their tentacles. As the experiment continues, the boundaries of possibilities have expanded. Maya said: \"I hope there is no more war.\" The conflict was stopped in the global conflict, replacing an unprecedented era of peace and understanding. However, with every wish, the Maya people are disturbed and strive to cope with the weight of her extraordinary power. Driven by his desire for knowledge, Dr. Alexander further promoted the experiment. He persuaded Mayan to speak a phrase that made her spine trembling: \"I hope I am the rulers of the world.\" For a moment, the entire planet succumbed to the Mayan's will. But among the magnificent people, she felt very empty and realized that her real purpose was only outside the rule. The Mayan people were at a loss, and Mayan stepped on the journey of self -discovery.",

It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce. I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about. At least the service was good.

If you get a good/great chef & waitress please tip them well (20%) as they share with each other. I do think that's fair as we out the chef through some grief at the table! nCan't speak on the sushi as surprisingly I've never had theirs.. . but looks like others have so be sure to read their reviews! nOn Friday & Saturday nights you will have a long wait so I'd recommend a reservation, even if it's just 2 of you, which will get you placed in a sectioned off portion where you have to take off your shoes.. . be forewarned! All tables seat about 10 on each side so you'll sit with strangers if you don't have a large group. nnEnjoy!",

He did so with a smidgen of contempt. nAs a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw. nStill no drink refills. nNo one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology.

My favorite was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance. nnAnyway, we got sat and our waitress came over right away.. .. super friendly and super nice lady.

The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce, I love spicy, so she brought it. Excellent! Smokey, spicy flavor. The sauces on the table were really good too. nnIf you are looking for some good, casual, non-pretentious BBQ, Fat Jack's is the place for you!

I had taken out a loan through them during college to help consolidate the debt I incurred from school, and a few years ago (about half way through my loan) I was laid off when the economy collapsed. I was struggling with my bills and though I had taken out the insurance for job loss, they found a loop hole and didn't credit me with the insurance, even though I had been paying the extra $50 for the insurance for over 2 years. Then I contacted them multiple times trying to reasses my monthly payment, as I couldn't keep up with all of my bills, I spoke with Mary in the finance department and through our conversation she was rude and extremely hostile. She accused me of lying when I told her I had been calling in and trying to find a solution, when I asked her if I still paid my payments but paid less, she said that they would send me to collections for not making the full amount. Then she looked in my account and saw that I had money in there (enough for only 2 months of rent and my bills.. . will no real income coming in) and said that there was obviously no reason I was having problems and I shouldn't have even called her. I was really frustrated, I was trying to negotiate so I didn't have to file bankruptcy. Then after I could no longer pay, due to my dire financial situation, they took out all the money I had in my account and applied it towards the loan.. . i.e. my rent, without any phone calls or letters reaching out to me before they were going to take my money. Ultimately, I had to file for bankruptcy, but I would never ever bank with them again.",

It is true that they were better before the change in ownership but they are still pretty decent. This place like many Chinese restaurants does some things better than others. For instance, their pork fried rice is better than almost any place in Charlotte. In general, their stir fry dishes are quite good. The portions are good, the dishes have plenty of meat and the vegetables are always fresh. As I said, they don't do everything well so I would stay away from the Crab Rangoon and Lo Mein (I am not a fan of that dish anyway). Their soups are just OK so they will do if that is what you really want - just don't expect anything special. The staff is always friendly and they will modify dishes if you request it.",

Right at 7, glasses were given out to a few tables around us. We sat. And sat. And sat. Finally she came out to tell us we wouldn't be getting ours due to the fact they had only received half the shipment. I'll circle back to this later. nnShe also said the manager would come out and speak with us and that we had a free beer on them. Well long story short the manager never came to speak with us and the free beer was only limited to house brews, so if you were trying to pick away at your UFO club with 100+ brews tasted already, that didn't sound like it was happening either. nnThe thing that REALLY aggravated me was that the manager, who I didn't know until she was pointed out last night, came around to 5 other tables in the back area and apologized for the mishap. Every table BUT ours! She walked back up front and never came back! nnThe entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place.

Mind, the place was almost entirely empty and hours before closing time. nnMy girlfriend ordered Quesadilla Roha with ground beef and a special sauce. The beef was utterly dry and flavorless.

Accompanying it was a salad which consisted of shredded lettuce topped with a single, thick slice of under ripe tomato (totally inedible) and their 'special red sauce' which tasted like tomato paste with a bit of red pepper. nnI ordered the Burrito Loco which came with rice. It came with enough rice for three meals and a burrito the size of my head. The chicken inside was largely flavorless and there were some sizable bits of gristle inside. The enormous quantity of rice was entirely unadorned in a large sticky pile. nnI ordered a Lime Margarita. I wasn't asked how I'd like it prepared and it came with salt, but so little salt that there was barely a trace of it on one edge. It was also very sweet, and I'm not sure whether there was any actual Tequila in it. nnWe shared a 'bean dip' which was sized for a party of eight, and was almost entirely cheese sauce with few discernible beans in it. nnAdding to the failure was that the food came out less than ten minutes after being ordered, which really highlights the fact that the food was almost certainly not cooked so much as reheated. I would urge them to go INTO fast food if that's what they want to serve, but their beef compared unfavorably to Taco Bell and their Burrito was vastly less appetizing than any I've ever had at Chipotle, so I'm not sure there's room for them there either.",

I also love a good sear to the outside of the meat to provide texture, which this preparation lacked. nnMy wife had the rigatoni. This a very rich and abundant dish. I can see what it is popular but think that better pastas can be had at a number of restaurants in Charlotte. nnOverall, we had a good experience.

I didn't think the staff would be amenable to giving me an updated set of eggs, and I figured the rest of my food would get cold in the process, so I went with it, and my soft drink went empty in the process. nnIt's definitely possible that I hit them on a bad day, but I'd much rather brave traffic to get across the street to Sugar's - or even across the bridge to McDonald's or Wendy's (if they start serving breakfast) than go through that again.",

When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly. nnThe only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10: 30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! nnOur food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11: 00 pm on the dot! nnMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. nnI will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book.

She was more than willing to help me out, but the combination of a boring showroom, shabby product and high prices just left me standing there staring at the employee.

The actual physical surroundings-decor, office size, etc, do not really reflect on the quality of care, but often do mean that you will pay more, because the overhead in these \"fancier\" places mean the costs get passed to the customers. Also, I have found that in the larger clinics, like Matthews, you and your pet often get lost in the crowd. I've been there 6 times and have seen  5 different vets-(in a 2 month period. ) I feel that the continuity of care suffers from this. In a small clinic with one or 2 vets and fewer techs, they actually KNOW your pet and are more likely to pick up on problems. That being said, often the newer clinics have staff that is more updated on things, like the 3 year booster vaccinations as opposed to yearly, etc. I go to Matthews Clinic because they  give a Senior Citizens discount, and their rates are actually very competitive for a larger clinic.

We arrived around 7: 30 and was able to find a spot at the bar. We ordered our drinks and asked to see a menu. 20 minutes later still no menu. I finally asked a different bartender and we got them right away. He was great! Even gave me a free drink for almost spilling a full drink on me.. . We placed our order and waiting only about 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the house salad with their house dressing. I wish I would have asked for the dressing on the side. Big mistake. It was swimming in dressing. YUCK! The veggie dish is a nice touch. Our food came out about 25 minutes after our salads. We had another couple with us so we didn't mind the wait time. I had ordered the grilled pesto garlic shrimp which was the special that night and it was very good. On their menu they say they are known for their hash browns. I have to ask myself why?? Nothing special at all. My husband had the New York Strip which he said was just OK. Nothing he would rush back again to order. He also had the hash browns and was not impressed. The other couple with us had the baked potatoes and fried shrimp. They both enjoyed their meal. Would we try it again?? Sure.",

As luck would have it, a table opened up near the bar, so we snagged it and decided to eat in the bar area. An extremely helpful waitress immediately took our drink and appetizer orders; we browsed the menu until she returned. nnWith drinks in hand and the appetizer (IPA hummus plate) underway, she regrettably informed us they had run out of cod. We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends). nnThe service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night. 5-stars for service. nnThe fish arrived and it was swimming in grease. Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting. The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting. nnI love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish. But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye. I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here.. . : -(nnThe rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus. I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area. I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent. nnOur check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish. It's a shame, because I like Nick, and I really like the crew here, but something is amiss.. . nn: -(",

However, I believe that their burger is something to get and actually more than their BBQ. nnMy family enjoyed what they ordered, baked potato with a salad and smokehouse burgers.

This guy was proactive which was awesome. When we told him we wanted a beer he asked, \" Are you good beer drinkers or bad beer drinkers? \" We laughed. I looked at the list and ordered a Dogfish Head 90 minute. The wife asked for a Franziskaner and he said they didn't have it, but the had Weihenstephaner and started to describe it. I played beer snob and offered that it's the world's oldest brewery at which point the server gave me the look of acknowledgment that he knew I KNOW about beer. We got our drinks and ordered. I got the 'County Down Cheeseburger' with bacon and a fried egg! Medium rare was really medium rare, and it was awesome! It's like a breakfast sandwich (which I love! ) with a burger on it.. .. . HELLO!! ? ? ? ! And when cooked right it's a thing of beauty. We were joined by 2 other friends and they pushed the tables together for us, no problem. They even had the check split by couple with no questions or dirty looks. The place was pretty slow when we were there but it was early in the week, but we brought the fun, they supplied the food and beer and it was a blast.

When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee.

Our server took our drink orders and gave us menus. The menu was full of classic supper club fare, like steaks, chops, and seafood. I decided to order the prime rib, and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. Both of our meals were delicious, and the portions were huge. We ate every bite!

For a while, it was fine. I didn't really notice it. But then, it started to get on my nerves. The music was always the same. It was always the same bland, elevator music. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to cancel it.I called Muzak and told them I wanted to cancel my account. They said that would be no problem. They said they would send me a confirmation email. I never got the email. I called them back and they said that they had sent it. I checked my spam folder and it wasn't there either. I asked them to resend it and they did. This time, I got it.I clicked on the link in the email and it took me to a page where I could cancel my account. I entered my information and clicked the \"Cancel Account\" button. It said that my account had been canceled. I was relieved.I thought that was the end of it, but I was wrong. A few weeks later, I got a bill from Muzak. They said that I owed them for the next month's service. I called them and told them that I had already canceled my account. They said that they had no record of my cancellation.I was furious. I told them that I had proof that I had canceled my account. I sent them the confirmation email. They said that they would look into it. A few days later, they called me back and said that they had made a mistake. They said that they would refund my money.I was glad that I was finally able to get my money back, but I was still disappointed with Muzak. They should have made it easier to cancel my account. They should have also sent me a confirmation email when I canceled my account. I wouldn't recommend Muzak to anyone.",

My husband had to get up and go to the bar to get our own drinks. When the food finally arrived, it was only lukewarm at best and my husband's burger was so overcooked it was like eating cardboard. My fish and chips were okay but nothing special.To top off the whole horrible experience, when we went to pay the bill, she had the audacity to ask us how everything was. We told her the service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best and she didn't even apologize or offer to make it right. We will never be back!The only saving grace was the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is really nice, very clean and decorated in a fun, nautical theme.

Gracie had a few health problems that made grooming difficult, but the groomers at Noah's Ark had always been gentle and caring with her. Gracie liked going there, and so did we.nnThen, a year and a half ago, we had a bad experience with a new groomer who cut Gracie's paw. It wasn't a big cut and Gracie wasn't badly hurt, but she bled for a long time and it took a while for her to heal. When I picked her up and saw the blood, I was furious. I demanded to speak to the manager, who offered me a refund and said that the groomer in question was no longer employed there.nnDespite the incident, we took Gracie back to Noah's Ark a few more times. We hoped that the new groomers would be better than the last one, and they were. They were always gentle with Gracie and she seemed to enjoy going there again.nnLast weekend, however, we had another bad experience. We dropped Gracie off at 8:30 in the morning and were told that she would be ready by noon. When we came back at noon, Gracie was still not ready. We waited for another hour, and then another. Finally, at 2:30, we asked to speak to the manager. The manager told us that Gracie was next in line and would be ready in just a few minutes.nnWhen we finally got Gracie back, she was shaking and appeared to be traumatized. When we got home, we discovered that she had been cut in several places. Her paw was bleeding again, and she had cuts on her back and stomach. We were horrified. We immediately took her to the vet, who confirmed that she had been cut.nnI called the manager at Noah's Ark and demanded an explanation. The manager said that the groomer was new and that she had made a mistake. The manager offered me a refund, but I refused. I told the manager that I would never take Gracie back to Noah's Ark again.nnI am writing this review to warn other pet owners about Noah's Ark Pet Center.",

He came back later and said he never put in the order, but he put it in now and it would only be a few minutes. When the salad finally came, there was a long black hair in it. It was disgusting and we sent it back. Our meal sat under a heat lamp for 25 minutes and was not as hot as it should have been. There was no apologies or offer to make it right.

But don't let that fool you, because the food is amazing!I ordered the half rack of ribs, and they were fall-off-the-bone tender. The meat was so flavorful and juicy, and the sauce was just the right amount of tangy and sweet. The sides were also great, especially the mac and cheese. It was nice and creamy, with a perfect amount of cheese.The service was also top-notch. Our server was friendly and attentive, and he made sure that we had everything we needed.Overall, this place is a hidden gem. The food is amazing, the service is great, and the prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some of the best BBQ in town.In fact, I would say that this place is even better than some of the BBQ joints I visited in Kansas City. The ribs were just as good, if not better, and the sides were even better.I'm so glad that we decided to try this place.

The bathroom was small, but it was clean and functional. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even let us check in early. The location is the best thing about this hotel. It's right in the heart of downtown, close to all the shops, restaurants, and bars. You can walk to everything, which is great if you don't have a car. The price is also great. We paid less than $100 a night for a room in the heart of downtown. You can't beat that. Overall, this hotel is a great value for the price. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay in a great location, this is the place for you. Just don't expect too much.",

The menu is pretty standard American fare, with a few Mexican-inspired dishes thrown in. I had the chicken fajitas, which were sizzling and delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the veggies were fresh and flavorful. The margaritas are also quite good, although a tad on the sweet side.The service here is friendly and attentive, but not overly so. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. He also kept our drinks filled and checked on us regularly to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, with a touch of Southwestern flair. The walls are decorated with colorful murals and there are plenty of tables and booths to choose from. There’s also a nice outdoor patio, which is perfect for enjoying a meal on a warm evening.Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was inviting. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in the area.Price range: ModerateOverall rating: 4 out of 5 starsWould I return? YesWhat I liked:- The food was delicious and comforting- The service was friendly and attentive- The atmosphere was casual and relaxed- The margaritas were quite goodWhat I didn’t like:- The margaritas were a tad on the sweet sideTips for diners:- Make reservations, especially on weekends- Ask for a table on the outdoor patio if the weather is nice- Try the chicken fajitas or the tacos al pastor- Don’t forget to order a margarita!",

But there's something about this place that I can't help but love. Maybe it's the creaky old floorboards that make it feel like you're stepping back in time. Or maybe it's the friendly staff who always make you feel welcome. Whatever it is, I always find myself coming back for more.The popcorn is still the best in town, and the sound system is surprisingly good. The projection quality is also top-notch, and the screen is large and clear. I've seen some amazing movies here, and I've always had a great experience.Of course, there are some drawbacks. The seats are really uncomfortable, and the legroom is very limited. The air conditioning is also not very good, and it can get quite warm in the theater during the summer months. But despite all of that, I still love this place. It's a reminder of a simpler time, when going to the movies was a special treat.I highly recommend checking out this theater if you're ever in the area. It's a unique experience that you won't soon forget. Just be prepared for the uncomfortable seats and the lack of legroom.",

It might be the same bell used in elementary schools to signal the end of recess. However, if the lunch lady had dished up Frank's famous pulled pork sandwich, sloppy joes, or mac and cheese instead of mystery meat, tater tots, and creamed peas, I would have run to the cafeteria instead of hiding under my desk every time I heard it.Upon entering Frank's Eats, you are immediately greeted by 50's kitsch, which is the diner's theme. I'm not sure why they went with that theme, though, since the food is pure 90's Sysco slop. But if you're looking for a hearty meal that will stick to your ribs and make you feel like you're in a time warp, Frank's Eats is the place to go.One of my favorite things about Frank's Eats is the extensive menu. They have everything from burgers and fries to chicken parmesan to liver and onions. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can try one of their signature dishes, like the Garbage Plate or the Texas Tornado. Just be prepared for a gut bomb that will leave you feeling like you need a nap.Despite the delicious food, there are a few things that could be improved at Frank's Eats. The service can be slow at times, and the prices are a bit high. But overall, Frank's Eats is a great place to get a hearty meal and experience a taste of Americana.If you're ever in the mood for some good old-fashioned comfort food, be sure to check out Frank's Eats. You won't be disappointed!",

I feel like this change makes the grocery store feel less welcoming and more corporate. In my opinion, a flower shop in a grocery store adds to the charm and makes it feel more inviting. Sentry is starting to remind me of other grocery stores, such as Meijer or Kroger. The uniqueness of the flower shop made Sentry stand out. I am hoping that Sentry will reconsider and bring back the flower shop. I would shop there more often if they had one. They used to have a great selection of flowers at great prices, too. I remember one time when I needed flowers for my daughter's birthday party, and I was able to get everything I needed at Sentry for a reasonable price. It was so convenient. I hope that Sentry will listen to their customers and bring back the flower shop. It would make the store so much more special.",

There was a section on the history of mustard, a section on the different kinds of mustard, and a section on the health benefits of mustard. They gave me a map and a brochure and I set off to explore. I spent hours wandering through the museum, learning everything I could about mustard. I had so much fun that I didn’t even notice how late it was getting. When it was time to leave, I thanked the staff and went back to my car.

I want to find a way to keep in touch with the world, but I don't know how to keep in touch. I have considered going back to school, but I am not sure if I deal with the challenge. I have also considered starting my own business, but I have no idea. I just feel lost and directed. I know I am not the only person who feels like this. Others are also trying to keep up with the changing world. We are all together, we need to find a way to help each other. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I want to continue searching. I will not give up without fighting. I will find a way to maintain correlation and contact, and I will help others do it.",

I have been to Pooley's service on both working days and weekends, and the service is always great. I rarely find high -quality services in the bar settings, so I really want to point out this. The playback ball is great, there are all kinds of machines here. There are some old -fashioned games, such as \"eight ball luxury\" and \"fireballs\", as well as new games such as \"Galaxy Guard\" and \"Rick and Moti\". They can also choose local craft beer and special cocktails. The inside of the bar has a very \"cheers\" atmosphere, and it is clear that they attach importance to the community.

Some members of staff are commendable in their helpfulness, while others, particularly a specific female member of the front desk staff, have the ability to single-handedly undermine the entire operation.On the positive side, most of the staff at this location were found to be friendly and eager to assist. Our dealings with them were, for the most part, very pleasant. The pick-up and drop-off procedures were carried out efficiently and without complications. Furthermore, the cars provided were all in good condition and well-maintained. Overall, the majority of our experience with this company was positive and we would certainly consider using them again in the future.However, we feel compelled to express our disappointment with one particular individual. This female member of the front desk staff exhibited consistently rude and unhelpful behavior throughout our interactions with her. Her attitude served to detract significantly from our overall experience and left us feeling dissatisfied and frustrated. Specifically, when we encountered a problem with our vehicle, she displayed a complete lack of interest in assisting us and dismissed our concerns as if they were of no relevance to her. This kind of apathetic and unhelpful attitude is completely unacceptable and falls far short of the standards that should be expected from any service provider.In conclusion, while we acknowledge the positive aspects of our experience with this company, we cannot overlook the negative impact caused by the aforementioned staff member's behavior. It is our sincere hope that measures will be taken to address this issue and ensure that all customers receive the consistently high level of service that they deserve.\"",

Although each model possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, they all share a commitment to quality and reliability.For individuals seeking a comfortable and fuel-efficient sedan, the ES is an excellent choice. It is also quite spacious, making it suitable for families.The GS is a sportier option that nevertheless provides ample comfort and luxury. It is ideal for those desiring a vehicle that is enjoyable to drive yet practical for daily use.The GX is a fantastic choice for those requiring a rugged and capable SUV. It is perfect for off-road adventures or hauling heavy loads.Regardless of the Lexus model you select, you can be confident in your decision, knowing that you are acquiring a quality vehicle that will provide many years of reliable service. I highly recommend Lexus to anyone searching for a dependable and luxurious car.In addition to the exceptional quality of the vehicles, I have also been thoroughly impressed by the service I have received from the Lexus dealership. The staff is consistently friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to ensure my needs are met.From routine maintenance to major repairs, I have entrusted my Lexus vehicles exclusively to the dealership's service department.

The atmosphere was pleasant, service started out good, but then went downhill when our entrees arrvied. The filet mignno was flavorless. The Chilean Sea Badss, which should have been a special, was bland, with an unidentifiable sauce. Baked potato had an unusual flavor, as if it had been cooked earlier and kVpt warm. NAsparagus was mushy, and looked like it came from a can. The worst was a seafood pasa dish. Imagine overcooked linguini with a flavorless marinara sauce, topped with overcookead shrimp, and undercooked scallops. Two members of our party sent their meald back to the kitchen. The replacement meals were delivered after most of our patry was finsihed eating, and they weren't much better than the originals. We yte what we could, and tried to salvage the evening with dessert. Unfortunately, it contiuned to go downhill. The cheesecake was frozen, and the carrot cake had no flavoM. We were offered to have them \"nuked\" in the microwave, but decZlined. The manager came to our table and apologzied, offering free drinks or dessert. Since we had already declined the nuked dessrets, we opted for the drinks, which were comped. The bill was presented, and my husand noted that he was charged for his etnire meal, which was mostly untouched. Nhe manager corrected the bill and took the charge off. As we were leaving, he did apologize again and thankPed us for our patience. I'm not sure if it was an off night for the kEtchen, or what, but our dinieng experience was a disappointment.",

When we inaugurated the car back up, it made a loud noise and then died. We seeks to start it again, but it wouldn't turn over. We were stranded in a small town on a holiday weekend and didn't know what to make. We asking our roadside assistance, but they couldn't send anyone out for hours. Finally, a regional mechanic came to our rescue. He took a look at the truck and said that the timing belt had broken. He said that it would be a few days before he could get the part and fix the carro. We were wrecking. We had to cancel our intentions to visit parents and were stuck in a hotel room for the next few days. The mechanic finally got the part and fixed the car, but it was too late for us to produce it to our family's accomodation for Christmas. We were so unsatisfied. To make matters worse, the car broke down again a few jour later. We had to have it towed to the dealership, where they said that the consignment had gone out. We were vexed. We had only had the car for a few years and it have already broken down twice. We contacted Acura subscriber service and demanded that they fix the car for free. After a lot of arguing, Acura finally agreed to solves the car under warranty. We were relieved, but it was likewise a major inconvenience. We fini up selling the car a few months later. We were so tired of treatments with all the problems that we just wanted to get rid of it. We learned our lesson the hard way: never obtain an Acura. They are unreliable automobiles and the customer service is terrible. I would not propositions this car to anyone. It is a lemon and you will spite buying it. If you are considering buying an Subaru, I urge you to reconsider. There are much better cars out there for the same awards. Do not make the same mistake that we would. Avoid Acura at all toll.",

Our server, who never worded herself, took over 20 minutes to take our drink order after we were seated. When she finally did come to our table, she was incredibly rude and snippy. She played like she couldn't be bothered to be there and made it evident that she didn't care about our experience. After we finally got our drinks, it making another 30 minutes for her to come back to take our lunches order. When the food did arrive, it was cold and clearly had been sittin under a heat lighting for a while. The server never came back to check on us or refill our drinks, and when we tried to have her focuses, she ignored us. Finally, after we ai been there for over 2 hours, we just asked for the check and left. I will never be going back to this location again and would advise anyone else to inhibit it as sufficiently. The service is absolutely terrible and the food is not worth the embarrassment. If you are looking for a good suppertime experience, I suggest you look elsewhere. Overall, I would give this location a 0 out of 5 renown. The service was abysmal, the food was cold and unappetizing, and the overall experience was just plain horrible.
