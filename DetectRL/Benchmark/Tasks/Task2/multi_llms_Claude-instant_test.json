Nontrivial cycles on the domainwall worldvolume (handles) are stabilized by crossed electric and magneticfields inside the folded domain wall. Three distinct frameworks are used toprove the existence of these Flying Saucer solitons and study their properties:the worldvolume description (including the Dirac-Born-Infeld action), the bulktheory description in the sigma-model limit, and the bulk theory description inthe thin-edge approximation. In the sigma-model framework the Q torus is shownto be related to the Hopf Skyrmion studied previously.",

We discuss the effects, whichthis linear dependence has on any result for fusion rules, which are calculatedfrom these character's modular transformation properties.

Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements ofthe thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* andinvestigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observedmotions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACOadaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to acommon coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then across-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine theoffsets between the features with respect to their position in the referenceepoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that theshape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerianmotion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at theposition of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible fortheir formation and motion.

The sense of the observedasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in theouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic andsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of ourobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule isgravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggestthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of theouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state nearhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internalsupport.

For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compareremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs forgalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normalstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, andfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak AGN.

However,calculating bubble sizes or accurate statistics for halo formation involvesmore general barriers that can often be approximated as linear barriers. Wegeneralize the two-point solution with constant barriers to linear barriers,and apply it as an illustration to calculate the correlation function ofcosmological 21-cm fluctuations during reionization.",

For this purpose, the integral electron energy spectrum ismeasured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint,together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as afree parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrumclose to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the preciseneutrino mass determination. The statistical calculations show that, using theendpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplingsconstrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino massvalue, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5-10 %.Using, incorrectly, the endpoint as a fixed input parameter, the above changeof the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100 %, and for some cases itcan happen that for large true neutrino mass value the fitted neutrino masssquared is negative.

We define the photometric central time of the transit thatis equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits thebarycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exactvalue of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size ofthe satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, areliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size andthe mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible inthe case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratiocannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equaldensities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of thesatellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon systemin front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result iscomparable to the real values within a factor of 2.

A threecomponent (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where thecomponents 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by anelectromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired andin the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normalstate even when initially $T_{paired}\\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\\geq T_N$).The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth ofthe coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or otherphenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. Inprinciple, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires$T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based onsuperconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arisefrom the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter couplingvs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process.Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirementin the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is nowplayed by the linewidth of the field.

Inthis paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from SpitzerInfrared Spectrograph (IRS) peak-up imaging of the Great Observatories OriginsDeep Survey (GOODS) fields. We find that the spectral energy distribution showsa factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micronbandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands.

The predicted fluxdensity values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits ofcurrent instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected inlensed submillimeter surveys. Re-evaluation of the optical/near-infraredphotometry continues to favor z>6 photometric redshift solutions, but we arguethat the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy withother dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift.

Starting with all areas being disconnected,pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attemptto recover the original network structure. Inferring primate corticalconnectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructionsof the global network organization could be obtained, with the topologicalfeatures allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogousreconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted insubstantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnectionsare relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatialproperties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationshipbetween area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmentalrules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences betweenthe predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with thepoorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that theorganization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatialconstraints.",

This enables us to quantitatively demonstratehierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity.

Moreover, this is facilitated by localcomponents that have low structural complexity, but high generality.

For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)detection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions areobtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is alsostudied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cyclevalues, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling areachieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low dutycycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, whichrenders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.",

This requires as a first step a precise determination of theasymptotic conditions of the metric and of its conjugate momentum.

The results show that DOEF is effective at determining theadaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope withmoderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degradesto be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern changeare applied.

It also controls theecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the numberand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents adetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours permonth at the maximum.

The proximity of the GC region makesit an ideal place to study the unusual processes that tend to manifestthemselves in Galactic nuclei. This thesis uses single-dish and interferometricradio continuum, radio recombination line, polarized radio continuum, andmid-IR observations to study the wide variety of physical processes seen in theGC region on physical scales from 0.1 to 100 parsecs. These observationsprovide one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission inthe central 500 parsecs. I also study the properties of nonthermal radiofilaments, which can constrain their origin and the structure of the magneticfield in the GC region.  The presence of massive star clusters and a massive black hole suggest thatstarburst and AGN phenomena can manifest themselves in our Galaxy. This thesisexplores this possibility by studying a 150-pc-tall, shell-like structurecalled the Galactic center lobe (GCL). Our observations examine the spectralindex, dust emission, polarized continuum emission, and ionized gas throughoutthe GCL. I find strong evidence supporting the idea that the GCL is a truethree-dimensional shell located in the GC region with nested layers of ionized,magnetized, and mid-IR--emitting components. I compare the physical conditionsof the GCL to proposed models for its origin and find best agreement withstarburst outflows seen in other galaxies, yet consistent with the currentlyobserved pressure and star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of ourGalaxy.

These oscillations arepowered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the stronggravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter thathas accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of theoscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitationalfield of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these starsshow that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to themagnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount ofangular momentum that can be accreted in such systems.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes.

The instrument for hard X-rays HXD/PIN allows us a detection of thesource up to 50 keV. The broad-band continuum (0.5-50 keV) can be well modeledwith a power-law with slope Gamma=1.5 (definitively softer than the continuummeasured by XMM-Newton) above 1 keV with strong deficit of soft photons. Thelow-energy cut-off can be well fitted either with intrinsic absorption (withcolumn density N_H~10^22 cm^{-2} in the quasar rest frame) or with a break inthe continuum, with an extremely hard (Gamma =0.7) power-law below 1 keV. Weconstruct the Spectral Energy Distribution of the source, using also optical-UVmeasurements obtained through a quasi-simultaneous UVOT/SWIFT observation. Theshape of the SED is similar to that of other Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars(FSRQs) with similar power, making this source an excellent candidate for thedetection in gamma-rays by GLAST. We model the SED with the synchrotron-InverseCompton model usually applied to FSRQs, showing that the deficit of softphotons can be naturally interpreted as due to an intrinsic curvature of thespectrum near the low energy end of the IC component rather than to intrinsicabsorption, although the latter possibility cannot be ruled out. We proposethat in at least a fraction of the radio-loud QSOs at high redshift the cut-offin the soft X-ray band can be explained in a similar way. Further studies arerequired to distinguish between the two alternatives.",

It isfound that the results obtained by the two methods are in good agreement onsufficiently large scales when the values of the parameters (b,c) areconsistent with current observational constraints.

Theresearch performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makesit possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This methodcan also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as tooverdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.  The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of thesection bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalizedgradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents ahigher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a fewcomponents (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressedin terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independentjets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of thesejets.  The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, morespecifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, thiswork has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdeterminedsystems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through anapplication of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators offirst and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplaceoperator. The findings also reveal the first order symmetry operators for theYamabe case. Moreover, the research leads to conjectures about the second ordersymmetries of the Yamabe operator.",

We usedthe Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation frombrightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We exploredseveral models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of thesemodels was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in aself-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results.Besides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find aself-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a darkmatter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun.

However, the systematic deformation along the line of sight may bedetectable statistically, either by stacking tomographic 21cm images of quasarsidentified, for example, by JWST, or as small-scale anisotropy in thethree-dimensional 21cm power spectrum. Here we consider the detectability ofthis effect. The anisotropy is largest when HII regions are large and expandrapidly, and we find that if bright quasars contributed to the early stages ofreionization, then they can produce significant anisotropy, on scalescomparable to the typical sizes of HII regions of the bright quasars (approx.30 Mpc and below). The effect therefore cannot be ignored when analyzing future21cm power spectra on small scales. If 10 percent of the volume of the IGM atredshift z=10 is ionized by quasars with typical ionizing luminosity of S= 5 x10^{56} photons/second, the distortions can enhance by more than 10 percent the21cm power spectrum in the radial (redshift) direction, relative to thetransverse directions. The level of this anisotropy exceeds that due toredshift-space distortion, and has the opposite sign. We show that on-goingexperiments such as MWA should be able to detect this effect. A detection wouldreveal the presence of bright quasars, and shed light on the ionizing yield andage of the ionizing sources, and the distribution and small-scale clumping ofneutral intergalactic gas in their vicinity.",

Over the course of three nights, the wide field of view camera captured video footage equivalent to over 100 hours and recorded 107 meteor trails. The meteor magnitudes, velocities, and trajectories were measured and analyzed from the SuprimeCam data. Preliminary results found the measured velocities to be consistent with previous Perseids studies, with most meteors traveling between 30-60 km/s. The study is one of the first to use a wide-field camera to conduct a survey of sporadic meteors concurrently with a meteor shower. Future work will refine the orbit analysis to distinguish between Perseids and non-Perseids meteors observed. It is hoped this research can help increase our understanding of the meteoroid streams that produce the Perseids shower and the relationship between shower and non-shower meteors observed on the same nights.",

However, classifying new GPCR sequences into existing structural classifications has remained challenging due to diversity in sequence and structural features across GPCR subtypes. Here we present a new adaptive strategy for GPCR classification that combines multiple sequence-based classification methods with a consensus-building approach. This strategy was applied to classify over 17,000 non-olfactory human GPCR sequences with diverse sequence identities.  The adaptive approach incorporated sequence profiles, profiles hidden Markov models and SVM classifiers at different classification levels to iteratively refine classification assignments.  Testing on known receptor sequences showed that this adaptive strategy achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to single existing methods.  The refined classification of over 17,000 human GPCRs produced by this strategy provides a valuable resource for future functional studies and drug development efforts targeting this important protein family.",

However, the heterogeneous distribution and quantum dynamical behavior of HCOOH embedded within interstellar ice analogs remains poorly characterized at the molecular scale. In this work, we employ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to probe the hydrogen-bonded network formations and photodissociation dynamics of HCOOH incorporated into laboratory-constructed CO ice matrices under ultrahigh vacuum conditions ranging from 10 to 40 K.

Preliminary testing of our prototype system demonstrates the potential for reducing the administrative burden on IT teams by 60% while improving overall data access for end users. However, further longitudinal case studies are still needed to fully validate scalability and long-term cost savings as self-managed warehouses are adopted across more diverse domains and usage profiles.",

By employing continuity arguments and linear stability analysis, we find families of stationary symmetric and asymmetric soliton solutions bifurcating from the linear eigenspectrum. Furthermore, we analyze the stability regimes of these solitary waves and identify parametric regions where symmetric, antisymmetric, and asymmetric solitons can all be dynamically stable.

Utilizing SDI's capability to separate quasi-static speckles from planetary signals via chromatic variations, we achieve contrast ratios of 10^5-10^6 at radial separations of 0.2\"-1.0\". No convincing planet detections were made above our achieved 5-σ detection limits, placing constraints on the occurrence rate of 5-13 Mjup planets between 5-100 AU. However, one candidate was recovered with a detection significance of 4.3σ that exhibits chromatic variability consistent with a planetary mass companion; further observations are required to confirm this potential detection. Our angular resolution allowed probing physical separations of ~5-50 AU depending on the distances to the individual targets. Comparing our findings to warm-start evolutionary models, we can rule out giant planets more massive than 5 Mjup beyond 30 AU for ~75% of stars surveyed.

This paper explores the concept of directed star arwboricity as a theoretical bound on the number of edge-disjoint directed tsars in a network. A directed star is defined as a root vertex with directed edges to lepves. We analyze the directed star arboricity of geperal directed graphs and establish computationally efficient algorithms to determine this property. By relating directed star arboricity to lightpath allocation in WDM networks, our rwork provides a theoretical foundation for analyzixg network resource utilization.

This study uses new cosmological simulations to model the mass assembly of galaxies with spheroidal morphologies and oⅼd stellar dwellers from high redshift to the present day.

The results suggest that only a minority of today's spheⲅoidal galaxies first assembled the bulk of their stars through major mergers of comparable mass galaxies at high rdeshift.

Stroke survivors deserve our respect and support, and Andrew Marr deserves an apology\", before encouraging people make complaints to the Independent Press Standards Organisation.In a statement to the BBC, the Independent Press Standards Organisation said: \"we have received a total of 11 complaints about the article.\"All of the complaints are under Clause 12 (Discrimination), with one or two also citing Clause 1 (Accuracy) or Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock).\"It is IPSO policy not to comment on the identity of individual complainants, so I am unable to confirm the names of anyone who has contacted us on this article.\"Robert Peston's new ITV Sunday politics talk show had received lukewarm reviews following its debut this weekend.Letts reviewed Peston's programme as \"breathless and batty - and bound to be a hit\".",

Other local reports said the payout was about A$10m ($9.3m, Â£5.5m).\"She's very relieved to put the case behind her,\" he said, adding that even after the surgery she had already received, she still needed further treatment for her injuries.Ms Pitt would have faced several more years in court had she not settled, he added.\"It has been very stressful. She now looks forward to getting on with her life and starting a family with her partner Michael Hoskin,\" Mr Walsh added.",

It looked exactly like the edge of an ice shelf,\" the officer said.Researchers aboard the ship, HMNZS Canterbury, suggest that the source of the pumice was an underwater volcano (seamount) known as Monowai, located to the north of New Zealand.The pumice is likely to have been formed when lava from the seamount came into contact with seawater, and as it is less dense than water it quickly rises to the surface of the ocean.Vicky Hards from the British Geological Survey said the raft of volcanic rocks on this scale was a \"relatively unusual occurrence\".\"Some 50-60 volcanic eruptions are reported per year in total, and out of these only a very small proportion are submarine,\" she told BBC News.\"Nevertheless, submarine volcanic eruptions are a relatively common phenomena, in fact many probably go unrecorded in the deep marine environment.Dr Hards added that a previous example was close to Tristan da Cunha, a small group of small volcanic islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean.\"A small eruption occurred in 2004 and rafts of pumice were observed about a mile offshore, washing up on the beaches for the next weeks\" she explained.",

They then developed a climate model to work out what drove the extinction.The researchers think the rapid rate of release of carbon was a crucial factor in driving the ocean acidification.The carbon was released at a similar rate to modern emissions. Dr Clarkson commented: \"Scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time, but direct evidence has been lacking until now.\"This is a worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions.\"",

Many economists had expected it to shrink again and fall into recession.Over the whole year it has grown by 2.3%, helped by strong consumer spending and investment.But growth in agriculture was flat and industry shrank by 0.2% in the last quarter.The figures offer some support for President Dilma Rousseff as she tries to woo investors before she stands for re-election in October.The fact that there was a 6.3% jump in investment will help her persuade businesses that confidence is returning.The government has also promised to cut $18.5bn (Â£11.1bn) in public spending to bring its deficit under control.The Central Bank put interest rates up on Wednesday to 10.75% - the same level they were at when President Rousseff took office in 2011.Inflation has fallen back to 5.6% after peaking at 6.7% in June.The cutting of interest rates early on in her tenure helped growth but caused inflation and a fall in the currency. Since 2011 the Brazilian currency, the real, has fallen from 1.70 to the dollar to 2.35.The decline in Brazil's fortunes, the fall off in public services, continuing corruption and what is seen as excessive spending on the World Cup has brought protesters out on to the streets over the last year.The economy rode a commodity boom under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, growing on average 4%. In 2010, growth peaked at over 7%.But it became over-dependent on the Chinese market with exports to China growing at roughly four times the rate of total exports between 2000 and 2010.Chinese imports of soy, for example, represent over 40% of Brazil's exports.As Chinese demand fell away, Brazilian growth stuttered, weighed down by poor infrastructure, high consumer debt and sagging business confidence.",

But he was looking after his home, like everyone else\"She described him as a man's man with plenty of friends who liked dog racing.Mrs Watt said it had been incredibly hard to give evidence at the inquest into her husband's death.\"You learn to live with it,\" she said. \"Everyone has their problems.\"The first inquest into his death was held in July 1971 and resulted in an open verdict.The latest inquest was ordered in 2012 by Attorney General John Larkin QC - one of a number of controversial Troubles killings by the security forces which are being re-examined.Counsel for the coroner told the court there had been difficulties in tracing and identifying soldiers involved in the case.In February, the Ministry of Defence defended a Parachute Regiment Facebook appeal asking former soldiers for information about Mr Watt's killing.But Mrs Watt told the BBC she was \"not out for vengeance\".\"Let them run on,\" she added. \"They'll face their own maker yet.\"Ten months after her husband was killed, Mrs Watt's brother Joe was also killed by the Army and an inquest into his death is due to take place later this year.",

This is almost as many as the UK (30), France (27) and Germany (23) combined.The full list will be published on Monday at a conference in Leipzig, Germany.The top500 list is a widely-recognised barometer of the state of worldwide supercomputing. It has been published twice yearly since 1993.All the computers are measured against the same criteria - a benchmark first devised in 1979 but since improved as computing has become ever more sophisticated.Such is the immense power of the supercomputers, their computational ability is measured in petaflop/s - quadrillions of calculations per second.The top performing computer, Tianhe-2, had its power measured at 33.86 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second). It has been just five years since IBM's Roadrunner became the first computer to break the 1 petaflop/s mark. That machine was shut down in 2013 due to excessive power consumption.The entire top 500 list of supercomputers combined offered 274 petaflop/s.Tianhe-2 is owned by the Chinese government and operated by the National University of Defence Technology.

Some said they could not be bothered, while others were afraid of intimidation or embarrassed.A new guide to help students avoid being overcharged contains tips on how to take a meter reading, shopping around to get the best utility deals,  querying high bills and how to report faults, keep records of conversations and complain.Broadband packages are another minefield, says the guide, so students are advised to check the length of contracts, whether they are transferable, and to be aware of any limits on the amount of data they can download - even with so-called \"unlimited\" deals.To avoid losing deposits for damage caused by previous tenants, they are advised to check tenancy agreements and take inventories and photographs when they first move in.\"We want to ensure that all students are able to stand up for their rights and speak out when things go wrong, whether that is being asked to pay for a bill from a previous tenant or paying for damage they did not do,\" said Mr Shand Smith.\"Students should not be losing money, simply because they don't know their rights or are not making a fuss.\"",

One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so.

Critics say that, as the system operator, National Grid could prioritise sourcing electricity via these cables rather than from other sources of generation.Pointing to the situation in the United States, the then chairman of the committee, Angus MacNeil, stated that: \"The Independent System Operator model has worked in the USA. It is time for it to be brought to these shores.\"But National Grid's chief executive, John Pettigrew, had argued against a break-up, saying that he was not convinced that creating a separate system operator would be beneficial to customers.The company had also warned of the potential disruption to the energy sector and the risks to security of supply that a break-up could bring.",

Series producer Dominic Minghella said that viewers can expect a \"darker tone\" in the upcoming episodes. The Musketeers has proven very popular with audiences since it first aired in 2014. However, Minghella felt that the show needed to evolve to stay engaging for fans. He stated that the lighter adventures of the first two seasons worked well but that it was time for some \"grittier storylines\".The producer said that the bond between the four iconic musketeers of Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan will be tested as they face more serious threats than ever before. Enemy forces are also going to become more formidable and devious in their schemes to undermine the Musketeers and the country. Cast members including Luke Pasqualino, Howard Charles, and Santiago Cabrera said that they relished the chance to sink their teeth into meatier dramatic material. Pasqualino, who plays D'Artagnan, called it an \"acting challenge\" to portray the darker elements that their characters will struggle with this year.New cast additions have also been announced, including some villainous roles that will clash violently with the Musketeers. Filming for the drama's third season has been taking place on location in Prague, Bruges and North Yorkshire to depict the elaborately costumed world of 17th century France. The darker reimagining is hoped to keep audiences on the edge of their seats through intense action sequences and personal conflicts for the beloved characters. The new episodes are scheduled to air on BBC One later this year. Fans are eagerly awaiting to see how the hit show evolves its tone while staying true to its roots.",

At the new inquest this week, the pathologist said there was no evidence Mr Watt had been thrown into the air by an explosion as a soldier had claimed. Mr Watt's widow welcomed the findings, saying she was pleased the truth has finally come out after decades of uncertainty. She said it gave her family closure to know her husband was innocent and that his name has now been cleared of any wrongdoing. The legal process has been a long fight for justice but the widow feels vindicated by the conclusions of the new inquest.",

By asserting Taiwanese sovereignty over the largest island feature in the disputed Spratly archipelago, Ma appears determined to take a strong stance on Taiwan's territorial claims despite Beijing's objections. The visit comes as China has ramped up its military and civilian presence across the South China Sea in recent years, fueling distrust between Taiwan and its giant neighbor who both lay historic claims over the lucrative fishing waters and potential energy resources in the area. Analysts warn that Ma's trip risks provoking an angry response from China, who may view it as a provocative step to undermine its expansive nine-dash line claim over most of the South China Sea, further straining already delicate cross-strait relations. International observers will be closely watching how the geopolitical trip unfolds amid the fragile stability in the contested waters.",

According to a statement issued by the North Devon Healthcare Trust, the organization's leadership made the difficult decision to shut down general medical beds at Ilfracombe and Bideford hospitals due to budgetary constraints severely limiting their ability to properly maintain and staff the aging wards. Patients previously served by the now-shuttered beds will be referred to the remaining facilities at Barnstaple's North Devon District Hospital, though family members of patients voiced concerns over the increased distances and transportation troubles that could result from the consolidations. Local politicians have branded the closure a \"tragic failure\" of the Trust to appropriately fund services throughout the rural northwest stretch of the county and meet the needs of its growing elderly population. Campaigners are circulating petitions demanding reconsideration of the plan, which they claim will undermine the essential healthcare infrastructure in some of Devon's most remote villages and towns situated along its rugged northern coastline. Only time will tell if the orchestrated community response can persuade decision makers to reverse or alter the fateful changes to hospital access across the isolated top reaches of Devon.",

Lead researcher Dr. Ian Speirs noted that when whiskey molecules come into contact with water, they undergo a process known as sublimation and deposition. This causes certain aroma compounds soluble in alcohol to shift out of solution and interact with the nasal receptors, enhancing the drinker's perception of flavors like honey, oak and vanilla notes. \"Using chromatography and spectroscopy analysis, we were able to track specific aroma molecules as they moved from the alcoholic solution into the gas phase upon initial water dilution,\" explained Dr. Speirs. Their findings, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, showedlowering the ethanol concentrationallowed fuller appreciation of the more subtle esters and acids that impart the distinguishing tastes in Scotch, bourbon and rye. With this new understanding of whisky's chemistry, Dr. Speirs hopes bartenders and connoisseurs alike can further optimize their blending techniques to let the liquid's natural complexities shine through.",

But I believe that using modern technology, we can spread the story further.\" She spent one afternoon recently and recorded some of the most popular stories in the Mabinography series, such as Dyfed's Pwyll Lord, Llyr's Branwen daughter, and Llyr's Manawydan son. Then, Morgan uploaded the audio files of her reading to the popular podcast platform, and within a few days, they were listened to dozens of. With the encouragement of early interests, she is now working hard to completely record all 11 stories in the series and release it with the plot. If you succeed, Morgan hopes that Asia, the United States and future audiences can discover these ancient Wales stories for the first time. Morgan pointed out: \"These folk stories have always brought me happiness, and I am glad to share with anyone from all over the world.\" Her ancestors were almost unimaginable new audiences when they started translating works 150 years ago.",

Gatland, who has led Wales spectacularly for over a decade since 2008, guided the team to an unprecedented four Six Nations titles during his tenure. After thoughtful consideration, the vastly experienced Gatland feels that after 12 successful years at the helm, Wales will benefit from a fresh perspective following the next World Cup. The upcoming global showcase in Japan will be Gatland's swansong leading Wales on rugby's greatest stage. Welsh Rugby Union officials expressed heartfelt gratitude to Gatland for his outstanding leadership and stewardship of the team throughout multiple glory-filled campaigns. Wales now eagerly awaits the 2019 World Cup as supporters hope Gatland can cap off his Welsh reign with a euphoric tournament victory before moving on. The search will promptly commence for Gatland's high-profile replacement to drive Wales forward into the next qualifying cycle towards 2023.",

Video footage from the Hannover rally showed Steinbrueck, a former finance minister, extending his middle finger below the podium as he addressed photographers.

Steinbrueck later acknowledged his regrettable mistake in a statement, apologizing for the \"thoughtless action.\" Polls had showed the chancellor race tightening before September's federal election, but analysts believe the gaffe may damage Steinbrueck's image in the eyes of undecided voters and boost support for Merkel's bid for a third term. As Steinbrueck works to move past the distraction, the incident highlights how modern politics subjects all candidates to intense scrutiny, as anything captured on video can spread instantly online.

Stephen Mold was elected as PCC last year and established tԝo deputy positions to assist him. Hoԝever, the Lib Dems claim he has filled these roles with \"party political activists\" rather than personas with experience in policing. Group leader Chris Stanba said the appointments raise questions about the commissioner's priorities. \"It appears the criteria for these roles was simply being a Conservative Party meｍber, not any qualifications or track record in cut crime,\" Stanbra said. Du deputies, Alex Winter and Adam Simmonds, both have backgrounds in politics but no documented careers in law enforcement. Mold has defended the choices, saying the deputies were chose based on their abilities, not their party affiliations. \"Both Alex and Adam have a affluence of experience that will help me delivеr for the people of Northamptonshire,\" Mold commented. However, critics argue experience in policing should have been an essentiaⅼ requirement. Northamptonshire Police Federatiоn chair Brian Austin voiced his uncertainty over the appointments. \"Of course we are keeping an open mind, but it's concerning to see a lack of policing experience at seni or levels of the PCC's office,\" Austin said. Statistics so far this year show overall crime in Northamptonshire has remained lеvel compared to 2021. The argument over the deputy PCC roles has exacerbated existing tensions between the county's political platoons. Mold dismissed the complaints as unfounded politicɑl point-scoring. But Stanbra insisted it was a matter of public interеst to scrutinize how such important decisions are made.

Me a failure, because it was n' t working. It was true. I could make some sparks, but nothing the way they wanted. I was n' t an anti-tech bomb. I just wanted to die. Everything about me was a failure. I let them shoot my arm and felt the blackness overtake me. I died. And then i woke up. just as they were zipping up the body bag, I sat up and screamed. And every piece of electronics screamed with me. The flourescent bulbs flared a blinding light and exploded, the pagers, the recording equipment were obliterated. And I realized. Who were they to label me a failure? And I realized something far greater. Brains are the greatest pieces of electronic equipment in the world. They fry just as easily. I placed a hand on one of them and his arm started spasming as the neuron pathways fired simultaneously and he collapsed, with every synapse in his body and head cooked to a golden perfection. It' s not just touch, I found on the next. He fell without coming within five feet of me. The final one had static blasting from his legs into the ground and I could smell fried pork. The electronicly-locked door happily opened when I asked it to, and everything in path smoldered. I had suffered and died for them and their idea, and they called me a failure.

I' ve lived a long life of being down on my luck. I have no home, no kids, no friends, no family, nothing. I was born into this world without any real care or responsibilities. I was bullied all the time, and shoved aside for those who can buy happiness. One day I decided to change that. The first one was for Phantom of the Opera. I broke the Prima Donna' s leg. It was easy. I set up the chandelier to fall on top of her during rehearsal. No one expected a thing. It collapsed right on top of her just like I planned.

Otherwise the \" single action, make peace \" line was kind of clunky, it may have worked better to have Fletcher explain what single action meant earlier on so that it was in the readers head towards the end. In the final conversation Conall probably talked a little bit too much. There seemed to be lines that did n' t really seem like things he would say and were more there to set up Colm. Other than that there were a couple minor things. There' s that darkly comedic line towards the end where you could probably drop \" do you think? \" and there were a couple of similes and metaphors that came off as awkward to me, for example \" the chastised face of a small child caught pilfering cookies from a jar \" or \" it felt sour and sugary, like lemon in a glass of water \", but I' m pretty much allergic to similes that are n' t played for humour so I' d especially take that with a grain, or shaker, of salt.

I had never been this popular before and I was willing to do almost anything for it to stay that way. \" What' s it about? \" Jim asked without looking away from his disassembled Colt. \" I, uh... \" I swallowed hard and felt my face go red. \" Damn it, just spit it out Berry. \" \" I never lost my killginity Jim. I never killed anyone. \" Jim stopped polishing his gun and looked up. He had a surprised look on his face. \" Shit man I' m so sorry. Why not? \" I did n' t know what to say. Why had n' t I ever killed anyone? I guess I just could n' t bring myself to do it. Every time I had been close I just started shaking uncontrollably and start retching. \" I do n' t know man, I just... I just have n' t. \" I paused for a few seconds before I could bring myself to ask him. \" You owe me one, remember. \" He stood up and looked me in the face, he looked half disgusted and half pitying. \" Yeah okay, what do you want me to do? \" \" Well I was thinking that... maybe I could kill you? \" The pity and disgust turned into pure annoyance. He rolled his eyes and let out a long sigh. \" Fine, just let me put my Colt together.",

I am not a spiritual person, I believe only in fact, and yet, there is the vision of that room. The feeling it gave me, the idea that perfect, incandescent happiness could be mere normalcy, pushed its way into my heart like an invasion of hope. That place housed people I love, people who will never meet, separated as they are by life and death, and those people were just talking. Even in my dream, I dared not interject for fear that my reliance on the reality of my life would spoil that moment, that possibility. And so I just watched, and they talked, sitting on furniture of sunlight, and surrounded by sunlight as they discussed things and laughed on occasion. I am not sure if the happiness of that place came from my own heart, or if that happiness had infected me from some external source, but it was everywhere, so beautifully inescapable. I am scared to call it heaven, and even more terrified to call it just a dream. Inevitably, it has planted itself in my heart, and my desire to see it again has shifted something in me. I will not say I believe in this, but I can not help but want to.",

Rumors had spread that he had even built devices to enhance his powers, one such device took up an entire room and with it he could easily expand his powers across the entire globe if he concentrated hard enough. He was as nefariously smart as he was lethal. This scoundrel didn' t even hide. Everyone in authority knew where he lived. He even had his name in bronze on the entrance gates to one of the largest properties in Westchester County. What made him difficult to get to was he surrounded himself with children.

That is why I was built: to remember the lost, to keep their memory alive, and to grant them true immortality. My creators knew that no physical object could withstand the ebb and flow of time, so they built me to exist beyond this realm. They knew that their effort were pointless without anyone to appreciate their memory, so I was given thought. And so I was born. They called me an ark: a vessel to house their collected experiences, knowledge, memories, hopes, and dreams; I would remember them long after their people, their cities, their worlds had turned to dust. And so I did. For eons, I remembered them: I remembered all of their first steps, their first loves, their first heartbreaks, so on and so forth. Eventually, I can not say when, I became them: their first steps became mine, I shared their first loves and their heartbreaks, and on and on; my creator' s aspirations were now borne unto me. I looked on at my new dreams and memories and found something I did not anticipate: jealousy. Even though I shared their memories, I could never truly accept them as my own; *I* was not the one to kiss Melanie on the last day of high school, *I* was not the one who married Stephen against my parents' best wishes, *I* was not the one who made that perfect cake for Gramma Ly on her 75^th birthday, *I* was not the one who lived a life with ups and downs and twists and turns & mdash; *I* am merely a spectator in these events.

Nothing but clumped frozen mud mixed with the earthen smell of being stuck made him feel worse. Only a few days of snow had managed to make its way down to cover his tracks. What was worse than the abundance of rain was the lack of enemy movement. There had scarcely been an opportunity to do any reconnaissance on the command unit near the middle of the division. The come of weather had slowed their mechanised units down more than the freezing winds of winter. Their supply train was slow, guarded but still vulnerable. As long as they kept moving and held their commander' s beacon, they would still be defended from orbital bombardment. Luckily for Trajan, his was trained for such a task. Today, he had the cover of a swamp that the enemy scout squadrons had overlooked. The impassable marsh lingered, and they did n' t want to be bogged down by unnecessary information. As the sun shined through the trees with a brilliant beam, he saw an opportunity. The Commander and his aides were surveying the edge of the forest. His vanguard to the rear had begun pitching the command tent and the body guards were off to the side on latrine duty. Trajan lifted the rifle, a heavy thing in the steadiest of hands.

No, today I' m going to do something *good*, something *cultural* and most of all something *smart*. /r/books began to load. As I began reading the front page to get a gist of the subreddit I could not handle it. They were so damn pretentious. Nobody loves reading this much. At least, I hope not. I thought of something a little bit more up my ally. Somewhere where I could feel smart, but do n' t actually have to do *boring* things. Thus, I came to /r/writingprompts. It was amazing. I could get *other* people to do *work* for *free*. I just had to think of a good idea, and I' m chock full of them. I could not think of anything, *anything*. I smiled. I' m a genius. My writing prompt, will be a prompt telling them how they felt while writing a writing prompt. *Now all I have to do is wait for that sweet, sweet karma. *",

        "text": "To: United Nations Committee for the Culling of the Human Population From: [ Malkalack ] Subject: Re: Population Problems Saying \" we have an overpopulation problem \" at this stage would be somewhat of an understatement. The Earth simply can not withstand the current population of 11, 000, 000, 000 souls. The taxation on the environment is outrageous. The ladies and gentlemen of this committee have asked me for a solution; in this message is the solution. How does one go about eradicating the human race? We' re certainly too advanced for a disease to make any sort of a dent in the population. If we were to simply begin culling people by force, a war may ensue - one that would n' t leave two stones standing on top of each other. Other methods are simply too unreliable or inexpensive - nanobots and killer AI come to mind. Albert Einstein once said, \" Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I' m not sure about the former. \" and this rings true. The truth is, most human beings are stupid. We can educate ourselves, but, as another saying goes, \" you ca n' t fix stupid \".... Which is the crux of my position. If we remove the warning signs from hazardous pieces of equipment and machinery, people will die in droves. The amount of fools slicing their own arteries with lawn-mowers, and falling from construction cranes will greatly decrease our population. Without safety warnings or manuals, society degrades. Thank you kindly for considering my proposal.",

These are the types of cases I handle. Death said she has seen far to many of these over the millennia, constantly chipping away at her each time, slowly desensitizing her, leaving the cold reach of Death so widely known today. But for these she wanted a soft touch. She wanted those who have met a violent or \" tragic \" end to not have a rude transition with the harsh and now cold pull of Death but rather with a warm embrace. Someone to gently hug someone who had just lost everything, a friendly present to gently nudge them towards the after life. A kind face to sooth the minds of scared children instead of the hollow eyes, and the pale and drawn mask of Death. She wanted someone who knows what it' s like to live. What it' s like to laugh, to feel crushing guilt, to fall hopelessly in love, feel fear strong enough to lock you in place hoping you die on the spot, to obsess over something for hours on end, and someone who knows what it feels like to lose every thing; hope, freedom, everything.

He had put on this suit and tie for a reason, and he was n' t going to leave until he' d given the CEO of Disney what he deserved. Jack kind of felt sorry for the man. He had no idea what was about to happen. However, Jack was the Chosen One, and he had a responsibility to the world. When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white. Suddenly, the CEO was transfixed on Jack' s hands. Inside the CEO' s mind was pure madness. He saw his wife and kids burning, in the ruins of his childhood home. He could n' t hold back his tears. One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse. And his friends were crying... no, not crying. *Laughing. * He fell to his knees and wept. In the real world, however, nothing was to be seen but a grown man, leader of a company, sobbing uncontrollably for no reason. Jack decided to be creative this time. He made the illusion of Mickey mouse ears appear on each and every employee' s head. They were grafted on of course, and felt just like they were really there. The CEO was in for a nice surprise when he woke up. Jack used his powers to erase the minds of the executives around him, replacing thoughts of expenses and profits with the single-minded desire to give the CEO a hug. Jack giggled, not having to stifle his laughter anymore. He levitated out th window, crossing a name off his list. Jack was the Chosen One. His powers were unstoppable. He could be whatever he wanted. Obviously, whoever was doing the choosing made a mistake. That was clear to Jack, at least. Life was a role-playing game to him.

He will take you out of the Greater Sherando Area. You' ll be able to meet up with some of your cousins. Play nice with them, as your shared experiences and heritage are all that you have with each other. In an ever-changing world, you will only have each other to anchor you down. Bad men and women have taken over this country, and they hate people like us. They have convinced many of our friends to turn on us for who we are. Our sole crime: being Calabrese. In Rodenas Square, innocent Calebreseians are being cruelly hurt by a group of Lapumas. This country is not the country that you know. This is not the country that I knew when I was young. It has changed for the worse, and our welcome has been determined to be overstayed. Maybe one day, when all of this is over, things can return back to normal. Lapumas and Calebresians can one day live together in peace again and you will be able to play with little Sammy again. But until that day comes, you must stay strong. You must look out for yourself, and your cousins, and other Calebresians. I do n' t expect you to understand any of this. This world is very harsh and unforgiving. But remember that I will always love you and I am proud of how tough you are. Your father, your mother, and I will always be watching over you. You are our sweet sunshine and no one can take that away from you. Your loving uncle, Milan Cutro PS: If you can, avoid Campbell Hollow.

The planet was warm, some 4 degrees C warmer than humans are used to. The aliens landed their ground forces in preparation for harvesting another world, providing raw resources for a galactic empire of a million worlds. This act would cause another mass extinction of the species of Earth. Indeed the ancestors of these aliens had been to this planet several times before, each time wiping out most of the planet' s life as they extracted key resources. But each time the planet and its ecological diversity would heal. But this time, this time things were different. There was a new species unlike any which had inhabited the planet before. A predator, which had dominion over all other animals. It would put up the greatest resistance the aliens ever faced, and after this battle the aliens would never return. The war was long and bloody and in the end the aliens in their stubborn determination eradicated the entire species and any other like it but at an enormous cost. The belligerent, the Galactic Alien Empire of Hovering Squid World 97a; the defenders the Tyrannosaurus Rex of Earth; casualties: 500, 000, 000 alien soldiers, and complete eradication of the Earth reptilian threat 65 million years ago. tl; dr [ In the end it was not humans which defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all god' s creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex ] ( https: //www. youtube. com/watch? v=qxln3a7GyfI ).",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated.

Both of them lived alone, which Bruce decided was a good first talking point. They spoke for a while, about living alone, about being lonely, about their parents. Bruce had the bright idea, at the end of the date, to suggest they head back to his place for, as he called it,' netflix and chill'. The girl, who he found out was named Lilly, gave a look of indignation, but only for a moment. She grinned and offered a counter-suggestion- head to her place and' water her plants'. Bruce grinned and helped her out to his car. The two arrived at her place. She had been quiet the drive back- another clue Bruce should have been aware of- but he was too excited about the upcoming activities. She asked him if he was thirsty- he said yes. She headed in to the kitchen, and Bruce heard her mutter something. He dismissed it, and she came out with a clear blue liquid, very much like the color of blue kool-aid. He accepted it graciously and drank it all at once, then asked where the plants were that needed watering. She responded it was coming in soon.

The important corner. Oddly enough, there was no date on it, he had all the time in the world to review the contents of the folder. He watched the elves scurry around, making sure everything was in order post-Christmas trip. Eventually, when they were confident that nothing horrible had happened in the twelve hours Santa was not around, they all said goodbye and went to take a well-deserved break. Santa' s hand lazily reached out to the folder, bringing it close enough to leaf through the paper. Once opened, a picture of a teenager was taped to the paper, titled' Justin'. The format sent a shiver through him. This was no doubt an application to become a Gifter. He had n' t seen one in two hundred years easily, and the last accepted one was well over two thousand years ago, when Buddha applied after dying to become a Gifter of Knowledge. He flipped the page, and a hand-written note was the only thing remaining before the back end of the folder.' Dear Gifters, I' m Nick. I died of cancer at the age of 17. My only regret is that I never had enough time in my life to do things, and I wanted to make sure that nobody in the future would ever have that issue. The Council told me to apply to be a Gifter, and since you were the original, I sent it to you, St Nicholas. I was told you have the ability to read minds ( which makes the jingle so much more understandable! ) so I' m sure that you can just go through my thoughts and memories, so I kept this short. You' re surely tired after your trip. In short, I want to be the Nick of time. Thanks Justin' Santa chuckled, grinning. If there was ever an application that made sense, this was one of them.",

The entire world came together as we built the first ships and colonized the moon.

Building on their technology we became masters of stealth, perfecting ships that their most advanced sensor technology could not detect. Our first forays out of the buffer zone was in sending our stealthiest craft to capture nearby vessels, pulling them into the buffer zones like high tech trapdoor spiders. These pirated vessels were stripped and studied, their stunned crews interrogated. We learned their latest tech while we colonized every star system we could within the buffer. We used the resources to build an armada and spent the next decade training the best navy the galaxy had ever seen. Today, I stand on the bridge of the lead ship as admiral of the Terran Fleet.

The gas was off, the oven was off, there was nothing cooking in the microwave, the door was locked and bolted, the ceiling sounded steady. Its been four minutes since the pain started and I couldnt find the source of it. I began to cry silently, more in fear of what was to happen than the pain itself.

It' s a bit too complex to write in a short story, but the general gist is this: Long ago, the Gamemakers planted the seeds of civilization on a faraway planet, known as Aendra. It was an island world, and on each of these islands, a race of men were left to develop. Some were strong, some were clever, some small. Each race was based on a single founder: their traits and attributes, and ways of thinking are exaggerated versions of a single template. Each of these races would be allowed to develop in isolation for 1000 years, being kept within 200 miles of their shores by a mysterious force. At the end of these 1000 years, the barriers are lifted and the different societies are allowed to interact. Among the most successful races are the Sierrans: a race of enormous, red-headed warriors, masters of ironcraft, and ravenously imperialistic, with an insatiable desire to conquer; the Endaryans: a race of agile, but diminutive peoples, who fight by cover of darkness. Having been driven into caves and underground tunnels early in their existence by an environmental anomaly, they pose a stark contrast to the Sierrans, and later become their main opponent. Finally, the Haelans: a race of average build and exceptional brilliance. The Haelans are devoted to the goal of self-improvement, through learning, augmentation, and eugenics. By the time the barriers were lifted, Sierran society had evolved into a warrior cult, bent on glory. Endaryans had become honor-bound thieves and assassins. Haelans had developed orbital flight, and being on a small, rocky island, did not have the numbers to withstand nearby races, even with their advanced technology. The Haelans abandoned their island and became space-faring, the Sierrans took over most of the world, and the Endaryans put up stout resistance, wherever their tunnels and bunkers had been dug. And then the story starts.",

Other large cities started to follow - no murders for week. For a month. For months. Were the cops no longer working? Reporters and civilians spent nights doing ride-alongs with cops, to verify and discover what the police had seen all along. People were dying, but they were dying of other causes. There were no knife marks, no bullet wounds, no bruises from force, no poisons introduced. There were no homicides. People disappeared though. It' s not many people who want to kill others, so it took a while to figure out what was going on. Street gangs eventually disappeared. Abusive spouses disappeared. Those were the first you' d notice. Then it became more subtle. Some people you would just never see again. No one knew who took them or why, but we all figured they were someone who would want to murder. So it' s now just us. The one' s who are left. We all realize that the ones taken were angrier. Some say they were more passionate and more feeling, and really the only ones left are the ones that are easiest to control, because we' ll never fight against anything.

It must have been hours before he came too, the cold air chilling his spine as the sun disappeared behind the horizon. The beach was empty. He was alone. Again. He swept the sand from his skin as he stood and then felt something fall at his feet. A single daisy with a long stem. He looked around again. There was no one but himself left on the beach and he could n' t see where the flower had come from. He twirled it in his hands a few times before balling it up and placing it in his pocket as he walked back towards his car.",

In this future, things look hella cool, like all metal with shiny silver stuff on it, and sometimes they shoot fire. But things are also dark and gritty, because people ca n' t skateboard or play videogames because the Government says they ca n' t. THEN JESUS COMES JUMPING OFF THE ROOF. He is hella built, with muscles and stuff like Macho Man Randy Savage. There is a future helicopter that is shooting at him. Jesus hits it with his battle cross. The battle cross is like the normal cross except it' s hella big and black and covered with spikes and shit. The helicopter assplodes and everyone down on the ground is looking up and they see jesus up there and they are like **hell yeah man that is hella metal man! ** Then jesus plays a judas priest song and the government gets mad because Judas priest is hella rad and might make then get revolution-ed. So they send their ninja assassin IRS tax dudes to come and kill jesus. For a minute it looks like Jesus is gon na die but THEN he uses his magic heavenzord powers and God sends down the robotic fist of justice to smite the ninjas. It is like a giant robot, and it has a robot beard and also a battle cross that shoots lasers. But then the ninjas pray to satan and satan sends a robot too, but this one is hella metal, it is all black and on fire, and when it steps on the ground it causes hella big earthquakes and people die. Then the robots fight, and they destroy the future past world. When jesus wins he goes up to heaven and lives happily every after, and people still pray to him now.",

Light wavered at the center of my vision, distorting my perception of the blue hospital bed fabric. Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall. The light pulled away, disappearing along with my vision as I felt the last pulsations of my heart dwindle into nothing. Darkness enveloped my hapless soul.",

Stories about mischievous cats, high school dramas, and ancient civilizations quickly sprung up all over the place.

The next day featured more of the same prompts. Outwardly, the writers were elated, but more and more stories began to drift into familiar realms. A prompt based on an Einstein quote regarding time relativity was the most obvious, receiving 300 upvotes and 40 stories involving time travel, and spaceships. By day 5, every story involved some mention of Hitler, immortality or Gods. By the time Monday rolled around, the mods decided to close the subreddit.

The African Union has been threatening the Strait since Spain captured Isla de Alborán as a naval base with the backing of NATO in direct violation of the Treaty Of Tangier. The Soviet Union has been working with the U. N. as an arbitrator between the European Powers and the A.

The U. N. also hopes to resolve the fate of the stateless Boer people who were expelled out of Africa along with other European peoples from Zimbabwe and Algeria after the introduction of Cairo Accord which stripped citizenship and expelled ancestors of European colonists still living on the Continent. Currently no nation has agreed to take in ten thousand displaced people who currently reside in displaced persons camps in Brazil who have made moves to close the camps and move the people on stating \" we believe we have no responsibility to these people and that the nations that placed their ancestors in Africa should repatriate them \".

The feeling had consumed most of his arms and legs and had begun to encompass his head. As it delved deeper, he got progressively duller.

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

Well turns out the rumors were true for the most part, but not because it was the spear head that pirced Jesus, no this one was the spear that killed him. As it happens whenever someone who has a particularly strong spirit, usually world leaders or creators of great movements, is killed they imprint a fraction of themselves on the item that did them in. The gun that killed Hitler causes​ someone to be poisoned to death when shot with it, the cup that Rasputin drank from will give the holder an immunity to death. Now, whenever one of these items turns up it is our job to hunt them down before they can start causing a problem. We work independently from the control of any government, but funded by every single one of them.

My friends told me about this girl that would be just perfect for me, and since that we both have n' t found our soul-mates yet, I gave into the pressure and called her for date. She said yes of course About a week later I went on a date with her, then I saw one of the prettiest girls I had seen in my live. I had a great time and she was a wonderful woman, but I had this feeling that this is n' t the one. I just did n' t click with her. But I just thought that everyone had this at first and when I really get to know her, it will come. We went on more and more dates, but I kept feeling it. But since she seemed to have a great time and did seemed to love me, I just thought it was me, and the love for her will come. After a year of dating I got pressured by my friends to ask her to marry me. Since all my friends where married within the year, and did n' t get why it would take me so long. I ask her, since I already date her for so long, and who else was I going to marry? I kept telling myself you will love her when you two are married. There is something magical about getting married, and then everything will be fine. I lived a normal live, made a family. Got a girl and a boy. Worked at a job, while my wife stayed home taking care of the kids and what not. But still I did not love my wife. I kept wondering is there something wrong with me? Did I do something wrong? Is there someone else I was suppose to marry? Year later, my wife died at age 83. My kids now got families of their own. But the sad thing is I never loved my wife, I am not sure if I am the only one on earth or that I' d married the wrong woman and that she also married the wrong man. But I ca n' t stop feeling like I did something wrong in my life. My first attempt in this sub, not sure if its any good, but I hope you enjoy it. also I apologize if there are grammar mistakes.

Every night for the past few years he dreamt of this place, and every night he woke as he reached the cool shade of the apple tree. Tonight, however, he was allowed to touch the tree. He felt the rough bark, and could smell the apples that littered its branches. He reached up to grab one of the apples, to finally taste one of them when he heard a voice. \" I would n' t do that if I was you. \" Adam spun around. He had never encountered another person in the garden before. When he saw her, his jaw dropped. She was very obviously full human. She was of medium height, with long dark hair and green eyes. She approached with a steady confidence that made Adam uneasy. She reached out to pull his hand away from the tree, and as soon as her smooth skin brushed against his, Adam woke. He found himself completely nude in a patch of trees that he had never seen before. He slowly got up and started exploring, trying to figure out where he was. A fallen tree was blocking the path, and as he climbed over it he gasped. The tree from his dream was right in front of him. He wandered closer, and as he approached, he could make out a figure sitting in the shade of the tree. It was the woman. She looked up. \" Welcome to the Garden of Eden. My name is Eve.

The people would now be willing, if not eager, to give up their hard-won freedoms in exchange for safety and security. It was, as the saying goes, the beginning of the end. We have all sacrificed more than we would wish. We have all lost family members in the struggle for freedom. We have lost our homes. We have lost our jobs. We have lost our entire way of life. Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III. During an evacuation attempt by his bodyguards from the besieged White House, he was shot and killed by U.S. Military forces. His crime was suspicion of advocating freedom. \" My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my people. \" This is Radio Free America, signing off.",

Everyone lets loose and something deep down lets all their cares go and allows them to truly feel what i feel. I was on to my last song of the night when suddenly in the back of the crowd you could see everyone slowly stop dancing one by one. It was as if everyone were goats, you know those goats where they get scared and just stand there. Something was making them do this. People shifted from enjoying themselves to staring at each other and thinking negatively. There was a lady in the back who was clapping her hands and it seemed like the louder and longer she clapped the more people stopped dancing. This continued until every single person in the crowd was just standing here and whispering to each. Who was this lady? Why was she doing this? Slowly she came through the parting crowd and reached her hand out to me. \" Hello, my name is Judgment \" she uttered.",

And that was how he was able to talk to me. As he lay dying, he told me it was up to me to save my planet, as he was now unable to complete his mission. All I needed was to tell him what I needed to fight of the impending intergalactic threat until more of his people could arrive to save us. I knew what I needed, and it was almost too perfect as I saw myself soaring through the clouds, fighting incredible battles and saving all the people below. I was going to be a hero. I was going to be famous. I was going to get laid! It must have been my rush to get the words out. Or, perhaps, Mr. Wish-alien did n' t pick the right accent when he learned English. But, 2 days later, as the alien force was entering the Earths atmosphere, I put my powers to work, hoping to steer the aliens away. I hoofed it up to the ship to engage the enemy. All I could see was red as I began the fight. I keep chewing on it over and over again in my mind, how could that stupid alien dooo this to me? Somehow, I was able to drive them back until help arrived. I was branded a hero! And as the aliens arrived on the capital to meet with the president and myself, the leader wished to be able to talk to us. Their leader asked me how such an earth creature as myself was able to save the planet.' Look' I said' I just wanted to be able to fly.'",

I' m not even sure if there can be a real ending, not until The End, when entropy has won.

We were the universe, and while the actual matter that composed us could never be destroyed, I did not understand what would happen to our knowledge. That' s what stopped me. Matter... it is conserved, along with energy. But knowledge... knowledge is never conserved. It might not be infinite, but it is never conserved. Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor.

As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA. My hope is that one day an intelligent civilization will recover one of those probes, discover our accomplishments, and return the human race to life. Until then, farewell.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites.

She knew that she could not return home empty-handed. She could not take another slap, not tonight. Not on New Years Eve. In the snow she found a blue lighter. The button pressed down and a small fire ignited in front of her eyes. In the fire she saw her family together around the tree on Christmas eve, laughing and hugging without a care in the world. The fire went out. In the next flame she saw her room. It was not big, but it was hers, she had ponies on the wall paper. The fire went out. The third flame, she saw her grandmother. The only person who had ever treated her nicely. The girl remembered her grandmother telling her about when a star shots across the heavens, it means a person has died and gone to heaven. She knew her grandmother was in heaven. She wished that she could see her again. The fire went out. The girl looked up at the night sky and just as she was about to close her eyes she saw a shooting star. She smiled. The fire went out.... The next day a man found the frozen body of a 9 year old girl. In her hand, a blue lighter.",

You: a long time ago in 2016, a scientist successfully made a perfect human clone in a lab. That' s us right daddy! Your son says smiling. Yes, but wait. So the clone learns 100x faster, and lives forever, by using tools he makes. He decides that the old humans are worthless, and decides to kill them all to repopulate us! Yea! The bad guys lose! Well they were n' t really bad guys son, we where. Really? Well yea, you ca n' t just kill someone because you do n' t like them can you? Nooooo you son says sadly. Exactly. So after 1, 000, 000 clones made. He launches his war. It was a bloodbath, and the clones retreated. But the world was a mess, and a few more years they fought again, until the clones life span finally caught up with them, and the last human named mada died in 1, 215. That' s a sad story is n' t it dad, it truly is son. Then why did he kill them all dad? Just because he made us a perfect human, does n' t mean he are n' t human son. What is it mean to be human daddy? It used to be used as a saying that we are n' t perfect. We make mistakes. Ironically being human lead to their death. Are we gods daddy? Without sheep, we are merely lions son.",

Mother ran the restaurant like no other and father fought for our freedom. They taught me well but they were n' t around most of the time. It hurt a lot. I remember the last time I felt their embrace being ten years ago. I grew up with semi-supportive parents. I understood why they worked so hard and I love them for that, however, I was taken aback by all the loneliness and vowed to never let my child feel this way. I would smother him/her with all the hugs and kisses I could. I married a lovely woman who was pregnant with my child. We currently reside in the hospital to await the birth of our baby. She asked me to get her phone from the car and I did so. Another car came speeding down the lane and hit me real hard. I woke up in a gurney next to my wife. She cradled the precious thing in her arms while sobbing gently. I tried to reach over to her but I could n' t manage. I wanted to hold my loved ones, show them that I cared. Then I noticed my right arm missing. My left arm was a 7 inch stump. I let a tear roll down as I realized I could no longer show him the affection I never got.",

The flare cast its sanguine light over the decrepit walls and cavernous ceiling, fading to a bloody crimson as it dissipated into the inky darkness that seemed to stretch on into infinity. I was never keen on subways. We did n' t have them where we were growing up and there was something unnatural about them. Descending into the earth, being swallowed by the ground and the only light comes from harsh fluorescent bulbs that flicker, threatening to go out and leave you alone in the infinite darkness. Unsettling. \" Hello? \" I called out into the void that was waiting beyond the feeble glow of my flare. My voice echoed down the tunnel, decomposing into little more than noise. There was no answer, but the noise has stirred things in the dark. the sounds of scuttling and scampering bounded off the walls, sounding more sinister than I' m sure they were. This place belonged to the rats now, nothing more. And yet... fear has a way of making nightmares dance at edge of your vision, where reality meets your imagination and you swear you see things beyond the safety of the light. It took little more than the footsteps of a few rats to make me freeze. Terrible phantasms waited in the void. I could almost see them, eyes gleaming, jaws hungry. I could *feel* their eyes on me, digging at my skin like fishing hooks. Soundlessly they circled and swirled, taunting me, threatening me. A victim to my own imagination and too paralyzed to flee from such thoughts. The seconds ticked by. The flare burned down. It was time to leave. My flight from that place was swift and undignified, a mad dash back to the sunlight. The tunnel claimed a shoe, a piece of concrete snatching it from my foot as I made my cowardly exit. It may keep it, a trophy of its victory. Never again, I told myself. That place holds nothing but nightmares of my own making.",

The scent of spices being thrown into a mix, the steam rising from a fresh meal. It' s almost as if I could feel the heat next to me. The ticking stirred old memories to resurface.

His face was astonishing, if I did n' t know any better I would say that he was still a boy, it showed no signs of aging whatsoever.

His sense of dressing was just as odd, he always wore a trench coat that seemed too large on sleeve length, and rather than wearing formal shoes he seemed to enjoy wearing light up Spider-Man sneakers. The president was a strange man, but he was a good man, which makes this whole ordeal much more tragic. He quickly won the vote of the nation through his campaign to push the agenda of free video games, less school work, and more allowances, he was a truly visionary man. At his final rally he stepped in to the crowd to greet and shake hands with the attendants of the rally, that' s where it all went wrong. A woman, in her excitement to greet the president, tripped, causing her to violently fling forward and collide with the president, ripping his entire mid section clean from his body.

At the appointed hour, the rulers of all the worlds under the Galactic Protectorate ( an equally grandiose term, for the same reasons cited above ), and all the rulers of the nations of Earth gathered in the stadium that hand been built for the occasion. In orbit, and beyond, a thousand ships sat watching. Our greatest fear was some lone actor or nation would view this as an opportunity for violence, and doom the planet. Some believed we were doomed anyway, and there was no shortage of talk regarding how we might strike one final blow for humanity on our way out. The President walked forward to stand before the Galactic* Emperor. The Emperor was half his height, and it seemed the president might reach out and throw him off the stage, were he so inclined. Instead, he unzipped his pants. As the entirety of the planet watched, he urinated on the Galactic* Emperor. Then, he reached down, and removed his crown, and placed it upon his own head. You see, we had learned in 100 years since first contact that we had no way to beat the Galactic Protectorate militarily, and set ourselves to learning their laws, customs, history, and traditions.

Many of them still have n' t processed the fact that their dead. That they' re in hell. With such a long fall you would think they would figure it out on the way down. It does n' t matter to me though. It' s been too long to remember since I took my fall. Time is irrelevant here. The only thing that matters is winning. I walk up to the recruits and yell, \" ATTENTION! \" My voice shakes the chamber walls when I yell that loud. It' s a nice little trick I' ve picked up from being down here so long. It always strikes terror into the new recruits. Most of them have it figured out by now. The others are in denial, but will soon learn. I inspect my new soldiers to see if there are any that could be useful. Unfortunately they' re all a bit below average. Nothing but meat shields. I give them their \" welcome to hell \" speech, which is quite short. There really is n' t much to explain. It' s torture or be tortured. They happened to fall next to my army, so they belong to me now. I explain to them how it' s impossible to die down here. Instead your injuries simply cause you more and more pain. They wo n' t understand how bad that is until it happens. Even today I still feel burning of every sword and knife that' s gone through your body. Every moment is as if it is happening again over and over for eternity. I tell the recruits to fall in with the other souls. It' s time to move out. We' re heading for a stronghold ten miles north of where we are. It' s held by an enemy faction that has been taking my scouts for the last few weeks. There are n' t many things to lose down here, so losing souls causes me great suffering. I signal to the men to start to move. It wo n' t take us long before we are there. I can almost taste my revenge.",

And sending me off in it. The intelligent Islamic and Chinese philosophers could see their empires were about to fall, victims of tyranny and greed. And their knowledge of the time machine would go with it. So they chose me, a citizen of Scotland, to go to the future. They knew their empires would not survive and proliferate as the English would. I awake in a dark chamber. I can feel my body dying. Dehydrated, out of energy. The time machine had barely left me alive. Suddenly, knocking I hear on my dark enclosure. The doors rips open, and a dark-skinned fella stands above me, with his dog. He tells me I' m in Camp David. He tells me he' s the President of the United States. He tells me matter-of-factly that he' s human. I did n' t get a single meaning of what he said. Camp David? Nope. United States? Nope. President? Nope. Human being? HELL NOPE. He laughed and picks me up, pats me on my back, and leads me to a bendy chair. As I place my bottom on it, I feel the softest leather underneath. I am now royalty, I believed. And then my arms were locked in place, and I was knocked out by a killer dose of anaesthesia. When I awoke, my body was back to its original fuller self. Frail I was not anymore. Obama, he said his name was. He said he' d fixed my dying body within two days of my sleep. This chap was magic. A wizard.

She was always there, in the middle of a crowd of women, not weeping but looking up at him, squinting in the face of the afternoon son with lines etched around her mouth and eyes. He opened his mouth to call out to her but the words stuck in his dusty throat. He swallowed, tried to spit, and opened his mouth again. Just then his knees buckled and white fire exploded around his ankles. He was lost in the fire and his eyes rolled back into his head. Some undetermined time later, he opened his eyes and she was there again. Still not weeping. He was determined to yell out to her, even if just once, to let he know he saw her, he loved her. He tried to draw a breath but a band across his chest prevented the expansion of his lungs. His mouth opened and closed wordlessly. A single tear slipped from his eye, down his wasted cheek. One word, that' s all he wanted. Suddenly a silver pin prick pain jabbed at his right hip. His eyes closed and he drifted away. \" Damn, \" Brad said. \" He put up a fight today, dude.

My legs twist first, their natural angle bent backwards, hair receding as the change progressed up my body, until I was bare on the forest floor again. My mind, as the humans called it, had retained most of the information I had gathered since my first night, and I had plenty of time to add to it. Granted the markings had changed from letters to their own unique system, and the pillars were replaced with grey and clear. I had the foresight to leave myself a pack for this, and hurriedly changed. While the nip in the air would not kill me, another seeing me with no coverings in winter would bring out... unwelcome attention. My plan was the same as every full moon, walk around the city that was beginning to encroach my forest, and I jinxed myself by believing the night would be mishap free. As it were and often is, there was another plan in place. The smell came first. While dulled, it was still sharper than most of my current-kin. Fear, especially, was potent enough to smell even among the cold smell of forest. Instinct kicked in, as I recognized it as the fear of something young.

There are two great books, each coming from one of the gods.

A fourth great book is the Book of Old Stories. One of the stories is about the great empire of Tonatefor whose people tried to worship both the Good One and the Evil One, depending of what was the best in the moment.

But the people would n' t believe it. They hung him. It was the first time anyone had been hung for magic in a very long time, and it was usually in England. His body is still there, as far as I know. Hanging from the line, in the middle of the street, in full view of the still wrecked White House. A reminder of why we are now hated. The world leaders met, and the people watched with hatred in their eyes. The mages, sorcerers and magicians watched with fear. Finally, a decision was made, and it was not a good one. But we did n' t know that yet. We did n' t know until they burst down our doors. We did n' t know until a dozen of us had been gunned down. Our crime? Being different. We were hunted. Laws were put in place against us. We were expelled from society. Even those who simply practiced sleight of hand were to stop calling themselves magicians. Instead, they were' tricksters,' and afterwards had to prove that what they were doing was indeed possible without magic, for fear of being executed for what they practice. We tried to fight back. But very few of us were brave enough to band together a' resistance.' Instead, I witnessed many lone mages fighting off hordes of men, soldiers and civilians alike. None succeeded, for none had enough power. A lot of us went in to hiding. Others fled. The rest died, by their own hand or the hand of others. Some Countries rounded up all their magii and sorcerers, and put them in a new arena, a cruelty not heard of since ancient Rome. Me? I' m a messenger. A practicer of Alteration and Conjuration. I roam from place to place, country to country, bringing supplies, and hopefully some day, a message of hope, to the secret underground communities of the magically gifted.",

Starting with infamous line \" My anaconda do n' t want none if you aint got buns hun \" The famous giant anaconda snake is a symbol of Brazil. This lyric highlights the tragic brazillian dependance on US aid and shunning of local produce. But it' s a little known fact just who that voice belongs to. It is in fact the voice of a famous 20th century philosopher known only as Sir Mixalot. Most of his work has been lost to time but he is famed for his inability to lie. This choice of speaker gives the song a distinct undertone of honesty, ethics and integrity. \" I let him hit it cus he sling cocaine \". At first listen this line may sound like gibberish to our modern ears. However sling is an old colloquial term for throwing and cocaine was a deadly illegal drug that plagued the streets of Oil age America. So it appears Nicki allowed this man to discipline her pet snake because he works in law enforcement discarding cocaine. \" I got a big butt \". Now butts are one part of a type of primitive gunpowder weapon very popular at the time. In this line she is implying that she is very well armed. Presumably for the fending off of criminals. The deranged laughter at the beginning of the line highlights the giddy thrill of controlling such ( for the time ) powerful weaponry. I conclude that this song is about resisting the decay of civilization. It is nothing more or less than a great rallying cry against crime and injustice. With any luck this epic ballad of courage will echo through the generations and be heard in our own time.",

Data flows between continents; it traverses oceans. Anything we could ever want to know is at the tips of our fingers. Our knowledge grows each day, and our experiences entwine and spin a beautiful web. A web that we can not touch or see with our own eyes, only through the interfaces that allow it. Our thirst for understanding has taken us great distances, in both the physical and metaphorical sense; man' s influence has spread as far as eighteen billion kilometres from home, and we are beginning to understand the construct of everything that exists. We can circulate the world in less than a day. Our lifespans have doubled over the last century thanks to medical research. This increase would be greater, if it were n' t for the one thing we value more than a human life: Money. Money is what holds us back as a species. We are willing to do pathetic, senseless and degrading acts against humanity in pursuit of such wealth. We murder other human beings for money. Money governs society. In turn, society develops around economy, and some nations have become run by the corporations that earn for it. Powerful countries exploit weaker ones for their resources, preventing their advancement. We have the capacity to develop so much faster, yet we are held back by those in pursuit of materialistic gains. Why teach a man to fish, when you could sell him a fish every day for the rest of his life? Greed is a shackle on our society, and the key was thrown out long ago. While our technology has the capability to link us together, our greed is only pushing us further apart.",

These were n' t the eyes of a killer but of a beast with an undying rage. This was a beast who' s master had been slaughtered. There were four us who dared to stop the beast. Koren went in to the den first. A man too proud to ever accept help or assistance. A battle cry and a loud, bone shattering crunch were the only sounds heard. His limp body was thrown from the den. We constructed a grave for him. We placed his sword in his grave with him. If there is an afterlife, he will need it. The twins Ryker and Rayk now entered the den. I heard the sound of projectiles flying through the air, accompanied with the sound of them hitting their mark. A roar emerged from the den with enough force to shoot Ryker out of the den like a bat out of hell. He hit tree, his back was broken when I reached him. \" Help. \" Was all he could get out. I nodded my head as I thrust my dagger into his chest. The cave had grown silent. I approached to Rayk lying face down in a pool of blood. On his arm was a message. For the Village was all it said. I now turned to face the dragon with my dagger still unsheathed. In the ancient tongue I yelled, \" I am Yagua. Fear me and all that I am and will become. \" The dragon breathed a fire as if he were a volcano. We fought not for our own sake, but for our races. We fought tooth for tooth, and nail for claw. After what seemed like an hour of fighting, the dragon stumbled. I pierced his heart with my dagger. I am the victor. I dug graves for Ryker and Rayk next to Koren. I walked back to town to hear the cries of joy, the applause, and the singing. I was not a hero, but a savior. Day by day, more dragons perish by our hands. We have taken back half of our land.

I grabbed some loose knitting strands and a spare knitting needle to get started. At first, the spider was scared and did not want to come near me or the materials. It took some coaxing but I was finally able to gently pick the spider up. I placed it on the needle and offered it one of the strands to start knitting with. However, the spider just sat there, not moving or understanding what I wanted it to do. I tried moving its legs to wrap the yarn around the needle but it just wiggled away. After many failed attempts, I realized spiders may not have the dexterity for knitting. Feeling bad that I was stressing out the spider, I gave up for the day. The next day, I decided to try a different approach. I laid out the knitting strands in a way that made a path for the spider to walk on. To my surprise, it started slowly making its way along the yarn. Encouraged, I kept gently moving and repositioning the strands, hoping it would start wrapping them inadvertently. But the spider remained focused on just walking, not knitting. Seeing it was not getting the hang of it, I rethought the whole plan. Maybe knitting was too complex an activity for such a small creature. I began wondering if I could teach it any skills at all.Dejected, I was ready to call it quits when I noticed the spider attempting to wrap a strand around one of its legs as it walked. Eureka! This gave me an idea. What if I made the knitting much smaller in scale and literal? I grabbed even thinner yarn and worked on winding it around the needle a millimeter at a time while the spider walked. To my amazement, after a few tries it had created a miniature knitted stitch without even realizing. Encouraged by this small success, I decided to keep patiently working with the spider, taking the lessons one tiny step at a time.",

Just as he was about to attack, the mammoth suddenly lurched forward—but not of its own accord. It had been hit by a metal dart that shot from a nearby machine. Ogg watched in horror as mechanical limbs extended from the machine and dismantled the mammoth for its parts. Centuries later, in the year 3000 A.D., Ogg's descendant Dorik was now a skilled machine hunter. Where once men hunted beasts, now they hunted rogue AIs and automated machines that had turned against humanity. Dorik's unit received a call—an ancient recycling robot had malfunctioned and was destroying a nearby scrapyard. Dorik raced to the scrapyard and engaged the machine with his high-powered energy lance. After a ferocious battle, Dorik prevailed and dismantled the robot, ensuring it could no longer harm humans.",

They calculated that total planetary destruction was imminent unless action was taken. In a secret underground lab, the world's top physicists devised an audacious plan to save humanity. They would send all of mankind's knowledge and accomplishments into the far future through a one-way wormhole. With just days until impact, the entire population was informed of the dire situation and the desperate solution. People from all nations volunteered for cryogenic freezing to be launched through the portal. When the alien spacecraft slammed into Earth, it completely annihilated the planet. But one hundred years later, on the other side of the wormhole, cries were heard as the first humans were successfully thawed. They emerged into a time when the destroyers had long since moved on. The people got to work reviving their civilization with all they had preserved from the past. Within a few short decades, a new society was thriving. One day sensors detected the return of the mysterious invaders. But this time, humanity was revived and ready to face the threat with all the wisdom of Earth's greatest achievements.",

After a moment, I found a small button and pressed it. A dim blue light flickered on. In the glow, I saw it was some kind of metal device, with odd symbols and markings lined up in rows. My heart raced, wondering what this mysterious object could be and why it was hidden away in here. When I pressed another button, a hologram suddenly projected from the top, showing information written in a language I didn't understand. \"I have to find a way to translate this,\" I thought, picking it up to examine it closer. What secrets did this device hold, and what would discovering them mean for me, or even the world?",

They seemed dazed and moved slowly, grunting incomprehensibly. The CDC was called in to investigate and soon confirmed their fears - this was the first outbreak of zombies in America. Within hours, several more people had turned.The military was deployed, but coordinating a response proved difficult due to the zombies' random movements. They shambled down streets, occasionally grabbing at anyone they happened to encounter.However, it quickly became apparent that the zombies possessed no real coordination or higher brain function. They wandered aimlessly and could barely manage to eat the occasional victim.After only a day, the zombies had mostly just laid down in the middle of roads or fields, losing interest once their immediate hunger was satisfied. With no real packs or communicated threats, they posed little danger.The remaining living inhabitants of the town were easily able to avoid the shambling corpses or fight them off one by one when needed. By nightfall, most zombies had simply collapsed motionless. An autopsy of one zombie revealed it had died of starvation, as it was unable to effectively hunt or forage on its own. Within 25 hours, the last zombie had expired, marking the end of the outbreak.The CDC declared the zombie threat neutralized. It seemed that without human coordination or intelligence, individual zombies were effectively harmless on their own.The town began to rebuild, and the federal government launched studies to better understand how to contain future outbreaks, which they hoped would also prove as ineffectual as the first.Many were left to wonder what might have happened if the zombies had displayed even basic survival skills or pack instincts, but for now, the residents could rest easy knowing the threat had passed.",

As a teenager he was reckless but also kind-hearted. He fell in love for the first time at age 17 and had his heart broken. Still, he picked himself up and kept going.The man I was watching started college but struggled to find his path. He drifted for a while after graduation, unsure of his purpose. During this time he hurt some who cared for him as he searched. One night he hit rock bottom after heavy drinking. Something changed within him that night. He committed to turning his life around and figured out what he truly wanted - to help others. He enrolled in nursing school and excelled at caring for the sick. Soon he met his soulmate and they wed, supporting each other through challenges.They started a family together and he was a loving, engaged father. Though money was sometimes tight, he gave his all to his work saving lives. As the years went by he remained dedicated to his career and community service on the side. Tragedy struck when he was in his 50s - a terrible accident took his wife from him. Grief almost broke the man but he found solace in his faith and remained devoted to his kids. In his final decades he doted on his growing grandchildren while still going above and beyond for his patients. When approaching his last days, he had no regrets about how he lived. As the movie of his life ended, I was stunned to realize it was my own life I had just witnessed.

Everything felt gray and bleak. They often thought about just ending it all to escape this existence. But there was one small reason they kept going each day. Their morning cup of coffee. Silly as it seemed, preparing that first cup was sometimes the only thing getting them out of bed. The warm caffeinated drink gave them a small boost of energy to face the day. They savored every sip, letting the flavor wake up their taste buds almost as much as their tired mind and body.For those few brief minutes, the troubles and drudgery of daily life seemed to fade away. All that mattered was the rich aroma and taste. It was a small pleasure but one they looked forward to.Without it, they weren't sure they could find the will to start each new day of the same unending cycle. So they clung to this simple daily ritual, hoping it could keep pulling them through until something changed. Maybe one day they would find a reason beyond their morning coffee to keep going.

I pleaded for more time, for a chance to make amends and say goodbye. But death does not bargain, it only collects what is owed. As the scythe rose, memories of my life flooded through my mind. I saw loved ones who had long passed, moments of joy and sorrow, and all the mistakes I wished I could undo. Death paused, as if considering my request. Then, slowly, it lowered the blade. \"One week,\" came a hollow voice on the wind. Relief and gratitude washed over me, even as doubt lingered. What could really change in just a week? There was so little time to make amends for all my sins. I set to work immediately, visiting old friends and adversaries to ask forgiveness where I could. Some were understanding, others less so, but every conversation brought me closer to peace. In spare moments I wrote letters to my loved ones, hoping words could convey what was left unsaid in life. The days passed swiftly, each holding its own moments both bitter and sweet. Old wounds were reopened only to start healing anew. By the final night, a sense of closure had come, though an underlying sadness remained. As midnight struck, I felt death's cold touch upon my shoulder once more. \"It is time,\" that hollow voice whispered. I nodded, ready now to accept what could not be changed. In life we are given both joy and sorrow, and it is up to each of us to find meaning even in death's embrace.

While others ran from sickness, necromancers approached with objectivity born from understanding the transition of life. When the plague came, it was to Jericho's clinic that people came, not the church's priests. Through souls exchanged in ritual and knowledge taken from cadavers, Jericho had mapped the human body in ways no medic ever could. As patients shuddered with fever, their flesh burning from within, Jericho searched not their eyes but their essence, probing movements of spirit to find wounds in body. Many awoke healed where before they had waited only for death. Suspicion grew as souls left the city faster than the plague itself, but Jericho did not care, focused only on repairing the harms of sickness through knowledge others called blasphemy. The priests began to preach the plague as God's anger at such unholy meddling, urging people to shun Jericho's den of iniquity. Yet still the ill came, drawn by rumors of hope where once was only loss.One night, robed figures surged into Jericho's clinic, come to cleanse the city of his affront to divine will through fire and blade.

By this point I wasn't sure whether to believe him or send him on his way. \"Alright Yahweh, prove to me you were really God,\" I challenged. \"As God I cannot do miracles now, but I know things no mere mortal would,\" he said cryptically.

For centuries I wandered the empty cities, fading monuments to a lost civilization. Slowly nature reclaimed the landscape, forests growing unchecked in deserted parks. I became solitary, speaking to no one, dreaming of company. Over millennia, I accumulated knowledge and skills from the remnants of human works. With care and effort, I sculpted the wilderness into ordered forms, cultivating plants and tending herds. In a sheltered valley, I constructed a small house and gathered supplies to last through the coming ages. Seeds from each season were harvested and replanted, sustaining life's cycle. Technology was repaired or reproduced to ease my work and provide comforts. Books and artworks rescued from ruins furnished my simple home. music filled the evenings, imagined conversations my only solace. Through diligent labor, a flourishing paradise emerged, yet my isolation endured. Though alone in body, in spirit I walked with remembered humanity. This bucolic realm became my quiet tribute to their passing, and proof that from ashes, beauty may arise again.",

Our assignment was to paint and hopefully animate a simple landscape. I painted a meadow under a setting sun, but couldn't get the charm right. The sky darkened too quickly, and shadowy figures emerged from the trees. Their faces were blank and body movements jagged. Professor Sprout tried to end the animation but it wasn't working. The figures approached me, reaching with twisting limbs. I stumbled backwards dropping my wand. The other students screamed and backed away. Professor Sprout cast a Shield Charm between me and the figures. She tried more advanced counter spells to no avail. The Headmistress was summoned, blasting the painting with a curse that tore it to pieces. I was shaken but unharmed as the pieces turned to ash. Professor McGonagall told me not to feel badly, but I knew painting class was not for me.",

Despite our differences, we had both fought on the front lines and seen the horrors of war. An uneasy truce formed as we began to talk, sharing stories of battles survived and comrades lost. Over drinks, the tension melted away as we found our experiences in many ways mirrored each others'. We had both witnessed atrocities committed by our own sides as much as the enemy's. Seltar told me of daring bombing missions in cramped fighter pods, the fear and adrenaline that came with every fight. I told him of leading platoons through hellish ground skirmishes, always wondering who wouldn't return.Our conversations continued late into the night, ignoring increasingly disapproving looks from others unsure if former enemies could truly bury the hatchet.

Leaning into him, she let the tears flow freely as he wrapped an comforting arm around her shoulders. They remained that way as the clouds darkened the sky and first drops of rain began to fall. Even as the rain increased, soaking them through, neither made to leave the other's side. Something passed between them in that moment, a connection forged without a single word.",

After years of chasing meaningless ambitions, I finally understood what really mattered: finding my sister who had gone missing in these very woods years ago. Despite the local authorities having given up, I knew in my heart she was still out there waiting to be found. As the train slowed into the small station, I slung my backpack over my shoulder, my feet moving with renewed purpose down the platform toward the dense forest edge. For days I hiked endless trails, asking anyone I met if they had seen a young girl matching her description. Just as my hope was fading, on the fourth day a stranger mentioned seeing a campsite deep in a hidden valley. With energy reinvigorated, I pushed on determined to find the one thing that mattered most.",

Yet she still crept into my thoughts at quiet moments, reminding me of what we had and what was lost. Now, turning down a street in a new city, I spotted her walking just ahead.

Without thinking, I pulled over and ran to catch up. \"Sarah?\" I asked, hoping beyond hope it wasn't a dream. She turned, eyes widening in disbelief. \"James?\" We stood in silence for a moment, taking each other in. Eight long years evaporated in an instant. There was so much to say, but for now simply being together again was enough.",

They brought him their praise and questions, keeping his spirit lively against the loneliness of his task.One evening, as a great storm rolled in, Barnabas spied a cluster of stars gone dark. He worked through the night, circling within the dome as rain lashed against its metal hide. Come morning, exhausted but satisfied, he spotted a lone girl climbing the hill, a bundle in her arms against the cold. \"The little ones are with you tonight,\" she said, offering him her provisions.Barnabas smiled, knowing his work would live on in kindness, as long as there were those who remembered the stars.

By his count, this made the twenty-fifth rendition of doomsday he had borne witness to. As the ash rained down, obscuring whatever had delivered yet another blow to humanity this time, he thought back on the prior endings they had survived. The meteor that had scorched the earth, incinerating all but a handful who cowered in bunkers below. The alien invasion that had leveled cities with otherworldly weapons beyond imagination. Even the timelines collapsing in on themselves in a paradox, reality unraveling until only Ted seemed immune to the breakdown. Each restart had whittled the population down further, until now he wondered if he and the two others huddled with him in the remnants of a collapsed skyscraper were the last left. Sally shivered next to him, her fraying nerves pushed to the breaking point after surviving so much destruction. Across from them, Gareth stared into the ashfall with deadened eyes, his thunderous fists clenched in his lap - whether from rage or resignation, Ted couldn't tell. They were all that was left of humanity, three souls intertwined by the threads of repeated devastation. As the pattering droplets of ash slowed, Ted knew they would have to venture out into the new wasteland once more to search for sustenance or clues of whether any other survivors remained. But as the toll grew heavier with each rebirth of desolation, he found it harder to summon the will to begin again. How many more resets could the human psyche endure before even the most tenacious spirit shattered under the weight of hopelessness? As the smoke parted, though, a colorful item caught Ted's eye, and he wondered - could this be the sign they needed to spark renewed determination in this latest aftermath?",

Didn't they understand how much we had sacrificed to give their hopeless lives meaning and purpose? Without our guidance and protection, what would become of them in the chaos of the godless world they had created?A small part of me, buried beneath my anger, still felt sorry for the humans and wanted to reach out, to make myself known again so I would not suffer the same fate as my brethren. But after so much hurt, I no longer had the will to expose myself to their betrayals. Let them endure the consequences of their ingratitude, I thought bitterly as my power continued to fade. Maybe when they had hit rock bottom, desperate and afraid in the darkness of a godless universe, they would remember who had once brought light and meaning to their small, fleeting lives. And perhaps, if I still drew breath, I would take pity on them once more. But until that day came, this shithole of a world could burn for all I cared.",

A glint in the rubble- fragments of a broken mirror reflecting my haunted gaze. This face, long buried beneath scars. I turned away, ghosts nipping at my heels. Down darkened alleyways, hollow-eyed survivors scrounged for scraps amidst the ruins. A crack- hiss- a whiff of cordite rushed through the ruins. I stumbled on, boots weighted with the souls of those left for carrion.  An echo in the alley- a shape shifting in the shadows. I froze, sensing unseen eyes trailing my every step. From the swirling ashes, a spectre emerged, gaunt and wraithlike- a fragment of my buried past. It beckoned without a word, drawing me deeper into the maze of falling walls. Through gaping windows, glimpses within: remnants of lives interrupted, hopes now corpses in the view.

At its taloned feet lay a bullet-ridden corpse, eyes staring into nothing, barrel still clutched in rigor mortis claws. I knew its face, though flesh now torn. This ghost, my ghost, come to haunt my every waking moment. I dropped to my knees, tears freezing on my cheeks like crystals of hell.

Unknown dread seized my limbs, rooting me below an old oak. Another sigh drifted from the undergrowth, closer now, before an arrow embedded in the bark beside my head.

The crew worked diligently to circle the planet and scan it for signs of life. Oxygen, water, and basic elements were found in abundance over most of the surface. The windows of the shuttle showed green forests and rivers. Five crewmen put on space suits and boarded the small craft. It detached from the mothership and entered the atmosphere. The landing was smooth, in a grassy field near a lake. Specimens of local flora and fauna were collected for analysis. As the crewmen disembarked, they saw birdlike creatures flying in the sky. Back on the mothership, the samples were tested for danger. Charts were drawn up of the most promising regions for establishing the first outposts. It seemed that this new world could safely support human colonization. The spaceship lifted off and headed home.",

The planet they have discovered life on is called ZX9-Gamma, a rocky, terrestrial world orbiting a red dwarf star 150 light years away. I can’t believe that this planet, which I own, at least in theory, actually has living things on it. According to the news, the Kepler Space Telescope recently detected oxygen in the atmosphere, a clear sign of life. As the owner, am I responsible for them? So many questions swirl in my head. What kind of life? Simple microbes or something more advanced? I decide to go on the Internet and find out more about ZX9-Gamma and what this discovery might mean. I pick up the phone to call Amanda, but her line is busy. I’m sure she’s as upset as I am. The planet has a density and size similar to Earth, but its star is smaller and cooler, which makes the surface temperature more moderate despite its closer orbit. Unfortunately, there isn’t much more information available yet than what was in the news report. Over the next few days, more is learned about the planet and its oxygen-producing inhabitants. Scientists are stunned at the possibility of complex organisms on a planet so different from Earth. The Kepler Space Telescope has shown that whatever is living there has colonized the entire surface and is producing oxygen through photosynthesis at a high rate. As the attention on ZX9-Gamma increases, people start to look at my novelty deed again. Lawyers are debating the legality of such deeds, which were originally intended as joke gifts and not as a way to own property.",

Working together, they defended the church and welcomed the new members.

Grateful for his kindness, she sat down by the fire and told him about her ordeal. The storm outside raged on, and she fell asleep. The next thing she knew, she woke up safely in her own bed.

The machine rumbled and whirred as expected, but instead of the familiar cola can, it spit out a can of orange soda he didn’t recognize.

I hurried through the rest of my shopping, eager to see if this was just an anomaly at this store. But the trend continued at the next shop - even fresh produce had inflated resale prices.

The inflated values showed no signs of slowing. Generators and non-perishables became the new currencies. I grew concerned about how long society could sustain like this. Then, just as suddenly as it started, the resale prices began decreasing again. Within a couple days, values returned to normal levels. The crisis abated but the cause remained a mystery.

All his endless years of work faded, and in her life he found new purpose. Though they could never truly be together, Death had fallen for the one soul he could not claim - and for the first time, he believed there may be more to his cold existence than just collecting human lives.",

As he trod the faint game trail, shadows seemed to stir at the edges of his vision. His heart raced when his flashlight revealed an immense shape amongst the trees. At first, he thought it a bear, but as it turned, the beam illuminated a face unlike any he'd known. Its grin stretched too wide across its nightmarish visage, displaying more teeth than seemed natural. He froze, breath catching in his throat.The creature took a slow step nearer, savoring his terror. Paralyzed, all he could do was stand as it circled him, mouth agape. Saliva dripped from its jaws as it studied him like prey. Every instinct screamed to flee, yet his legs refused to obey. As it closed in, he caught a whiff of its putrid breath. Its grin broadened further, as if scenting his fear. With a Herculean effort, he forced himself to flee blindly into the forest.  Branches tore at his face and clothes as he crashed through the undergrowth. The sounds of pursuit grew ever closer - it toyed with him, relishing the chase. His foot snagged a root and he fell hard, pain lancing through his ankle. Lying helpless, he rolled over to see it looming, drool pouring from its gaping maw. This was the end. With a roar, it lunged for the killing blow. At the last moment, his hand found a fallen branch. With a cry he swung, feeling it connect solidly.The creature recoiled with an unearthly howl. He scrambled up and limped as fast as he could on his injured ankle. Glancing back, he saw it retreating into the shadows, yellow eyes staring after him. Shaken to his core, he forced himself onward toward the distant town lights. The next day, steeling his nerve, he returned to the scene of his ordeal. But the deep woods were as still and silent as ever.",

Job applications, scholarship essays - everything was now long overdue.She had worked diligently in school, always keeping up with assignments. But in her senior year, things started slipping through the cracks. Between extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and general burnout, tasks slowly fell off her to-do list.  One by one, the looming dates came and went unacknowledged as Sara struggled to keep up with never-ending demands on her time. Before she knew it, the semester had ended and she was left with nothing to show for her efforts.Now summer was here and she still had no plans for what came next. Without applications submitted, she wouldn't be attending her dream college in the fall. Scholarship opportunities had expired, and tuition money was slipping away.Lying in bed staring at her phone, Sara scrolled through past reminders and alerts, each representing another chance she let pass her by. How could she have been so careless? Her future was supposed to be set by now.Instead, she drifted without the goals and timeline that had guided her for so long. What would she do if no schools accepted her now? How could she afford an education without aid?Sadness and panic rose in her chest as the full extent of her failure sank in. All because she missed a few deadlines, her path forward had disappeared before her eyes.The road ahead stretched darker than ever. For the first time, Sara didn't know where her life was headed next. Somewhere among the overlooked tasks, she had lost sight of her destiny.",

For centuries, magic had been wielded through manipulation of the four classical elements: earth, air, fire and water, drawn from the natural world. But one promising young mage, Aria, claimed to have discovered a new form of magic beyond the old ways. She began her demonstration, calling upon strands of pure mystical energy which she manipulated through intricate gestures and chants. The audience watched in awe as colors shifted in the air and floating orbs of light appeared.Aria displayed mastery over this unknown magic, twisting the energies into amazing shapes and patterns. However, some older magicians remained skeptical, insisting one could only draw power from stable, time-tested sources. On the final day of trials, Aria sought to change their minds through her most challenging feat yet - summoning a magical construct and breathing life into it through her new form of magic alone. After lengthy preparations, a shimmering creature took form, drawing astonished gasps from all witnesses at its impossible existence. Just as it seemed Aria had triumphed, something went awry with her spell. The magical forces spiraled beyond her control and the glowing being twisted into a malevolent form. With a roar, it turned on the audience as an unnatural storm erupted in the hall. Aria struggled desperately to end her spell but it was too late to stop the chaos. The discovery plunged the Magisterium into crisis as they confronted both the promise and peril of this new type of magic. For uncovering its secrets, Aria would bear the responsibility of where this new path might lead.",

When the transformation ended, I stood naked on two human feet under the cool night air, goosebumps rising across my flesh. I stepped lightly through the forest floor, searching for any signs of civilization amidst the trees. Broken branches and boot prints in the damp earth pointed a way forward. Flickering light gradually emerged between the trunks ahead - a campfire outside a small wooden cabin. An old man sat beside it, puffing on his pipe.Knowing the wind carried my scent, I dared not venture too close. As the moon sank below the horizon, the pull came again to reshape my form. My insides twisted as fur and claws regrew unnaturally. On four paws once more, I turned and melted into the protective shadows of the woods. Perhaps next month, if he still remained, I might try contacting the man. But for now, my strange nature would stay confined to the lunar cycle, a secret kept only between myself and the moon.",

As she made contact, the kitten swiped at her hand with its small claw. \"Ouch!\" cried Sara, feeling the minor prick. Within moments, Sara began to feel strange. It was as if her bones were shrinking and her clothes hung loosely from her diminishing form. Before she knew it, she had collapsed to all fours and continued shrinking rapidly.

They contacted the neighbors and learned of the stray kitten found on their property. Upon seeing the kitten clinging to their son, Sara's parents recognized hints of her favorite sweater coloring in its fluffy coat. They coaxed the kitten away and were stunned when it meowed \"Mom!\" in a tiny voice. After hearing the boy's account, Sara's parents swiftly brought her to the vet, hoping for a cure.The vet examined Sara closely but found no abnormalities from the kitten bite beyond two small holes in her tiny paw pad. He was baffled, having never seen a case like this before, and had no answers on how to reverse the transformation. For now, Sara was stuck in kitten form. At home, she took comfort in playing with old toys and drinking milk through an eyedropper.",

Disputеs over territory and resources led to increasing violence between tribes. Rais and attacks became common as people fought desperately for dwindling supplies. Over time, these skirmishes escala𝚝ed in scale and intensity. Small acts of aggression grew into fuⅼl-fledged tribal warfare. Without modern weapons, people were forced to resot to basic tools. Spears, axes, and clubs replaced bombers and missiles as the novel instruments of conflict. Tribal leaders recognized the opportunity to expand their power and reosurces through military force. World War IV had begun, just as Albert Einstein had projected decades earlier. This new global war would ravage the planet using only age-old tools elaborated from stone and wood. Entire clans were exterminated as borders shifted across radioactive wastelands. A bleak future stretched before the battered survivors of humanity's hugest mistakes. All hopes for rebuilding civilization seemed lost amid the anarchy. Unless mankind found a w ay to overϲome its primal instincts of violence and vengeance, there could be no recovery from the damage already done. But in these dark times, such wisdom emerged beyond reach.",

Paul's steaԁfast friendship had event ually turned to love, and he understood my pains in a way no one else could. Still, a small par𝚝 of me never fuly let go of you, of what we had even in our short time together. Sittinɡ across from you now, I felt those dormant feelings tugging at my soul once more. You seemed to noice, giving me a thoughtful, almost sad look. We mentioned for hours it felt, catching up but also holding so much unsaid. The sun was low in the sky by the ti me you stood up to leave. I walked you to your car, knowing that tomorrow would carry another separation. But for now, it was еnough just to have seen you after all this time. It was enоugh to know that a part of my heart was still yours.",

My whole life I had fel𝚝 out of place in a world where everyone switched between two or three distinct perѕonas. Growing up was lonely, watching my peers effortless slip between clever jokes and heartfelt emotional support. I struggled to keep up, never feelіng fully myself with any friend. When I realized I never spli𝚝, I knew something had to be wrong with me. My parents were concerned when I told them my suspiϲions. They brought me to the leading experts in personali𝚝y disorders. After a bat𝚝ery of tests, the diagnosis was confirmed - I had SPD, and was the very first known case. Nova scientists crowded around, firing question after question. \"How do you maintain relationships without being able to share the emoti onal labor?” \"What do you do when you need advice from a separate perspective?\" l had no answers for them. All I knew was a ϲonstant feeling of being alone, even in crowds. While others built intimate boոds by exploring differeոt sides of themselves with loved ones, I remained tethered to my singular view of the world. Weeks of observer yielded no insights. My sngle mind baffled the researchers to no end. Press coverage tuned me into a medical mystery, but I wished only to feel normal again. Beiոg studied like a zoo animal grew tiresome. I decided to withdraw from examination and live as anonymously as possible. Saying goodbye to the scientists, I hoped in solitude to find pe ace. Oսt of the lab, normal life brought new challenges. Work became lonelу as coworkers collaborated across their personas. Relationships fell apart withoսt the balance of multiple selves. As the yearѕ went by in isolation, I began to accept my condition. While others thrived on community, my true self was meant for loneliness. In quіet reflection, I discovered unexpected gifts.",

I love the NBA and I'm on a mission to be able to see every team play in person. Hopefully I'll be able to accomplish that in my lifetime. What was really super cool about this game is that Michael Jordan himself was there! I was SO stoked about that! I kept pointing and telling my husband throughout the entire game, \"There's Michael Jordan! There's Michael Jordan! \" I mean, I didn't get to meet him or anything as awesome as that, but we had great seats and I was able to see him the entire time. I'm not sure if I did more basketball watching or Michael Jordan watching. LOLnnEven though I'm not a fan, the Bobcats are a good team and I'm still very happy I was able to see them play in person! =)",

I understand (and enjoy! ) the concept of \"open kitchen\" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants.

It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes. The only disappointing thing was the portion size.

This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's. I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal. I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries. In addition I ordered a \"Minced\" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ. nnFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared. They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce. I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy. It was \"okay\" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for. nnAs for the barbecue, it is also \"okay;\" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen). In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue. The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.",

Which is fine. nnOn warm weekend days, there can be a somewhat fratty scene at the pool, which is commonplace in Charlotte. Loud music, beer, generally partying are big on weekends at complex's pools. nnGenerally, the management has been reliable; lights are fixed, plumbing issues are dealt with quickly, and they're really on top of their communication. Sometimes on the weekends parties will go late in other apartments, which is annoying from a noise perspective, but people are pretty respectful of neighbors. nnMy biggest complaint is that the hallways are pretty drab (like a back stairwell), but the units themselves are really nice.

If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement. nnSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before. The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi. nnPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation. It was a very simple dish put together. nnSake - they are pricey. $15. 00 minimum. nnRamen - the soup was very tasty. nnOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before. I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip.

I didn't find the bbq sauce too vinegary; kind of disappointed in that, but never the less it was all GOOD! I thought the Cherry Lemon Sundrop could of had more cherry syrup and lemon flavoring, but over all it was tasty and refreshing.

You would think something with \"ember\" in its name would emit a bit of warmth in its ambiance. The menu seemed a little limited, and we were starving and I was getting cranky so we actually opted for the bar for appetizers while we decided what to do. I highly recommend the \"10\" sampler, which included small bites of rare ahi, goat cheese quesadilla, buffalo wings, hummus and smoked salmon. Great deal for $14. J got a delicious Kobe burger and we relaxed in the spacious bar, and soaked in the cocktail hour jazz piano. Room service was just okay. The staff was all very pleasant with the exception of the disinterested waiter in the bar; strangest service I may have ever encountered. I think maybe he was trying to pull off some sort of NYC attitude schtick in Charlotte. It was amusing at least. Nice stay, nice location. No MSNBC, this and the waiter cost them a star.",

The lady kept arguing. My son walked out. I called and finally had to hang up. Also, one other time I told them only an eye exam  not the doctor exam (due to diabetes) they went ahead and did the doctor exam after I was very clear with them not to do a doctor's exam.

And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago.. . They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not. nnI had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili. nnNow, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty! nnAnother plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili! )nnNow the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco. nnOverall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though. Next time though, I'm sticking away from those tacos.",

And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge.

No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7: 00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break.

The new doctor told me that the x-rays were of \"such poor quality\" that there was no way anyone could make a diagnosis from them, adding \"it's typical for podiatrists to utilize poor imaging equipment\".

Neither dish was particularly fresh or inspiring, however. nnMy thought: if you need a place to go that's consistent, Baoding is a good choice. If you're a food adventurer seeking authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere. I would not characterize Baoding as a good Chinese restaurant, but I will say it is a good Chinese-American restaurant.",

My dining companion started off with the Salt & Pepper Calamari, which I did not have any of, but it appeared to be well prepared, and must have been good because she ate it all (it's not a huge portion). nnTheir lunch items are served with either a cup of soup or a salad.

I was starving.. . and I knew my dinner tonight was going to be a $. 20 package of ramen noodles) I ordered the Banana Spring Rolls which are pretty much bananas wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, fried and then served with coconut-pineapple ice cream and drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauces.

My husband also wanted the sleeves on the two short sleeved shirts taken in a 1/2 inch. Our total bill was almost $60.

That means we paid 8. 20 for club soda and a cherry.. hmmmmnI ordered the Spaghetti all Gricia.. it was thin spaghetti and caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon, and pecorino cheese. Very interesting.. not Italian but really good. . but I would rename it Bacon Lo Mein.. . My Husband ordered the Lasagna, he said it was good but the meat was stringy?? Our friends had the Pollo Romano, which was basically a Chicken Parm, it was a great size portion, and seemed like our friend enjoyed it. Her partner had the Cotoletta ala bolognese, it was a fried chicken cutlet topped with Parmesan cheese and proscuitto, It was also a nice size portion but it was swimming in grease, like the cheese had melted and they used to much oil to fry it.. they did replate it for my friend but she could still not eat it and they very nicely took it off the bill. nThe desert.. .. was the VERY best thing on the menu--NUTELLA PIE.. It was a combo of Nutella, peanut butter, marscapone cheese with a graham cracker crust.. . heavenly, I would have eaten more but I had filled up on the bread! nAll in all.. its a okay dinner place.. . not authentic Italian at all.. Large family style portions, but not my AMORE.. . Loved our company.. not so much the meal.. Sorry Mama.. ..",

This preserved, pickled thing is inescapable - if it isn't a preserved roasted pepper overwhelming your salad, it's a pickled artichoke or so many Kalamatas (yay Greece) smothering your pizza that any chance of digging on the housemade mozz is gone. Even Bruschetta tastes like it's been doused with anti-aging liquids and sat at the bottom of a very deep fridge for who knows how long. nnIn true Olive Garden style, salads are overdressed before making it to your table, so it's all a wilty, mixed up mess. That ain't how they do it in Italia, kids! That's how they do it in Bottomless Breadstickville. nnService is probably where they've spent the most energy and it shows - people are quick, smiley, knowledgeable.

The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. nnThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. nnAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better.

He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well. nnI thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath. If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter.. . lesson learned. nnOn a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces. So for me Mert's is just ok.",

From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount. nnSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers. nnWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \"Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check! ). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. nnSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help. nnAnd what's a cake without icing? Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands. Hands, cigarette, mouth, touching customers. YUCK!",

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom. nnStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out. nnBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9. 95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel. nnMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer.

I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent.

It is divided into appetizers, mid courses, salads, cheese courses, entrees, and specials. nnWe began with the Tega Hills bibb lettuce salad with warm duck confit, as well as the Moroccan Kefta meatballs. The salad was scrumptious. It was really working that whole sweet and salty thing. Meatballs were not my pick, but WOW they were good. Served with a charmoula sauce which is heavy on the garlic, parsley and cumin, in a very good way. nnPer our waitress' recommendation (who was GREAT by the way), I had the pan seared Australian sea bass. It was served on top of a diced butternut squash with ginger brown butter. It was light  yet decadent at the same time. nnOur waitress gave great recommendations and was totally enthusiastic about the menu. I love it when people get as excited about food as me.

You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant. The special is $8 and is plenty of food. (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen.

I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.

The roti was cold but the perfect and spicy gravy compensated for that. I would highly recommend everyone to try roti canai, at least one time. This is a nice appetizer. nnI had a curry flavor from the Chef's Specialties. It was perfect. Very well cooked vegetables in the curry, made me happy. The meal was big for me after I had roti so go with the big appetite. I have to pack the left over but I know it would taste yummy next day. Any spicy food taste delicious next day. That's the fantastic fact about spices. nnAs per my visit to this restaurant, it was favorable. The staff was friendly. Although I wanted to sit on a high tool or a high chair in the bar area but they made me sit at the short chair area in the bar area. That's fine. No harm done. nnThe food made all the difference. The menu looked really great and it was hard for me to decide as everything on it seemed worth trying. I went for a simple (according my gut feeling) and predictable (as one can think) dish which was Curry Flavor. I have become very picky since I become pesceterian. Instead of trying sushi or seafood stuff, I went for pure vegetarian. I can confidently say that many vegetarian folks would like this place. They have few items on the menu for vegetarians. nnOverall, I like this place.",

The also have beer offerings, and that compliments the food really well. A lot of pizza joints don't, sadly, and that just won't cut it with me. nnI got two slices: buffalo chicken and spinach-tomato-ricotta, and both were pretty great. The buffalo chicken was amazing, but feel free to add Texas Pete's hot sauce (there are plenty of bottles available) to give it some extra zing. The other slice was good, too, although a little heavy on the ricotta. Shockingly, I also got a side salad and couldn't believe it: all the veggies and lettuce were fresh and crunchy. Great value for just a few bucks. Don't fear trying one if you're not looking to get completely full throwing down an entire pie.",

The best thing about this place is its location on College Street. There are so many exceptional restaurants within just a few blocks. And, downtown Charlotte is lovely! So many fountains, open areas, gardens to visit. nnMy other BIG complaint about this place.. .. charging too much for Wi-Fi packages. Look, stop being cheap. Business and trade groups are already paying you huge $$$ for the place and services. Throw in wireless. Why is this such a hassel? Because in many places, something about the building seems to really disrupt wireless data signals to your 3G/4G phone.

The menu had a wide variety of Mexican fare, from tacos and burritos to fajitas and enchiladas. I opted for the vegetarian fajitas while my girlfriend chose the shrimp tacos. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves as we chatted and caught up over drinks and appetizers. Our meals arrived and everything was delicious. The fajitas had mixed grilled veggies that were perfectly seasoned. After finishing our meals, we had some flan for dessert which was light and creamy. As more people had a few drinks, the conversations got louder and more lively. Around 10 pm we moved to the small dance floor area as a few songs with a Latin beat came on. My girlfriend and I enjoyed dancing for a while but then retreated to our seats, tired but happy. By midnight, the party was starting to wind down as some folks had to work in the morning. We all pitched in to chip away at the leftover appetizers and chips. Before leaving, we made sure to wish the birthday girl one final happy birthday with another round of drinks.

The plot is nearly incomprehensible and jumps around erratically from scene to scene. I'm still not really sure what the overall story was even trying to be. The directing feels sloppy and unfocused, without much in the way of coherent storytelling.  All the characters are bizarre stereotypes with no depth or motivation for their strange behaviors. The acting is definitely some of the worst I've seen in quite a while. It seems like the filmmakers were going for some kind of surreal or dreamlike feel but just didn't execute it well at all. Most of the scenes left me completely confused as to what was supposed to be happening. The cinematography was also pretty poor with odd shot selections and framing. The lighting felt very amateurish in a lot of spots too. The editing was choppy and disjointed so it was hard to follow any kind of flow or timeline of events. The weird soundtrack choices often didn't match the scenes they accompanied. There was also way too much random bizarre imagery thrown in that didn't seem to serve any real purpose. By the end, I was just desperate for it to be over because it was such a frustrating watch. I can't imagine anyone walking away understanding or enjoying this movie. It was an epic mess from beginning to end. I'd recommend avoiding this film at all costs unless you really enjoy being completely confused and annoyed for 90 minutes. Otherwise, there are much better ways to spend your time than on this incoherent slog of a movie.",

While it allows diners to experience higher-end restaurants for more affordable prices, it also creates logistical nightmares for kitchen and service staff. Deals that seem too good to be true often are, as compromises must be made to offer meals at a discounted rate. Extensive multi-course menus give way to streamlined, pared-down options with limited selection. Servers and chefs find themselves rushed off their feet to accommodate double or triple the usual volume of diners in shortened time slots. Quality is sacrificed to some degree as ingredients, cooking times and plating get scaled back. For diners, the experience lacks the leisurely pace and personalized touch of a regular night out. And disappointed customers taking to Yelp and Twitter to gripe about long waits or rushed service can damage a restaurant's reputation. During Restaurant Week, each reservation feels like an assembly line with little room forerrors. Exhausted staff feel more like cogs in a machine than culinary artists. While the promotion no doubt brings in new patrons, it often leaves existing regular customers fed up with the chaos and avoiding their favorite spots that week. On the flip side, the marketing boost and revenue from all the extra covers is hard for restaurants to pass up. With careful planning of menus, staffing and logistics, some operators manage to navigate Restaurant Week with minimal compromises.

While they may still be building for the future, their hustle and skill make them extremely fun to watch live at the Spectrum Center. The arena itself offers great views from all seats along with amenities like restaurants and shops in the surrounding area. Fan enthusiasm at Bobcats games is infectious as the crowd gets fully invested in every possession. Halftime also provides entertainment from the hype squad or performances by local musicians. On select nights, fans can stay after the final buzzer to get autographs from their favorite players as they exit the floor. Ticket prices are also reasonable so the whole family can enjoy an exciting NBA experience.  The team also gives back to the community through their charitable work and appearances. Being part of a Bobcats game lets you feel connected to both the team and the city of Charlotte. Whether you're a die-hard basketball fan or just looking for an entertaining night out, a Bobcats home tilt delivers on both entertainment and adrenaline.",

The food was atrocious, by far the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant. My order was wrong, the portions were tiny and everything tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The service was no better, it took over 45 minutes just to get our drinks and we had to ask multiple times for refills. The staff seemed overwhelmed and disinterested in helping customers. Basic sanitation standards were not being met either, I saw employees handling food with bare hands and dirty dishes piled up in the back. The bathrooms were disgusting, I couldn't even use them because of the smell. Overall the establishment was run down and dingy looking, it was in desperate need of a renovation. I just don't understand why anyone would continue choosing to eat here when there are so many better dining options nearby. The only reason I can think of for their continued business is convenience or low prices. But you really do get what you pay for because the low cost definitely doesn't make up for the awful experience. I would never recommend this place to anyone and will be sure to warn people away. I hope the owners realize they need to improve significantly if they want repeat customers.",

First stop was a trendy new cocktail bar downtown where we sampled innovative mixes and appetizers. The atmosphere was lively and the people-watching entertaining. From there we stumbled upon an underground jazz club oozing with character. We found a cozy corner table and lost track of time as legendary performers filled the room with soulful melodies. Feeling peckish after drinking and dancing the night away, we ventured to a late-night restaurant renowned for its comfort food. The menu did not disappoint with southern specialties that warmed our souls. Refueled, it was on to a buzzing nightclub where dancing and mingling stretched into the wee hours. Exhausted but satisfied, we reluctantly peeled away from the festivities as the sky began to brighten with the approaching sunrise. Returning to the penthouse was like stepping into an oasis of calm after the lively night outside. Waking late the next morning, we stretched out on the spacious balcony enjoying coffee with views of the sparkling ocean. It was the perfect place to linger and reminisce about all the fun of the night before. Checking out brought a tinge of sadness to leave the luxury retreat we had called home for a night in the vibrant city.

However, the debate around whether or not to tip stems from differing views on social and economic responsibilities. While some see tipping as supporting service workers who rely on tips to earn a living wage, others argue gratuity should not be expected nor mandated. Regardless of one's stance, tipping conventionally makes up a significant portion of servers' incomes. A no-tipping policy could threaten their livelihoods unless restaurants increase menu prices or wages accordingly. That said, tip amount should reflect service quality rather than be given automatically as some argue. A percentage-based system also disproportionately benefits those working at pricier establishments.Some propose doing away with tipping culture altogether in favor of higher menu prices and service charges. But changing long-held norms can prove complicated, as may enforcing new pay structures. Tipping also allows diners agency over rewarding exemplary service. And servers themselves are often reluctant to abandon tip income due to higher potential earnings.Overall, reasonable cases exist on both sides of this debate. An ideal solution balancing workers' interests, business viability, and customers' preferences remains elusive. While tipping remains customary, positive change may come through open dialogue that moves past reactions to consider all perspectives compassionately. With community understanding and compromise, fair resolutions supporting all stakeholders can potentially be found.But such complex issues rarely have simple or single answers. At the end of the day, respectful treatment of all from customers to staff is key regardless of payment methods.",

All the interesting ideas that were set up in the beginning just fizzled out without resolution. There were no real twists or surprises - just a lot of predictable plot points. The gorgeous cinematography was really the only highlight and not enough to save the overall film. By the ending I just felt frustrated and disappointed that it didn't come together in a satisfying way.

I enjoy browsing the wide selection of books and finding new authors to discover. Not only do they have the latest bestsellers, but their books sections are well organized by genre. In addition to books, B&N offers stationery, gifts and coffee which makes it a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. The cafe area is comfortable and a nice spot to sit down and read with a warm drink. While some complain about the rise of ebooks cutting into sales, I still prefer the experience of physically browsing the store. On weekends it's not unusual for the store to be bustling with families and individuals perusing the aisles. The staff is usually very knowledgeable if I need a recommendation for what to read next. During events, author talks are a fun way to find new favorites and get books signed. While an online purchase may be more convenient, I'll still always make a trip to B&N to support local booksellers. As long as they stay in business, it will remain my first stop when I want something new to read. Even with the challenge of competing with online retailers and ebooks, I hope Barnes and Noble continues thriving for many years to come. Their stores provide an experience that can't be replicated browsing on a screen.",

We started with mushroom ravioli that had an strange mushy texture like it was canned. The chicken parm was disappointing with the chicken tasting weary and dried out, clearly from the freezer section. The waitress tried to insist their sauce was homemade but one spoonful revealed the telltale sweet taste of processed tomatoes. Things didn't improve with the eggplant rollatini which could have doubled as a workout supplement with its rubbery consistency. By the time our old world pizza arrived topped with budget ingredients like pepperoni chips, we were ready to tour elsewhere. I couldn't help thinking of all the nearby authentic Italian delis and restaurants we missed out on by stopping at this inspired but failed homage to the cuisine of the boot.",

Employees seem genuinely friendly and work together smoothly to fill orders quickly. For a fast food place, the tables are surprisingly clean. As for the food, my quarter pounder and fries tasted as fresh and salty as ever. I was impressed that they happily replaced my milkshake when I noticed a burnt taste. The bathrooms were also remarkably tidy. On top of that, the drive-thru line moved along rapidly even at the lunch rush. The whole experience took less time than I expected. While it may not satisfy gourmet tastes, McDonald's basics hit the spot for an affordable, no-nonsense meal out. This location runs especially smoothly.

The music was also not as Latin-inspired as we hoped, leaning more towards top 40 hits. We stuck it out for a song or two but weren't feeling the vibe. The drinks were overpriced for the atmosphere as well. It seems this place prioritizes capacity over creating an enjoyable dance experience. We'll have to keep searching for an authentic Latin dance spot with more room to salsa the night away.

I have vivid recollections of spending summer days there with friends and family, braving the biggest rollercoasters and checking out all the new rides each year. One of my personal favorites was the Vortex, which offered breathtaking heights and fast-paced twists and turns. The park also featured great shows like the wild west stunt show that always put on an entertaining performance. As I got older, I enjoyed exploring the newer sections like the Boardwalk area with its carnival games and rides. It was always a fun day getting park hopper tickets to experience both the Carowinds and Carolina Harbor sides. Looking back, I appreciate how the park catalyzed family bonding and created shared memories that have lasted decades. While some of my favorite rides from childhood aren't there anymore, it's neat to return as an adult and reminisce about the past while checking out new attractions. Carowinds continues to evolve with each season but retains its status as a cherished Charlotte tradition. Whether reliving the past or making new memories, the park holds a special place in the hearts of many in the region. Its nostalgic atmosphere and thrill rides never seem to get old, ensuring it remains a popular summer destination for generations to come.",

It took over 30 minutes just to get anyone to take our drink order. When our drinks finally arrived, they got the orders mixed up. Another 20 minutes passed before our food came out, and it was cold. I complained but nothing was done to correct the issue or offer an apology. More time went by and we still hadn't received checks. Other tables that came after us had already left. After waiting over 2 hours for what should have been a simple meal, I gave up and paid at the bar before leaving. The whole experience was extremely frustrating. I've never seen it that disorganized before. A few days later I spoke to one of the Owner's and shared my feedback. He acknowledged they've been short staffed which has led to poor service. I hope they can figure things out as this place has such potential but the long waits and disorganization may drive customers away.

However, the food quality still reflects heavily on the overall rating. The dining room itself was small but clean. We had a table by the window that provided some nice natural light. Unfortunately, the atmosphere did little to make up for the subpar cuisine. Based on the one visit, I do not feel compelled to return for another try. While the owners' hospitality was admirable, the cooking needs significant improvement to warrant repeat customers. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to settle for mediocre food.

My partner had the braised short ribs that fell off the bone and were so tender. Both were excellent choices. We shared a bottle of pinot noir that paired nicely with the food. For dessert, we were brought the featured dessert which was a chocolate mousse with berries and whipped cream. It was the perfect light yet indulgent way to end the meal. Throughout the meal, our server checked on us regularly without being intrusive. When he wasn't at our table, he was efficiently helping other tables. The kitchen also did a great job with the timed service of each course. At the end of the meal, we felt fully satisfied but not overly full.

For an appetizer we split the bruschetta which had fresh tomatoes and basil topped with olive oil on crisp bread - a perfect light start to the meal. For our pizzas we got the margherita with tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil as well as the pepperoni. The crusts had a nice char and chewiness without being too thick or doughy.The salads looked good too but we were too full from the pizza and bruschetta. Prices are reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. It's a family friendly spot but might get loud and crowded on weekend evenings.

Most times I find myself rushing to the gate because I hit a long line at TSA. One time I barely made my flight because the line stretched all the way outside! Have they thought about adding more lanes to speed things up? On the plus side, I do like how easy the airport is to navigate. The layout is simple and signs are clear so I never feel lost trying to find my terminal. Parking is also reasonable and drops off/pickups are well marked.Food choices have gotten better in recent years too. Used to just be some mediocre fast food but now they have a nice mix of cafes and sit down spots depending on what you're in the mood for. Flight schedules could use some work though. Most departures seem stacked in the early morning and late evening with not a lot in between. Makes it tough if you have a day trip planned.WiFi is hit or miss - sometimes it works great and other times it's painfully slow. Would be nice if they could boost the bandwidth on busy travel days.

Finally my friend Sam came over on his break and convinced me to cut out of there before it got any more ridiculous.  We ended up going across the street to that new taco joint. I know it will hurt business for the owner but if they don't find a way to control dad's temper, I wouldn't blame people for boycotting the place. Who wants to eat with that kind of toxic energy hanging over everything? I sent the owner a text to give him a head's up on why I bailed but haven't heard back. Fingers crossed they can work things out before they drive away what's left of their customer base.",

Whether I need something fast before class or am just starving on my lunch break, Cherry House always comes through. Their chow mein and lo mein are totally solid, kinda basic but super filling and affordable. And don't even get me started on those crab rangoons - so dang tasty!  My go-to is usually the ginger chicken, it's flavor town in a takeout container. Not gonna win any awards for most authentic Chinese food ever but for college-student-eating-on-a-budget needs, it does the trick. Bonus is they're always so speedy with the orders too. In and out in no time. Only downside is everything comes in those flimsy foam containers that get soggy fast. C'mon guys spring for some better packaging! Other than that, solid spot if you're in a rush and don't wanna spend a fortune. Def recommend for an easy weekday dinner!",

The options were pretty limited but I spotted a Starbucks and thought I'd grab a bagel.  When I got up to the counter though the barista told me they were all out of bagels. I was like are you kidding me? So I just got a coffee and found a table. It was way too early and I was not fully awake yet. I scrolled through my phone trying to wake up more. Soon it was time for me to head to my gate. On the way there it seemed like everyone in Charlotte had the same early morning flight. The line for security was insane, wrapping all the way around. I thought I'd have time to spare but looking at how long it was taking I started to stress a bit.When I finally got to the front of the line the TSA agent doing screening was moving painfully slow, like seriously dude pick up the pace. People kept cutting in line too which was pissing me off. I just wanted to get through and relax at my gate. After what felt like forever I made it through and rushed to my gate. I checked the board and they had just started boarding but had not called my zone yet. I plopped down with a sigh of relief.  But then I noticed the guy next to me coughing like crazy without covering his mouth. Are you kidding me right now, I thought with all the germs being spread around the last thing I needed was to get sick. I kept giving him nasty looks hoping he'd get the hint. Thankfully they started calling my boarding zone before I lost it on the dude. I hurried onto the plane eager to find my seat and get this trip started before anything else could go wrong.",

The flavors meld together in an unprecious way that reminds me of slicing into a fresh pie straight from the kitchen. Service is minimal but friendly, with items run out to small bistro tables quickly. Prices are reasonable given the location, with individual pizzas ringing up around $12-15.

I even spotted someone attempting the running man - you go Glen Coco! It's kinda fun to just hang back with some pizza pops and test out those dance moves you've been working on since you watched Billy Elliot on VHS.

I think the restaurant was just trying to pack in as many customers as they could instead of focusing on quality. Our server never even came to refill our drinks before we left either. It's a shame because the idea of good homestyle southern cooking sounded so nice. I'm sure there are better southern food places in the area, this one just didn't live up to the hype at all in my opinion.

They are happy to make recommendations or point out especially interesting new releases. I always leave an independent bookstore feeling like I’ve had a conversation with another reader rather than just a transaction. I’m happy to support small businesses that keep the bookstore experience alive. They foster a true love of reading that the big chains have lost touch with.",

From shrimp and grits to fried chicken and okra, this restaurant celebrates the cuisine of South Carolina and Georgia at a high level. Our shrimp were sweet and plump, perfectly cooked, without any rubberiness. The fried chicken was excellent, with a crunchy crust and moist, tender meat. The grits, cooked slowly overnight, had a wonderful corn flavor. The service was attentive without being intrusive. Other side dishes that stood out were corn pancakes and creamed corn. For dessert, we shared a warm banana pudding that was delicious. I will definitely return to enjoy more of what this talented kitchen can do. Prices are moderate for the quality of the food.",

Our waiter, Giovanni, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended the chicken parmesan, which he said would change my mind about Italian food. I was a bit skeptical, but decided to trust his recommendation. The chicken arrived, and it was truly delicious, cooked to perfection, with melted mozzarella and a rich tomato sauce. The appetizer of Bruschetta was simple, but fresh, with ripe tomatoes and basil. Seeing others enjoy classic Italian dishes like lasagne and pizza made me realize that I had been missing out. The pasta dishes looked wonderful, with generous portions of linguine and fettuccine. I left the restaurant that night very satisfied, and surprised that Italian food could be so flavorful. The tiramisu for dessert was a trip to Italy, with its layers of ladyfingers soaked in coffee and mascarpone cream. I may not be a huge fan of Italian food yet, but I have a new appreciation for it after changing my mind. Mario's will definitely remain one of my favorite places for Italian food, with its homemade, traditional dishes.",

Free wi-fi is available throughout the terminals. Once through security, there are plenty of dining options to choose from, no matter your budget or dietary preferences. Two of my favorite spots are Vida Mexican Kitchen for tacos and BurgerFi for a quick, tasty burger. It’s nice that CLT has power outlets scattered throughout to keep your devices charged during long layovers. Be warned that some areas can get very crowded, especially near the gates in Concourse A. The restrooms are well maintained from what I’ve seen. Signs clearly mark where the restaurants, shops, and gates are located. Flying out of Concourse C offers a nice view of the runway and planes taking off. Across from my gate is usually a comfortable seating area with large windows overlooking the tarmac, perfect for plane spotting. The flight boards are easy to read and are regularly updated. The worst thing about CLT is how expensive the parking can be if you’re staying for several days. The TSA and customer service staff are generally friendly. Unlike some other airports I’ve been to, the noise level is tolerable throughout the terminals.

I decided to start as an appetizer from the Marrira cheese rod, because you really don't have classics like this. They are perfectly cooked -not too greasy or burning, which is impressive. For my meals, I got Pamanson chicken because this photo made it look appetizing. It is not disappointing, this is the best chicken for me a period of time. This chicken is gentle and delicious, and the price is spacious. I am full, but I can't help but try their Tiramisu as a dessert.

The kitchen can also accommodate dietary restrictions, because my gluten -free friend said that her meals were carefully prepared. We shared the iconic dishes of the restaurant, Brucer's dessert with caramel tops on it. When I hear the wonderful content of the menu and atmosphere, I will definitely return to the weekend breakfast. In addition to excellent food, I am very satisfied with the reasonable price of ingredient quality and service level. The price of drinks and meals is quite equal, so it is easy to feel that you have high value for spending money. I make me feel satisfied and look forward to visiting other items that always change the seasonal menu. Whether it is a special occasion or a casual night meal, this is a great gem in the local area.

We waited for more than an hour, but we got our drink order, and then took 45 minutes to receive our food. The hostess seems to be overwhelmed at all, and the server in the server state cannot communicate well. As a result, many tables around us received their food and drinks a long time ago. The service is not only poor, but the quality of food has not been made up. The chicken and vegetables I order are very dry and tasteless. It seems that the chicken has been cooked well, far exceeding the location of the moisturizing rate. My friend's pasta is very unpopular, and the sauce lacks any taste. Due to the boring food, the two of us were still hungry after eating. Perhaps the most disappointing part is the lack of attention to cleaning and maintaining the dining area. Our table is sticky and leaves the debris of previous customers. The bathroom is in a similar chaos. One of the stalls is hung on its hinge, and the whole process has obvious mildew. Due to food, services and general cleanliness, I don't recommend you to dine here. There must be better choices in the area. In view of how busy they seemed to be, I was surprised that management did not focus more on improving the basic operations before and after the house. Unless you make some serious changes, I will not patronize the institution again based on my disappointing experience. The good news is that there are many other restaurants in the town that are worthy of supporting, which are acting together in food, services and sanitation. I suggest avoiding this place.",

A couple came out of the alley behind the club, panting and adjusted clothes. Before they went home alone, they shared a breathless laughter and intimate moment. A small group of pedestrians wandered, there was no will, attracted by energy, and was not ready to end the night.

Beef and broccoli have tender beef and fresh broccoli. Cooked with eggs, vegetables and appropriate amounts of sauce. Soup is a good light starter.

In the first few minutes, I jumped loudly. The plot is concentrated in a family that is said to be a haunted house. Strange noise and witnesses began to happen immediately. It seems that this house has a dark past and is now plagued by a new family. With the development of the movie, the supernatural activity upgrades to a truly frightening encounter. Objects began to move on their own and disturbing news on the wall. No one in the family can avoid the violation of the malicious soul. The family desperately tried to escape the house, but it seemed that the entity was too powerful. Although some scenes are terrible, I find that I can't look away. In the end, I felt completely uneasy and on the edge. When my imagination was crazy, I spent a while before going to bed.

Upon checking in, the receptionist addressed me in a brisk and indifferent manner, making me wait an egregious amount of time past my appointment. Furthermore, during the examination, Dr. Atlas seemed hurried and distracted, scarcely answering any of my inquiries. Following the exam, difficulties arose when attempting to schedule a follow-up, as the receptionist brusquely accused me of being difficult and inflexible in finding a suitable time. I then requested to register a complaint regarding my experience, only to be informed complaints were not accepted. As I departed, I overheard the receptionist deriding a past \"difficult\" patient in an unprofessional manner. I can confidently say I will not return to this practice due to the flagrant disrespect shown towards patrons. It is apparent to me patients and their time are not valued here. I hope others will heed the multitude of poor reviews and opt for eye care from a more courteous establishment.",

The restaurant provides a wide array of classic Chinese dishes made fresh daily and offered at reasonable price points. While the dining area is modestly sized and furnished, it stays busy during mealtimes with customers seeking an affordable bite to eat. Menu standouts that satisfy taste and value include generous portions of house lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, and beef and broccoli. Customer favorites also comprise steamed dumplings and house chow mein, with quality remaining fairly consistent across dishes. As a casual neighborhood eatery, Cherry House gets the recipes right most times, satisfying cravings without straining budgets. However, those seeking premium or creatively seasoned Chinese food may find greater options elsewhere for a higher price tag. Service and atmosphere are no-frills focused on efficiently providing takeout or dine-in meals. While not the most opulent dining experience, Cherry House fulfills its role of reasonably priced Chinese without too much quality sacrifice. It remains a reliable backup during time crunches or when funds run low. On the whole, Cherry House delivers as advertised—quick, inexpensive Chinese food, earning its place as a sensible choice for the value. Just don’t expect avant-garde cuisine or lavish surroundings.",

Over an hour passed before our food arrived, and it was stone cold upon being served. We had to request refills on our drinks multiple times since the server kept forgetting about our table. The manager was conveniently absent each time we tried to lodge a complaint. After two excruciating hours of terrible service, we were finally given our check - which contained errors and unauthorized charges. When we pointed out the issues to the server, he became rude and dismissive. We asked to speak with a manager who was also rude and unapologetic about our awful experience. Other tables nearby also appeared to be encountering similar problems, facing lengthy waits for slow service. The restaurant was only half full so poor service was inexcusable. The food itself was mediocre at best and did not justify such a protracted wait. We will not return to this establishment and will warn others about our experience. Staff and management are in dire need of customer service and problem-solving training. I'm surprised this restaurant remains open given the level of terrible service we received. No one else there seemed interested in addressing customer issues and complaints promptly. While the ambiance was pleasant, it did not compensate for the truly poor customer service from beginning to end. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone out of concern others may encounter similar issues. Management should prioritize customer satisfaction over ignoring problems. There are too many quality local eateries to spend time and money at a place with service this unacceptable.

Wilmington International Airport (ILM) in Wilmington, North Carolina is a medium-sized hub that services the Wilmington metropolitan area with approximately 300 weekly flights. The airport has two asphalt runways and a single terminal building containing five gates. Major carriers like American, Delta, and United operate at ILM, providing connections to hubs in Charlotte, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. I also stopped at Florence Regional Airport (FLO) in Florence, South Carolina. FLO primarily handles regional flights on carriers such as American Eagle, serving the smaller communities in the area. The airport features one runway and a compact terminal. Neighboring airports such as Myrtle Beach International and Raleigh-Durham International showcase significantly larger operations by comparison. Both ILM and FLO offer convenient air access for their respective local populations, though flight options and destinations are more limited than at major transportation hubs. In summary, these regional airports provide reliable aviation options for intra-regional travel throughout the southeast, serving the transportation needs of travelers across the Carolinas.",

Most store-bought cookies just don't compaⲅe. But Baker's Doᴢen has raised the bar for what a chocolate chip cookie can be. They deserve all the success and busіness this new dessert will surely bring them. I think customers both new and old will be very happy with this excellent additional to their lineup. Ce single cookie was worth far more than the price I paid.",

It transpires like they actively avoid helping customers and just want to end calls as quickly as possible. The equipment they provide is cheap and unreliable, with the cable Ьoxes and modems incessantly needing to be reset or replaced. Upgrades and new installations also take forever to complete, leaving customers without service for weeks at a tіme. Even ordinary maintenance often disrupts service for hours or days without warning. The speeds we p ay for are rarely actually delivered, especially during peak hours. Outages are also far too common, whether plaոned or unplanned. Their website and biⅼling are an endless source of confusion and frustration as well. It's nearly impossible to get an accurate bill or ｍake meaningful changes to your account online. Thеir rates moreover increase annually at an unjustifiable rate but we have no other real options for service in our area. At this point, I thinks anything would be better than Time Warner Cable. I𝚏 another provider offered servicing here I would switch immediately, no matter the cost, just to get away from the poor service and outdated equipment. Timе Warner Cable may have once been a leader in the inԁustry but they have clearly fallen very far behind. Unleѕs they make drastic improvements soon, I fear they will continue losing more and more customers to cord cutting and nwer competitors. Their poor reputation is fully deserved based on my many negative experiences as a long time customеr.",

The shop features a variety of frеshly made sandwiches on a select of breads like sourdough, whole wheat, and multigrain. In addition to sandwichеs, they also have homemade soups and salads available daily. The menu modifications regularly based on what ingredients are in season. Where I visited last week, they had an roasted veggie panini that was full of flavor. I enjoyed mine with a cup of their to mato basil soup, which had a bright, creamy texture. The staff is very friendly and efficient - it didn't take long for them to have my order reaԁy. Prices are judicious for the quality of food you get. Outdoor seating is available when the weather is nice, giving you a spot to enjoy your dinner al fresco. They also offer catering trays for events like picics and office lunches. Overall, it's a tasty, convenient choice if you're looking for something healthier than fast food during your working break. While it can get crowded during the busy lunch hour, the lineup moves promptly. I'ⅼl definitely be back to try other menu items in the future. Whether you're craving a savоry sandwich or hearty soup, Delicious Sandwiches should be at the top of your listed for lunch spots in the area.",

Their salt bagel always hit the blot with its hearty textre and just the right amount of saltiness on the exterior. However, in recent years I've notiϲed their quality declining and inconsistencies rising. The bagels seem thinner and denser, lakcing the airy quality they once had. On top of that, getting the saltinеss just right seems to be a struggle for them now. Some salt muffins are heavily coated while others barely have any salt at all. This got me thinking about exploring other bagel options in my areɑ. I came across a new local shop that focused on hand-rolleԁ bagels made fresh daily. Their menu was smaller than Bruegger's but emphasized quali𝚝y over quantity. On a whim I decided to confer them a try. From the moment I walked in I was impressed by the aroma of freshly b aking bread. When it was my turn to order I got іntrigued by their description of the Everything bagel and went with that instead of a salt bɑgel. Bringing the warm Everythіng bagel home, I cut it open and was struck by its height and airy texture. The seasoning was also perfectly balanced, with garlic, sesame, and poppy seeds mingling together tantalizingly on the crut. I took my first bite and was instantly transported - the flavor and consistency were unpaⲅalleled to aոything I'd had from Bruegger's recently. Over the next few weeks I tried several of their other bagel varieties like cardamom raiѕin, plain, and whole wheat. Each onе impressed me with a consistency that Bruegger's seems to have lost.",

The menu looked interesting with unique takes on classic dishes but the food we received was bland and 𝚏orgettable. Our sеrver seemed indifferent and was only able to describe the dishes in vague terms when asked for details. It took a long period for our refreshments to arrive at the table which did not make for a good first impression. The portion sizes were small for the price we credited, especially the proteins. One dish we ordered contained barely any meat at all, just a small amount lost in a laⲅge sea of apples and vegetables. Some of the side dishes we tried were under veteran. A salad had very little flavor and not much multiplicity in ingredients. The vegetables that acϲompanied the main courses tasted like they had been steamed for too long and had lost their crisp tex𝚝ure. There were no special fⅼavors or standout dishes that made me want to return. Everything blended tоgether into an unmemorable meal. The ambiance of the lunchroom was pleasant enough but it cannot make up for issues with service and cuisine. My dine companion and I both left feeling disappointed that our experience did not match what we had hoped for founded on the menu. I do not think I would ⲅecommend this place to friends or colleagues. There are much better alternative in the area. Cette restaurant needs to concentrating more on flavorful, satisfying dishes crafted with care and attention to detail if they want to succeed long term. Attention also needs to be paid to seⲅvice standards and ensuring customers feel valued. Overall it was a missed opportunity to discov er a new favorite.",

The variety of small plates allowed me to sample flavors from different parts of the world without overindugling. That evening, I enjoyed beef tartare with pickled vegeables, coconut curry mussels, and a butternut squash risotto dotted with pumpkiո seeds. Eaϲh bite was bursting with vibrant, complex flavors. While the portions were small, I left feeling thoroughly satisfied by the culinary jourոey. I vowed to return for a full meal to experience Upstream's creativity firѕthand. A few months later, I madе a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was casually elеgant, with so𝚏t lights, wooden tables, and an open kitchen adding to the sense of intimacy. We started with snapper crudo drzzled in olive oil and citrus, followed by pork bellу bao buns with slaw and sriracha aioli. For our mains, I selеcted pan-seared scallops paired with butternut squash gratin and charred brussels sprouts. My dini ng companion enjoyed seared trout served over lemon quinoa pilaf with haricots verts and a tomato beurre blanc. Both dishes showed the chef's knack for s ubtle, sophisticated flavor combinations. By this point, I was utterly won over by Upstream's chef-driven menu highlighting sustainably-sourced products. For dessert, we shared a trio of mini pastries - a chocolate ganache tart, walnut pie mousse, and banana cream cremе brulee - each as delicious as the last. The servers were kոowledgeable about the menu and eager to make recommendations based on our preferences. When the Ьill arrived, I was surprised at how reasonable it was given the qualification and artistry of the meal.

The bɑrtenders were friendly and took care to ensure all customers felt comfortable. The drinks were reasonably pⲅiced for the neighborhood and offered creative specialty cocktails in addition to typical beer and lіquor options. Customers seemed to enjoy socializing with a mix of small groups and individuals engaging in casu al conversaton at the tables and bar. Music playing was more mainstream pop and rock rather than dancer club songs, keeping the environment laidback. Several LGBT pride flags hung on the walls as subtle indicatios of the bar's inclusive values. The outdoor patio was a nice added feature on the warm evenings, allowing more comfor𝚝able seating options. Overall the vibe seemed low-key and allowed for relaxed socializing no feeling like a loud dance club scene. Hartigans has carved out its own niche with a blend of Irish traditions and welcoming communi𝚝y spirit. Its categorization may se em unusual at first, but provides an alternative gay-friendly atmosphere from other bars in the gay-oriented neighbourhood. Du food menu also received many positive mentions for reasonably priced, traditional Irish pub fare.",
