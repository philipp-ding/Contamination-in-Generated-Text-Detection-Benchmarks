I remembered the day when my fusion-jet had flown into the portal. In hindsight, it probably was n' t the absolute best idea to fly a 20 billion dollar aircraft into a portal on a dare, but then again, Private u/Thomas_633 and Mechanised Private A1-R1 tended not to be the individuals to turn down such a proposition, even if Mainframe 43-RC9 was at 48 % of structual failure ( most were repaired at 20 %, and I really should have repaired the Sabrina earlier ) and it was a totally unknown sector. *Warning: C. 7/F-4 \" Sabrina \" mainframe at 74 % damage! We' re going to crash you dumb fu-* A torrent of swear words erupted from my mechanical colleague and I as the battered exploration craft fell from the sky, the blue droptail screaming and flickering out due to the fact we were a number of lightyears away so many it required exponential notation, and that the Sabrina was n' t designed for portals anyways, that' s why the Akira parent aircraft existed you idiot. My flashback finished, I returned to Robyn. Her blue fin trembled in the night-time breeze. Two more assaults, and I' d be able to afford repairs to the mainframe and return home.",

After the paperwork, the heads come off and get swapped around. I' ve done it dozens of times. It' s perfectly harmless. It feels like selling a car, except you are NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE A TEST DRIVE. I show them the whole thing, even pop the hood if they ask. I' m always in perfect shape. It' s not my fault if they don' t maintain it off the lot. Hell, the guy I just sold to is on his third switch. Repeat customers are my best business. If they can just buy a new body, why would they ever put down a fork? They' ll never quite get to the same level as I am, like you can never wear clothes as good as the magazine model. They' ll never get the face right like I do. But it sells the body, just like the magazines do. Just like my insanely attractive assistants do. ( I have assistants of both genders, I would n' t want to alienate an entire market. ) Just walk in to the meeting. Smile my whitest smile. Nod to the girls ( or boys ). This could be your life. Everything changes when you' re pretty. I' ve had very few people refuse. Then I take the body they switch me, and diet and exercise it down ( or up ) to a sellable figure. Nobody is too far gone to flip, they just pay extra up front. In case of surgery for loose skin. It' s the only thing that really changes the price. Well, that and package size. I have had to charge a few guys extra to trade up. It' s a hit to morale to trade down. One guy got a discount. I almost felt bad letting that body go. But it' s what I do.",

She still feels you watching her, and she hopes she seems brave. She tries to steady her hands, straighten her back though she' s hunched at the waist in hiding. Did you see what she said to that soldier? She wonders. Did you understand that she tried? There had been so little time to think of what to say. Alice had simply heard the blast and some screams. She did n' t even hear Danny' s voice above the din, though she knew it was there just as she knew his silence once things settled. She just started screaming at Danny' s troopmate to leave. She tried to sound as mean as she could, hoping it would save him from trying to save her. It worked and he ran. That was n' t the first time she sensed you there, but it was the strongest. She could see you in her mind' s eye, clutching your page for a moment as you caught your breath. Such a boy, she thinks now as she pictures the soldier' s scrawny limbs skittering back to the fray. All of them boys, like our little Danny. You' re a boy too, she suddenly realizes. You' re scared like them, wherever you are. You' re counting on a happy ending to distract you from the explosions in your head. Alice looks up at the sky, trying to see you though she knows you are no god. She knows there is no heaven for you, but that you exist between the lines of her life and honestly she prefers it that way.",

I did n' t know why or how long it would take, but I knew it was happening. And Mathew: it seemed like he never wanted to hang out anymore. Fast forward to a month later. Mathew was having his Bar Mitzvah and I was n' t invited. He was becoming a man, meanwhile I was slowly fading into non-existence. That' s when it happened actually - when I disappeared entirely. That afternoon, during his Bar Mitzvah. At that point, I was little more than a faintly skin-colored cloud of vapor. I could n' t feel anything, and it was nearly impossible to talk.

The only thing on the menu is the word: *Kebab. * Followed by *£5. 99. * Strange, chintzy-yet-enchanting music plays from a radio, behind the shop counter. I wonder where it' s from? Turkey, I guess.

I haven't really been disappointed yet! The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7). The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends. The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked). The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it. The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees. nnOh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy! And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16). nnPrices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it. nnP. S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try! nn-------------------------nUpdate 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch. What a great deal! For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree. They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff! The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion. The truffled potato was yummy. The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!

It might be important to note I'd had a huge curry craving for months. Maharani, while it definitely hit the spot, was lacking in a few areas. nnI called in the order and then went to pick it up. It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous. nnI tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case! ). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to. nnLike I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you.",

He was a tall man. Gaunt with age. Garbed in the robe of a supplicant with head shorn he lacked identifying features. But his hands were calloused and spoke of manual labor.

An act neither evil nor good but merely convenient. \" I can not heal a great soul by slaying a damned one. Those accounts do not balance. To save a great soul a great soul must be slain.

I pretended to be asleep and noticed how he suspiciously watched me as he took a small water bottle out of his back pack filled with a glowing neon pink fluid. He put the bottle in the fridge and started shuffling through the drawers like he was desperately looking for something. He kept looking at me every few seconds so I kept my eyes closed to avoid detection and within a few minutes I hard the door slam. I quickly rose from my bed, throwing the covers off my body and moved towards the fridge in the dark room. Just before I reached the fridge he stepped out of the dark corner towards me. He had n' t left. He looked at me with a blank stare. \" Thought you were sleeping. \" He said calmly. \" I heard the door slam it woke me up \" I said. A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face.

Long ago left behind. Time seemed to slow. A figure of a dashing, good looking man appeared in front of him. He looked something like those old Greek statues. Smiling, he offered down his hand. I accepted and he pulled me to my feet. \"I want you to be my paladin. \"I blinked. \"Your what? Like the thing from D & D. You' re joking, right? \"An aura surrounded him, as though he was glowing with sunlight from the inside. \"Absolutely not. Now that most people are dead, prayers can be heard once again. \"I looked at the zombies, they were still moving, although incredibly slowly. It was do or die. I nodded. \"What do I do? \"He pointed at the whip. \"Just find out. \"Real time resumed. I brought up the whip and cracked it. Black lighting slithered out from it, searing the tops of the tanker and dozens of the zombies went down with the blow. Laughing and filling full of this newfound power, this endless ocean pouring through me, I started cracking the whip again and again. I look around, laughing and breathless. No more zombies. I can do it, I told myself, I can save everyone who' s left. I just have to find them. \"Thank you! \" The god appeared again, still smirking.",

Everyone had told me I was the most powerful wizard they' d ever met, my cloak dyed with so many patches of color they bled together, and I was about to be flayed alive by the giant manticore skittering after me. With everyone watching. I chanced a glance up at the crowd peering over the side like I was a caged animal, cheering \" Marissa! Marissa! Marissa! \" in time with my pounding feet. What kind of idiot gave a test that blocked magic, to prove you were a good magic wielder? Air burned like fire down my throat but... wait... I could no longer hear the beast. Like a fool I skid to a stop, gasping. I had to get out, I had to get *out*. I tried to climb the slick mud walls, but even with a running start I could only get half way up before I lost purchase. No no no no no... Someone above me screamed, just as the hideous thing burst from the wall, clamping its mighty jaws around my throat. *Snap. * And silence. But I felt a tug, somewhere in the dark. My brothers were counting on me, the only source of protection from this cruel world, my mother so lost to despair from my father' s death she refused to do anything, even as our house fell apart around them. I pictured their faces, Kyrin and Jace. Too young, too sweet. There was a whole other life I wanted to give them with my magic. I could n' t leave. *Get out get out get out* roared in my head, and then it was pouring from my mouth, shaking the walls of my mind and the walls of the maze. The crowd was dead quiet.",

Still blurry eyed from my deep slumber I try to move slow but determined, not too make to much noise, not knowing what I might find. As I make it to the first floor I see a man in a slight silhouette standing outside the door, it' s hard to make out any features.

I fling open the door and just as I am about to tackle him, almost with an unseen sense, he side steps me. Expecting a collision, I stumble and fall face first into the lawn. I quickly turn on my back awaiting the retaliation from the man. As I settle on my back, the man casually steps above me peering down at me. That is when I notice it, it was n' t him that looked familiar, it was my clothes. He appears to be wearing the clothes I slept in.

Prepare. * Six o' clock. Peter turned to his laptop and scoured the Internet. For a moment he felt the brief spark of relief when he couldn' t find a reference this message. And then the dam broke. People from Japan to Australia to Toronto were asking the same question. How? And what did it mean? Some people panicked. Some people sounded overjoyed. The more he read, the more Peter felt a sense of a calm. In ten hours, if this was real, he would be out of his body. It had taken the last six years for him to adjust to his new life. It had taken every second since June 14, 2008 to finally feel even the vaguest sense of ease with how he had to live day to day. But as he watched the message clutter his Twitter page, Peter felt overjoyed. He stared at the corner of the room where his shackles lay dormant. The guilt was one thing. The agony of thinking about the accident everyday was another. But the physical repercussions were just the manifestation of denial. But in ten hours he would be free from the stares. No longer would his family be able to shake their heads and make passive-aggressive comments. He would never have to walk down the stairs and see her cherubic face frozen in time living in the parade of frames against the wall. While the world screamed in terror behind him, Peter got out of bed. In ten hours he would be free. He gripped the edge of the bedside table and reached over for his leg.",

I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11: 00 pm on the dot! nnMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above.

He needed only to slay this king and claim the city for his own. His heart was racing as he took each step. The closure he came the heavier he felt. The sound of drums echoed in his ears. Rum bum bum rum bum bum. His sword swayed at his side. Then he looked upon the large blue doors. He stood in front of them for several seconds, just taking it in. For it had been a long time since his eyes saw these doors. He slowly pushed the doors open and stared right at the throne, and into the eyes of the man who sat upon it. \" I knew you would find your way here eventually, my son. \" \" You were right. I brought an army! \" \" An army that does not belong to you. \" \" They obey me, they take orders from me! \" \" It is safe to say you give orders better than you take them then. \" \" You took my crown from me! \" \" You were not ready to be king! \" The wind slowly blew through the doors causing Peldar' s black cape to twirl. Peldar moved closer and closer to his father drawing his sword a little bit with each step until it was fully unsheathed. \" You realize that this only ends one way. \" His father nodded. Then Peldar thrust his sword into the king' s chest. Blood dripped slowly from the wound. Peldar looked his father in the eyes, and then removed the blade. His father fell to his knees and hugged his son. Peldar immediately pushed him to the ground. Where he laid motionless. Peldar then looked to the white throne in front of him. He sat on the throne, took in a deep breath, and grinned the most evil grin. \"",

Why hadn' t she come to me for help? *Had she tried* coming to me for help and I had not noticed—brushed her off because I was busy? All these questions I couldn' t answer.

Not just \" mature for his age, \" or \" an old soul, \" or whatever. There was no euphemism for it. He looked like he should have a Miata and a mortgage. He looked like he should be worried about his new promotion placing him in a higher tax bracket. Instead, he wore Deadpool t-shirts and drank Mountain Dew: Code Red.",

It judged. It observed as I went about the process. The only thing left for me know. *My* process. I walked into the house. No lights were on. The demon scrutinized my every move. I crept slowly inside, located the stair case and began my climb. At the top of the stairs, I could hear a faint snoring. One bedroom was left open. The demon moved for the first time tonight. He appeared to be contemplating. I crept toward the open bedroom. The knife felt cool, and weighty in my hand. The handle fit perfectly into my palms. I gripped it tight, and tried to look at the demon. As usual, it glided, frustratingly quick, to the corner of my eye. Though it' s face remained impassive, it appeared amused. Ignoring my permanent companion, I crept toward the bed. The snoring was louder, now, a middle aged man, in crumpled sheets, trumpeting horrendously. I leaned over the man, peered into his face, and cursed him. Hate drove me. Hate drove my knife into this strangers chest. I suffer alone. Blood soaked, I looked back at the bedroom. Cries from another room let me know I was not alone. Sirens in the distance let me know it was too late. A drop of blood dripped from the knife, still clutched in my hand.",

I truly understand the concept behind this. But can I be the first to say.. . IT'S NOT CUTE! For the drink menu, fine. I'll admit to having a few laughs at their PG-13 drink encyclopedia. I'm not that cold-hearted. But when I'm hungry, the last thing I want to do is spend 20 minutes trying to decipher what my options are. nnClearly I have a vendetta against their obnoxious menu, but the real problem here is that the food is the definition of mediocre. I go here fairly often, so I've done a lot of hopping around their menu trying to build my go-to order. I still haven't figured it out, and it's at the point where if my friends want to grab food here, I'll make a point out of eating beforehand. Plus, oh WOW is this place overpriced! This was especially highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to $42 for brunch. Not expensive, but the wheels started turning in my head.. . we just paid $42 for an appetizer, two entrees, and two bloodys, all of which were eh, passable. For exactly $6 more, we could have went down the street to Casbah and had TWO appetizers, two entrees, and two much stronger bloodys, all of much higher quality. nnThe reason I still come here though is the drinks. My favorite is the Happy Ending which involves pineapple juice, ginger, and cucumber. You really can't go wrong with anything though except for the Statutory Grape--if the name doesn't dissuade you enough, just heed my advice and don't order it.

I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer. I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.

It looks like a ton of fun! Ah, so I' m Pilgrim, and I have n' t been writing avidly for very long at all. Before I went gung-ho, I dabbled. Every time I ask myself why I write, I get a different answer. Sometimes it' s because I' m bored, like I was yesterday, and I write out of obligation. Sometimes, I' m feeling too much and do n' t know how to handle it, so I just have to get it out and down on the paper. Sometimes It' s because I have something to say. Sometimes it' s because I have nothing to say. Sometimes I' m not sure I care what I' m saying at all, I just like the feeling of words flowing through my fingertips. I would n' t recommend writing out of obligation. It never seems to turn up good results. Yes, you might write every day, and yes, you might meet your word count quota or whatever, but if the writing' s dry and disinterested, it usually means I have to go and live some life to write about later, like how swimmers need to breathe between strokes. I just love WriteMonkey. It' s hands down my favorite program I' ve ever had the pleasure to use when I' m typing prose or poetry, though the tools we use are pretty personal, and I have some weird tastes, so it would n' t surprise me to be on the edge here. There' s a few things I wish it could do, but I do n' t really miss em that much, and what it does do, I have n' t found anywhere else. I also write in my black magic notebook.",

He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself. Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie' s car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I' d taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead. It was n' t the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me. The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I' d cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I' d made the last hour of many men' s lives slightly better. I could n' t imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make. Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up. Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work. -- - Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer' s cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face. He was crying. I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \"",

Craig grabbed his mail, opened his door, and stepped inside. Out he laid the assorted envelopes for careful examination. He first noticed the electricity bill. Overdue. Next came the gas bill. Same case. Craig set them aside. His gaze fell on a postcard, an item which Craig never received. Its contents were handwritten. Its stamp was applied with human hands. Craig kissed it. He knew what it contained. \" Dear Daddy, We are having a great time here in Paris. We just went up the Eiffel Tower and tomorrow we are going to see the Mona Lisa. Wish you were with us! Love, Katy XOX \" Craig set the postcard aside, but in a different stack. His eyes shifted to the final letter. With a quick glimpse of the return address, his eyes dropped. His fingers slowly tore open the envelope from Monroe County Circuit Court and unfolded the letter. Craig' s eyes fell again. A divorce summons. Also overdue. Our hero took all four letters and consolidated them into a single stack, which he chucked into a wastebin. He had a letter of his own to write. \" Dear anyone, I' m sorry. It could have gone a lot better. But it did n' t. Tell Katy I' m sorry, please. Tell her I' m really stupid.

And the other man its newest villain, Blitz Talk, who decided to start his reign of terror only a few days ago. \"I will win this battle, and you won' t be able to tattle. I rise to greatness, as you become nameless! \"Prose yelled out. He immediately felt the power well up inside of himself. Anything that Prose rhymed became the truth. An odd ability, but a powerful one nonetheless. \"I' ll walk away successful and you' ll be regretful. I' ll be the best and you' ll fail your quest. \"Blitz Talk' s words came out rapidly, quickly canceling out Prose' s abilities. The thing was, whenever Blitz Talk rhymed, he could do the same as Prose. But he had to speak faster than Prose, who had to slowly take his time. The two continued to go at it for hours. And then it occurred to Prose what he needed to do to end this battle. \"Stop right there. I just figured out how to make you run out of air. You think your rhymes are so magnificent, but you aren' t all that brilliant. I' m sure your mom said you were special, but when I' m done with you, your tongue will be tied like a pretzel. \"Prose stood victorious as Blitz Talk responded. \"You think you are so great, but you fail to realize that you' ve taken the bait. In my trap you fall, a long nap awaits you all. When I' m through with this town, you will be remembered as only a clown. \"Blitz Talk laughed and laughed. \"Then you leave me no choice, I do what I must. Rhyme the word orange, or you shall combust. You can' t do it can you?",

In short, the compound will be inert as long as you' re on the island. No, \"and here he waved a hand despite Surovec not interrupting, \"I wo n' t tell you what keeps it inert. The antidote might be in the water, or in the soil you' ll be growing your crops in. We might aerosolize it into the air you breathe, or just inject you with it during your annual health inspection.

Be nice to the other inmates; you all grow your own food and make everything you need, so you' ll need to work together to survive. Common sense. Understood? \"Surovec nodded.

The shadow of my spear was clear on the stairs, and it made me feel safe. Not that I would ever have to use it, obviously, but eh. I liked it here. It was... calm. So different from... other places. I planted the spear in the sand, and lay on the sand, arms behind my head, looking at the sky. In the silence, I fell asleep. -- - And then I woke up. A strong wind was whitening the ocean, and lifting droplets of salt water that constantly hit my face. The once blue sky was dark grey, and suffocatingly low. This could mean only one thing: the Beast was coming. The creature I dreaded the most had awoken from its slumber. I had to find shelter. The wind so strong that the boat had been brought on the beach, I started walking toward the shack. But it was too late. A terrible voice called my name, so loud it overcame the wind. \" STHEPEN MACLAKIN! You had a duty! You had sworn to carry it out! \" Terrified, I started running towards the building, my heart racing and pounding, under the pouring rain. As soon as I opened the door, a gush of wind slammed it shut. The voice continued, shattering the skies: \" I told you to DO THE DISHES! \" said the Beast, with voice of thunder. \" But MOOOOM. I do n' t wan na! Five more minutes, PLEEEAAASEEEEE! \" I implored, hopeful. But no, the island started melting away, and the reality of the projecting room filled the empty skies and the clear ocean. \"",

I shall do this one myself. \" The emperor stepped behind the hero, and drew his blade. \" That is what the losers always say you know. To the victor. I am not a good man. I have never claimed to be. But I am a just one, where I can be of course. \" \" Fuck you! \" barked the hero. His throat sore, his arms pinned, legs broken. \" I do n' t expect you to understand. But still I want you to know. I have made an empire, where you would have made chaos. If you would have succeeded millions would have died. I have killed thousands, for the sake of millions. Never forget hero, rulers can be just, but never nice. I have created trade and unity where you would have had lawlessness. Great men, are never good men. Good men stay at home and plow fields, and herd sheep. Great men, do what good men can not. I am not a good man hero, and neither are you or we would not be here. \" The emperor raised his blade then and sliced the head off the dissenter. The rebel, who raised an army to sack the capitol. An army that rode across half his empire and burned and pillaged in its wake, just to kill him. All for uniting a people.",

I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice. My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl. Our food came fast enough and it was served hot. However, my dish was nothing to brag about. It was pretty average tasting Asian fare. It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality. Good thing it was only about 6 bucks. My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles. The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection. Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll. The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all. It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion. The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something. It almost looked like boiled ground beef. I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious. As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars! Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for. I don't understand this either. The rolls were extremely bland and chewy. The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.",

Months, cutting away at a huge block of marble, caressing it as if it was Her own skin I was touching, making love to it, dreaming about it, about Her, about the moment I' ll show it to Her. I carefully carved every fold of robe, every strand of hair. I forgone sleep, I lost weight, I, I, I... there' s barely an \" I \" to talk about after all this time. My friends understood and left me alone after a while. They know of my obsession. Some share it even. Maybe it was the dehydration, maybe the lack of food, but while working I kept seeing Her, feeling Her blessed presence. I knew I was doing the right thing when I quit my job to finish the statue before Her birthday. When the day came, I prepared well for it. I changed my filthy, smelly clothes, I took a purifying shower, I shaved. The statue was already at the temple when I got there. The celebration was just starting, close to midnight, and it would last a full day, or even a day and a half for some. She is loved by many. The big inner yard was full with my brothers and sisters, singing and dancing under flying lanterns. Inside, the priests were preparing for the midnight sermon. My statue was unveiled at the dawn ceremony, the one that marked her birth, the birth of all stars on the sky. We tanked her for the light and for the warmth, and for life itself. As I was chanting Her hymns, one voice lost in thousands, tears streaming down my face, swaying with the crowd, back and forth, back and forth, I heard Her voice in my head, I felt Her presence all around me, in me, filling me with Her endless love: \" That' s nice, dear. \".

The only room they have left to offer me is half a \"parlor\" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. nnI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either. nnOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right? nnI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. nnI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size. nnA pattern develops. nnOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification. He wants to see my id. Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error. What were they were thinking? nnA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time.",

When the scientists found a way to link the biological aging process to our state of contentness, through a complicated process involving neurons and hormones even *they* barely understood, we were too eager. Ironic, that. We rushed to a technology that made rushing deadly. The principle is laughably simple in retrospective. Yet we did not foresee it. Once a person became *too* discontent, the aging process would become visible... tangible, physical. Once such a person feels the fangs of time, gnawing at them, it sends them spiralling into more miscontent, turning their feelings to dread. Turning their bodies to death. I saw it, once, a woman shrivelling up into old age in front of my eyes. I averted my eyes before she died, and thought of happy things. It' s made life like a dance on a tightrope, carefully balancing in what seems like joy and bliss, with an abyss waiting below should we make a single misstep.

She knew every word, she never fluffed a line, she never let anybody down, she was absolutely brilliant. \"She only had to look at me and say: 'Now then Hilda,' and I would be off in fits. She creased me when we had scenes together. I could hardly do the scene for laughing. She had the mobile facial expressions, which said everything. She didn't need to say anything sometimes. You could tell by her face what the character was thinking. \"Every time I had scenes with Betty we had a load of fun and the giggles, and you don't get that all the time when you're working in this business. \"We didn't have any big storylines together - the only time I saw Betty was in the pub, as a rule. Hilda was a cleaner in the pub so I saw Betty quite a lot in there but I don't think we met anywhere else. \"We kept in touch by the phone. When I was in it, we went into Granada every day and did rehearsals. But they don't do that now. They might be somewhere else on location, or they may be in the studio doing half a dozen different scenes, so it's impossible to go and see people. So I didn't see Betty much once the format changed. \"She was a lovely person. I shall miss her very much. We worked well together for a long time. She'll be very much missed by quite a lot of people, not just for the work but for the friendships.",

His face was astonishing, if I did n' t know any better I would say that he was still a boy, it showed no signs of aging whatsoever. His nose seemed to attach itself to the frames of his glasses, and his mustache seemed to attach itself to his nose, and what was startling was that at first glance his nose seemed to be a different pigment in comparison to his skin, and even more startling than that was that he clearly lacked nostrils. His sense of dressing was just as odd, he always wore a trench coat that seemed too large on sleeve length, and rather than wearing formal shoes he seemed to enjoy wearing light up Spider-Man sneakers. The president was a strange man, but he was a good man, which makes this whole ordeal much more tragic. He quickly won the vote of the nation through his campaign to push the agenda of free video games, less school work, and more allowances, he was a truly visionary man. At his final rally he stepped in to the crowd to greet and shake hands with the attendants of the rally, that' s where it all went wrong. A woman, in her excitement to greet the president, tripped, causing her to violently fling forward and collide with the president, ripping his entire mid section clean from his body. This is where the presidents dark secret was uncovered. A small child fell to the ground, unknowing to neither I nor the rest of his agents, the president was bearing a child.",

This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous. I was lucky my computer was not fried. The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu. I then crumpled the menu and threw it away. The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow. I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up. Outrageous. Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers. During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\".",

I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!! nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. nThe food is absolutely amazing!! ! And cheap!! ! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!! ! Homemade dressing at that. nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!! ! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \"unsavories\" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.",

I regretfully inform you that one of the largest cities of the Earth nation the United States of America is scheaduled for total demolishion. As you know we have strong and proud American roots in us. We tried to figure out any other options but the pollution and the toxic waters became too much of an enviornmental threat for our homeworld Earth. And so I regretfully inform you that a total strike of the former city of Los Angeles will be commenced in 4 hours. I want to ensure everybody here that the Americans still living in the states of California and Central San Lencho have been evacuated and are in the Central and Eastern region of the nation. We will be deploying 4 RAH Comanche Cheif Helicopters to carry on the strike. I have talked to the President and she told me that she is on board with the strike by all means necissary. This strike will be quick non-toxic and will mostly scorch a 200 mile radius of the blast site with fire. Once the fire has ended the American government will try to plant new life in the new soil. I want to wish the American people a safe night and send my condolences to anyone who used to live in the once great city. And for my fellow Atlanticites, Man and Woman are here to explore this vast universe that we call our home, but we must also respect those species who lived before we arrived and who will grow after we leave. For if there is one thing mankind relies on it' s the beautiful nature that lives and breathes along with us. Thank you and have a pleasent, safe, and peacefull evening.

They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it. \". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier.. . Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not.",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated.",

It had been almost a year now... a year filled with remarkable growth. Hah! the crazy therapists... would have taken me a lifetime to get this smart & strong. But the occult book has been my saviour. Ever since I learnt to use its techniques on myself, ive gotten smarter and stronger faster and faster.

Frantically, I search my memories, trying to overcome my self-induced forgetfulness. But the freezing this time was absolute...",

        "text": "Desmond was not long for this world, and he knew it. Even now, from the depths of the keep, he could hear the telltale breath of darkness rushing toward the last stronghold of Peloria. The misty whisper chilled the kind prince to the core. It was nothing like the sound his father, King Drasr, had spoken of; even a man on the doorstep of death could not hope to imitate the terror of the faceless voice. The keep would not restrain the darkness for long. It was coming for him, as it had been all his life. The mist had taken the swamps first, leaving nothing but death in its wake. No one knew what to do against such an ethereal foe; the southern border guards, still green from their fathers' wheat fields, trembled and shook as the billowing wall of darkness took town after town by silent force. The farmers of the Midlands had time to arm themselves, but what do you wield to fight an invisible enemy? At least the cattle-raisers and barn-builders died with weapons in their hands and songs in their hearts; the same could not be said of the nobility. They cowered in their keeps, praying to the gods of gluttony and greed for redemption. The mist was more than happy to oblige, casting their lifeless corpses upon the riches they once coveted so dearly. King Drasr fell on the steps of the Durnmeer, overtaken by the misty onslaught. The doors of the massive fortress held for three days against the tide of silence as the king slowly expired. Prince Desmond could still hear his father' s last words, raspy and weak, in his head: \"Flee… You must… outrun the darkness… \"The sandstone walls shuddered around Desmond; the unseen beast had found him. It was only a matter of time now. The kind prince pulled his cloak tight around him, warding off the cold that came just before the nothingness arrived.",

As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend.

Fried rice is super yummy too but is an up charge - $2 I think? (outside of lunch hours) which I think is crazy. Other places in the area don't do this and I think it's just a way for them to make an extra buck. I do pay it though bc I really like the fried rice. Unless you really want an alcoholic beverage save your $$, the beer on tap is often flat and mixed drinks are expensive and nothing that great. I'm not a huge sake fan but it's your average sake. The chefs are so-so, of course they can cook! But I like a show.. . it's hit or miss if you get a good one. They do good for coming out, talking with you, making adjustments, etc. Wait staff is pretty good but there are some bad ones as with all restaurants.

I quickly threw on some clothes and drove to their apartment, the one her and I had shared for 4 years. He greeted me at the door, I brushed passed him and ran upstairs. There she was, swaying back and forth next to the bed I bought, hanging from one of his belts tied around her neck. She looked peaceful, almost happy. Then I saw the note, addressed to me. \" Take my moleskin, read all of it. I never stopped loving you. \" I grabbed her matching moleskin from her nightstand and took off without saying a word to him. I spent all night reading it. She was worse than I am. She said cheating on me was the worst mistake she ever made. He hit her, hard. They both took up drinking as a painkiller. And then I got to the end.... \" I' m ending my life tonight.",

We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke. n2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital. n3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck? My friend's massage included an actual massage. n4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'.

So the only real thing you can try on are coats and shoes. I see people trying shirts and pants on over there clothes sometimes but it proves rather difficult unless they are men.

On saturday it was half off all color tags except red. I found so many items $4 pairs of pants, $3 shirts, $7 jackets.

After somehow making it up the steepest driveway of all time, and somehow stumbling across our rooms in the completely unmarked hallways, we actually found that they were quite nice looking. Felt very much like college dorm rooms - but they were serviceable and clean. nnToo clean - it turns out. After we had barely settled in, my cousin came running into our room screaming like a banshee holding out hands covered in soap. \"IT'S NOT COMING OFF! IT WON'T COME OFF! \" Turns out every single piece of brown furniture in all of our suites was covered with furniture polish that stained our clothes and stuck on our hands. nnWe called the office, and were put on hold for ten minutes. Finally went over across the street, and the staff ended up being very gracious. Apologized profusely, offered to pay to have our clothes cleaned, and removed the guilty furniture from our rooms. Everyone received an apology letter explaining the oversight. We received special attention as the first guests to fall prey to this cruel trick, and received a handwritten apology from the management and two bottles of cheap merlot. nnEverything else went smoothly until check-out day. We were heading to a college graduation ceremony and intended to drive, but were forced to walk due to the Pittsburgh Marathon route. When we called the office to ask if it were okay for us to leave our luggage in our rooms until slightly after check out time (HALF AN HOUR ONLY), they flat out refused to allow it. nnAfter shit-fits were thrown and our varnish-debacle resurrected, they allowed us to leave our cars in the lot with the luggage in the trunks, which they initially tried to refuse permission for us to do.",

Seriously, people get up to them, and then just stand there, like the self check out is some great mystery. nnThe machine is all, \"PLease move item to bagging area? \" and they're all, \"What? What do I do? I don't know, so I'll stand here and stare for 20 minutes! \"nnThey have a wide selection of foods that you won't be able to get to bc I promise a fellow shopper will have their cart right in front of every single item you want. nnIf you enjoy paying $10 for salad, I recommend the salad bar. I've never passed on grape tomatoes bc they were 'too heavy\" before, but that's my fault. I once made an overly enthusiastic salad up and then it was $$$ and I was feeling $ that day. nnOkay, the guy at the cheese counter is awesome. I once told him I needed to bring a cheese plate to a party and asked him to pick out the cheese for me, and it was like he had been waiting all his life for someone to ask him for help. He did put together the most awesome cheese tray ever, and I learned all sorts of facts about Humboldt Fog. Now every time I  walk past he comes out behind the counter and gives me a hug, and at Christmas he gave me a little tiny cheese cutter and then everyone aroudn me was like, \"Wow, how much cheese does that woman buy? \" But seriously, talk to the cheese guy, he is awesome! nnTip:  bring the veggie tray. Dont bring the cheese  tray. The cheese tray is $$$ and people only eat the gouda and the cheddar. nnThey sell beer there now, which is good.",

We were in a large plain that stretched on for miles, and on all sides was surrounded by a tan crest. The plain was homogeneously made up of some form of grain the same color as the edge of the field, and my assailants were nowhere to be seen. When I looked back to where the van had been, all that there was in its place was a black box the size of a dresser. Wondering where they could have gotten to in the time it took to collect myself I walked towards it and around it, realizing that rather then a box, It was an oven.

It' s around noon when I notice something odd on the side of the road: a giant tire. It must' ve been some sort of weird billboard ad. I keep on walking down the road, hoping to see something. I ca n' t. This rain is a total bitch. It' s night time when I notice a sign while climbing some rubble. It' s the seal of Detroit. It says, \" Speramus Meliora. Resurget Cineribus \". I have no idea what that means, so I move along. On the other side of the hill, I see bright lights coming on. They were n' t there the last few nights, and they certainly were n' t there today. I get up and look. It looks nothing like before the Struggle, or even what I was told it looked like after. The GM building it glowing bright. The rubble surrounds houses, like real houses. Then I notice the bridges.",

The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains). I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room. This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason. I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work. I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out. All of the power in the room was then knocked out. This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous. I was lucky my computer was not fried. The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu. I then crumpled the menu and threw it away. The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow. I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up. Outrageous. Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers. During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\". Sorry isn't enough, I'll be trying the Hilton Garden Inn next time.",

He kicked the dirt by his feet, projecting a small pebble -- about the size of a penny, certainly not larger than a nickel -- to the base of the wall. The pebble disappeared in a sea of gray concrete, fortified with steel and wiring atop the miles long barrier of health. The people living in the town contained within were well aware of the disease -- indeed, as was the entire world -- though none care to speak of it. The wall, which quite literally appeared overnight, was proof of their suffering; each mile built another painstaking revelation that their lives were to be confined within this abyss of horror, each gunshot a reminder that someone was attempting to cross the wall into a freedom that would never come. Their lives were medieval, consisting of just enough grain and water to progress through a day before retiring to their small cabins where each member of the town lied awake for hours hoping that they would not be the next to open their eyes in the morning with the deep, guttural cough that indicated death was but three days away. He dropped his cigarette into the dirt and stepped on it with the gentleness of a breeze. He exhaled his last puff of smoke, the buzz not nearly enough to nullify his feelings of uncertainty, and walked back to his cabin. He stepped in, kicking his shoes off at the door, as his daughter ran up and embraced his right leg. \" Daddy, the walls are scary, \" she replied, as had every child of every man who had laboriously constructed the wall the evening before. \" It' s okay, baby.

It was usually only in special cases: a car accident on the I-5 with a 16 wheeler that lost control; an idiot college student deciding he can jump into a pool from three stories up; or a 90 year old man who just suffered his third heart attack and whose wife was wailing in the lobby. She only muttered when the case was going to be close. Her usual routine was to wash up, get gowned, and get to work. Dr. Cardea was the best at only 34 years of age. She always worked calmly, quietly, skillfully and when the job was done it looked as if she had never been there. But on rare days, such as today, the nurse would notice an acrid smell would be lingering in the emergency room as she began her prep. It didn' t matter what case had gone before, or how well the room had been cleaned prior, the smell of decay would be wafting in the southern corner of the room. It was on those days that the nurse knew that her surgeon would break her routine. That she would stare hard into that corner, always the same corner, like she was facing down the death itself. On those days Cardea' s blue eyes would change steely grey, she would mutter words that only I could hear, and then get to work. Today was the same. As Cardea stepped forward to the table, to the newborn babe born a month too early with holes in his heart, she summoned all her skill and prepared to begin. But today was different. The smell was stronger. It was closer. It was surrounding me. At that moment she hesitated. She gave me a glare with such power I felt the need to run from the room in terror. But I didn' t. I simply looked back at her calmly and said \"Let me help you with that Dr. Cardea.",

The Air Force had brought out the worst in him. He did n' t deserve to be saved, yet he had found salvation in painting anyway. Who was he to deny another person this? Another living, breathing human being. And yet the stakes were too high. In the end, that warrior Bob had once been had never truly died. He had simply stepped aside to let the painter flourish. Now that same warrior stepped forward, the paint knife steady in his hand, its surface glimmering titanium white. Adolf Hitler never saw it coming. A river of red danced down the landscape.",

You said that I was enough. I never thought so. I worked myself to death to provide for you and our children. I worked three jobs at one point, do you remember? I got promoted and I finally was able to give you the life that I promised you. The house in France, the yacht, and the mansion. But you left. You had enough of the habits I' ve developed to cope with the stress. The life I gave you imprisoned you. So I drowned in my sorrow. The life I promised you came crashing down around me. I realized that the life I gave you was n' t the life we dreamed of living together. You did n' t fall in love with me because I promised you the world. You did n' t marry me because you knew I would be great one day. You certainly did n' t marry me because of my charms. You married me because we both held the same hope- a hope of a life spent together, to the end. I was never \" good enough \". I was always the greatest part of your life. And you were mine. When you read this letter, my love, I will be no more. It feels like the right thing, even though its so wrong. But its the only way. Since you left, I' ve started to dream again of the life we could have had. The life we could have led if I was n' t so consumed by my greed. Will you still count the falling stars even after I' m gone? Who knows, if I find mercy, I might be looking down at you. I hope this letter will find you well. I' m sorry for the troubles I' ve caused you.",

Another century learning to be something else. It was n' t that he would n' t be treated like a human. That was a problem he had sometimes even when he was in human form. You could never be sure what race to be and when. No, the problem was one that non-shifters never seemed to think about, despite their mythology and fiction regarding the shifter' s people. What they never seemed to get was that thinking was deeply related to shape. The process of becoming a dog was n' t one of taking a human mind into a dog, it was very much becoming a dog. Sure, his level of intelligence would be higher than the average dog, but being smart and being human was n' t the same thing. And that was what weighed on the shiter' s mind. What to spend the next century as? Would he be a dog again and live by the rainbow of smell that filled his brain and the wash of unbound emotion? Or perhaps another century as an eagle. The sight alone was most of the thought process when you lived by the mouse in a field a hundred yards below. Though he had to admit, eagle' s had by far the most interesting sex lives, plunging from the sky in mid coitus. He considered briefly the time he' d spent living as a white predatory fungus deep within a cave. That century had passed as though no time at all had gone by, but he' d wakened with a terribly damaged memory of the time that had come before, and spent most of the next century trying to recreate his deeper self from the fragments. Time was running out. Then he saw it. He checked his phone for flights, and sure enough there was time.",

She loved me. Her hand grabbed mine and the frozen feeling jolted up my arm and shocked me back to reality.

Nothing like the colossal being depicted in great works of art. His bones are glass; he is hollow, he is weak. Our leader, the creator of all things, he is feeble. We are more powerful than he is, now. He tells me of how he got this way. Once, yes, he was capable of striking fear in those who worshipped him. He was strong, he was charming, he was in charge. But not enough worship him to keep him in such a state. Those who call themselves Christians know nothing of his intentions for earth; they weaken him with their sin. God is a husk of what he once was. He is a flower left in the desert. He is nothing at all. He tries to respond to prayers, but so few are worthy of his glorious gifts. The Pope is one of the few he believes are still faithful to him, his prayers are listened to. All leaders of his faith prior spewed lies, led his cherished people to scorn others and condemn those who are different. God does n' t approve of that. Francis understands. He has love in his heart for all things, he tries to steer his followers to the right path. Francis will get a spot by his side in Heaven. The Lord is old. His bones creek when he walks, his chairs never get a chance to breathe. No one around him seems to care much for him. They let him rot, they let him watch his beautiful world, the one he worked so hard to create, go to waste. His biggest mistake was putting people on it. His creation was so grand, his biggest success. Now it' s polluted, dirty. He' s ashamed of it. God does not consider him to be in power anymore. He handles nothing by himself.",

Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant. nnShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order.

Not as relaxing as walking in his circle around the tower. He kicked at the groove in the stone a bit with his foot. There seemed to be a hint of anxiousness in his movements. \" Three more months, \" he repeated. Three more months and the Winter would transmute the colour of the sky from azure and purple to dull shades of white and yellow. Though, that' s when his sister would come. She never grew up. After millions of years, she never grew up. The Old Man shook his head, and opened his book. Three more months until his sister came for him. \" I do n' t have to follow the rules in your book Destiny, \" a voice said. The Old Man knew it was his sister.

It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason?

For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats. nnI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place.

She flicked the lights on, her back to the door. \" Hey \" Angela jumped and turned, chef' s knife still in her hand. She saw a silhouette framed in the doorway. \" Wow is it dark out \" Hank said, walking in a putting down his hat. \" It' s gon na rain any minute so I cancelled practice for the kids. James and me were hoping you had n' t started dinner yet and we were thinking we' d take you out \". Catching her breath Angela replied \" Why, honey, that sounds wonderful.",

A loud ringing noise filled his ears. ‘ Yeah, yeah, I' m okay, fine, nothing to worry about. It' s just a piece of old— ‘ He fell silent, as he saw something amidst the mist of dust.

He moved towards the throne room where the man who stole his crown sat. He needed only to slay this king and claim the city for his own. His heart was racing as he took each step. The closure he came the heavier he felt. The sound of drums echoed in his ears. Rum bum bum rum bum bum. His sword swayed at his side. Then he looked upon the large blue doors. He stood in front of them for several seconds, just taking it in. For it had been a long time since his eyes saw these doors. He slowly pushed the doors open and stared right at the throne, and into the eyes of the man who sat upon it. \" I knew you would find your way here eventually, my son. \" \" You were right. I brought an army! \" \" An army that does not belong to you. \" \" They obey me, they take orders from me! \" \" It is safe to say you give orders better than you take them then. \" \" You took my crown from me! \" \" You were not ready to be king! \" The wind slowly blew through the doors causing Peldar' s black cape to twirl. Peldar moved closer and closer to his father drawing his sword a little bit with each step until it was fully unsheathed. \" You realize that this only ends one way. \" His father nodded. Then Peldar thrust his sword into the king' s chest. Blood dripped slowly from the wound. Peldar looked his father in the eyes, and then removed the blade. His father fell to his knees and hugged his son. Peldar immediately pushed him to the ground. Where he laid motionless.",

Several came up in my search but I noticed that the BBQ King was on triple D and the best thing I ever ate. So BBQ King it was and the plan was to try the BBQ chicken. nnWhen we landed in Charlotte on a Sunday and they were closed. So, on the return we gave ourselves a little time to check out the BBQ King. It's an old school drive-in with an intercom ordering system. I thought it was kind of cool. What first struck me looking at the menu was the lack of BBQ items. I saw burgers, steak, fried chicken and similar drive in type items. But I didn't worry because I had a plan to try the BBQ chicken; and for good measure I choose the minced BBQ sandwich. nnWhen the food came, I was surprised the BBQ chicken was fried chicken covered in BBQ sauce. It then dawned on me that in the Carolinas BBQ is pork; like the minced sandwich I ordered. Unfortunately, in my search for good BBQ, the BBQ King was not going to be my fix. But I had to try the food. I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was vinegary and the meat was moist and tender with a nice crunch. I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good! They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked. I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich. nnWould I recommend BBQ King? It was unique enough that with full disclosure yes. Would I go back again? Only if I was going with someone who had never been before.",

There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server.

Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant. nnShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home. nnTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work.

If only they knew the truth. The truth was, I had captured the attention of Death itself. Late one night as I walked home, a dark figure emerged from the shadows. \"Don't be afraid,\" it said in a smooth voice. My heart stopped when I realized who it was - the Grim Reaper had taken a liking to me. Every time since, Death would secretly intervene to save me at the last moment. A falling brick stopped inches from my head. The breaks on my car kicked in just before an accident. I figured it was just dumb luck. But I started noticing Death watching me from the sidelines.One day, Death finally worked up the courage to approach me. \"We keep meeting like this. I was wondering if you'd like to get coffee sometime?\" I stared in disbelief. Death, asking me on a date? It explained the constant near-misses. When I agreed just to find out what it wanted, Death seemed overjoyed. We met at a small cafe, an unusual pair. But Death was charming and interesting to talk to. Against all logic, I found myself enjoying our conversation.Our coffee date was cut short though, when a delivery truck lost its brakes heading toward the cafe. At the last second, Death waved its hand and the truck swerved away, crashing into a lamp post. \"Sorry, duty calls. Can I see you again?\" it asked shyly. And so began my bizarre relationship with Death. I looked forward to our meetings, learning about its fascinating world. But the near-death experiences didn't stop.

It was a small, digital display, showing the number 3,000,000.I was confused and a bit concerned. What could this number mean? I tried to brush it off and go about my morning routine, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.As I got dressed and prepared for the day, I noticed that other people were also sporting similar displays on their chests. Some had numbers in the single digits, while others had numbers in the thousands or even millions.I decided to try and ignore it and go about my day as usual. I headed to the kitchen to make some breakfast, but my thoughts kept returning to the mysterious number on my chest.As I ate my cereal, I couldn't help but notice the anxious looks on the faces of my family members. They too had numbers displayed on their chests, and they seemed just as confused and concerned as I was.I decided to try and find out more about this strange phenomenon. I grabbed my phone and did a quick search online, but there was no information about it. I tried calling my friends, but they were just as clueless as I was.Feeling frustrated and scared, I decided to head out and see if I could find any answers. I walked down the street, trying to make sense of the numbers on people's chests.As I walked, I noticed that some people were acting strangely. They were whispering to each other and casting nervous glances at those with higher numbers.I approached a group of people who were huddled together, discussing their numbers in hushed tones. They looked up at me as I approached, and their eyes widened in surprise. \"Your number is 3,000,000,\" one of them said, their voice full of awe and fear. \"That's the highest number we've seen.",

I'm creative, innovative, and passionate. I'm the perfect embodiment of the divine. \"Sarah couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. She had always thought of religion as something stuffy and oppressive, but now she was starting to see it in a whole new light. \"I never would have expected this,\" she said, shaking her head in wonder.Kanye smiled again.",

He tried to remember what had happened, but everything was a blur. The last thing he remembered was being at a party, laughing and talking with his friends. How had he ended up here? The jailer opened the door and entered the cell. \"Time for dinner,\" he said. He handed the prisoner a tray of food, then turned and left. The prisoner looked at the food, his stomach growling. He picked up the fork and took a bite. The food was cold and tasteless, but he ate it anyway. He knew that he needed to stay strong if he was ever going to get out of here. The prisoner finished his food and lay down on the bed. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but his mind was too active. He kept thinking about his friends, his family, and his life before prison. He wondered if he would ever see them again. The prisoner tossed and turned all night, but he couldn't sleep. Finally, he gave up and got out of bed. He walked over to the window and looked out. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. It was a beautiful day outside, but the prisoner couldn't enjoy it. He was trapped in a prison, and he didn't know how to escape. The prisoner spent the next few days exploring his new home. He found a small library, a gym, and a courtyard. He met some of the other prisoners, but he didn't make any friends.",

I'm not afraid of you. \"The figure took a step closer, its eyes narrowing. \"Oh, you should be. I can make your worst nightmares come true. \"I laughed. \"You can try, but I doubt it. I've already faced my worst fears, and I'm still standing. So, go ahead. Do your worst. \"The figure snarled and raised its hand, and suddenly I was engulfed in a searing pain. But I didn't scream, didn't flinch. I just stood there, my eyes fixed on the figure. \"Is that all you've got?\"",

No one spoke, no one offered any words of condolence. They simply left, disappearing into the darkness, their thoughts consumed by their own selfish interests.Outside, a lone figure stood watched the funeral from afar. It was a young woman, a former employee of the deceased. She had been fired after refusing to go along with his unethical business practices. She had come to the funeral to make sure that he was truly gone, to see for herself that he would never again be able to harm anyone else.As she turned to leave, she noticed a strange, old man standing nearby. He was dressed in black, and his eyes seemed to bore into her soul. He spoke in a low, gravelly voice, \"You should have come to the funeral, my dear. It would have been the perfect opportunity for you to pay your respects. \"The young woman felt a shiver run down her spine. Who was this strange old man, and how had he known that she had been an enemy of the deceased?",

With a herculean effort, he forced himself to turn and flee blindly into the trees. Branches clawed at his face and clothes as he crashed through the undergrowth.

The moment we stepped onto the rink, we knew we were in for a treat. The ice was perfectly smooth, and the atmosphere was electric.We started off by taking a few laps around the rink, getting a feel for the ice and the rhythm of our strides. It was exhilarating to be able to move so freely, the blades of our skates slicing effortlessly through the ice.As we gained confidence, we started to try out some tricks and jumps. The feeling of weightlessness as we took to the air was incredible, and we couldn't help but let out a few whoops of excitement.But it wasn't all smooth sailing. We took a few tumbles, too, especially when we tried to attempt some of the more advanced moves. But we didn't let that deter us. We laughed off our mistakes and kept on going, determined to master the techniques.After a few hours of skating, we decided to take a break and warm up with some hot chocolate from the rinkside cafe. It was the perfect way to refuel and recharge, and we enjoyed every sip as we watched the other skaters glide by.Refreshed and ready to go, we headed back out onto the ice. This time, we tried our hand at ice hockey. It was intense and physically demanding, but also incredibly fun. We played a friendly game with some of the other skaters, laughing and joking as we chased after the puck.As the evening drew to a close, we reluctantly made our way off the rink and back to our hotel. Our bodies were tired, but our spirits were high. We couldn't wait to come back and do it all again the next day.In conclusion, our visit to the ice rink was an unforgettable experience.",

As a child, she would sneak into the cemetery and lay among the tombstones, imagining what it would be like to pass over to the other side. One night, during a particularly bad storm, Emma was walking alone when she witnessed a terrible car accident. As she rushed to the mangled wreck to help, a figure emerged from the shadows - a pale man in a black cloak. \"Do not be afraid,\" he said in a soothing voice. She found herself inexplicably calm in his presence. That's when she knew - this must be Death himself. From that moment on, Emma became obsessed with seeing him again. She began volunteering at hospice care, hoping his next visit would be to one of the patients. Weeks went by without any sign of the mysterious stranger. Growing desperate, Emma hatched a plan. She started stalking elderly people in the city, waiting for the right opportunity. One night, an old man stumbled on the sidewalk - it was too easy. By the time police found his body, Emma had accomplished her goal. As she expected, Death appeared before her once more. \"You do not understand the consequences of your actions,\" he warned, though his tone held no accusation. Emma didn't care about consequences, only seeing him.The murders continued, each more brutal than the last. Still, Death only showed disapproval, not anger. His calm demeanor pulled her deeper under his spell. The headlines screamed \"Angel of Death on the Loose\" but Emma was past caring.One night, as she stood over her latest victim, Death did not come. Panicked, she rushed home and gathered all of her supplies for one final kill. But as she prepared to end an innocent life, a realization suddenly hit her - this was madness. She couldn't go on this way, committing evil for someone who would never love her back.",

I had to get to the bottom of this.As soon as I was outside, I pulled out my phone and dialed a number. It was a risky move, but I had no choice. I needed to know what was going on.The phone rang a few times before a familiar voice picked up. \"Hello? \"\"It's me,\" I said, trying to keep my voice low. \"I need to talk to you. Meet me at the usual place. \"There was a pause on the other end before the person agreed. I hung up the phone and made my way to the designated location.I arrived first and took a seat at the table, trying to calm my nerves. I had no idea what to expect, but I knew I had to be ready for anything.A few minutes later, the person arrived. It was a woman, a former colleague of mine. She sat down across from me and began to explain. \"Jack wasn't who you thought he was,\" she said. \"He was an undercover agent, working to take down a criminal organization. You were just a pawn in their game. \"My mind was reeling. I had been played. But I had faked my own death. How could they have known? \"They found out about your plan,\" the woman explained. \"They knew you were going to fake your own death, so they set up a trap. Jack was part of that trap. \"I couldn't believe it.",

I had mixed two seemingly ordinary substances together and watched in awe as they reacted to form a new, vibrant color that I had never seen before.At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, but as I continued to experiment with the compounds, I realized that the color was indeed real. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before - a deep, rich hue that seemed to shimmer and glow in the light.I was so excited by my discovery that I couldn't wait to share it with the world. I quickly grabbed my camera and took a photo of the color, eager to show it to my colleagues and friends.But when I showed them the photo, they just looked at me confused. \"What's that supposed to be?\" they asked. \"I don't see anything special about it. \"I was taken aback. Had I imagined the whole thing? I double-checked my equipment, thinking maybe there was something wrong with my camera or the lighting in the lab.But when I looked at the photo again, the color was still there, shining brightly. I realized that I must be seeing something that nobody else could.I started to experiment more, trying to find out what made this color unique. I discovered that it was only visible under certain lighting conditions, and that it seemed to shift and change depending on the angle of the light.I became obsessed with the color, spending all my free time in the lab trying to understand it. My colleagues started to notice my absence and asked if I was okay.I showed them the color, hoping they would see it too, but they just shook their heads. \"It's like you're seeing something we can't,\" they said.I started to wonder if I was going crazy. Was this color just a product of my imagination?",

He woke up every morning, went to his mundane job, and returned home to his empty apartment. But one day, something peculiar happened. As Ethan sat at his desk, typing away on his computer, he felt an odd sensation, as if he was being watched. It was a strange and unsettling feeling that he couldn't shake off.Curiosity drove Ethan to investigate further. He scoured his apartment, checking every nook and cranny for hidden cameras or listening devices. Much to his surprise, he found none. Perplexed, he pondered over this eerie feeling that persisted.Days turned into weeks, and Ethan's paranoia grew. He started noticing peculiar coincidences in his life, events that seemed too contrived to be mere chance. It was as if his life was flowing like a carefully crafted narrative, with him as the protagonist.Eventually, consumed by his curiosity, Ethan began to question his reality. He surmised that perhaps his life was not his own, but rather the creation of someone else. The notion seemed absurd at first, but as he delved deeper into his suspicions, the evidence became undeniable.He noticed inconsistencies in his memories, gaps in his own understanding of his past. It was as if someone had written his history and manipulated his perception of reality. Ethan couldn't ignore the truth any longer: he was a character, and he had a creator.Filled with a mixture of anger and curiosity, Ethan decided to confront his creator. He sat down at his computer, the very tool through which his existence emanated. With trembling fingers, he typed a message to the one who held the reins of his life. \"Who are you?\" Ethan typed, his heart pounding with anticipation.Moments passed, and then the words appeared on the screen. \"I am the author of your story,\" was the response.\"Why?\"",

He plans to go back in time to 1945 and convince Hitler to surrender, thereby avoiding the need for a gruesome assassination. I must come up with a new plan to outdo him and defend my title.I decide to go back in time to 1944 and intercept Hitler's train as it travels through Germany. I board the train and plant a bomb in the engine car. As the train approaches a tunnel, I detonate the bomb, derailing the train and killing Hitler instantly.My opponent tries to top my score by going back in time to 1943 and infiltrating Hitler's personal security team. He successfully gains Hitler's trust and is appointed as his personal bodyguard. He then poisons Hitler's food, but Hitler survives and is left with a severe illness.In response, I decide to go back in time to 1941 and prevent Hitler from ever rising to power. I infiltrate the German Workers' Party and convince key members to reject Hitler's leadership. Without Hitler's influence, Germany's aggression towards other countries is greatly reduced, and World War II is averted.My opponent attempts to counter my move by going back in time to 1938 and preventing the Munich Agreement, which allowed Germany to annex Austria. He successfully convinces British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to stand up to Hitler's demands, and Germany's expansion is halted.I then go back in time to 1936 and infiltrate the Summer Olympics in Berlin, where Hitler is in attendance.",

Elated, I decided to use this power to help others.9. My tweet the next day said \"Tell your friend Jake about the internship at your company.\". 10. The day after, Jake thanked me profusely for the job opportunity.11. Though it felt good helping people, changing the past worried me. 12. That night I messaged \"Be careful how you use this power, the future isn't set.\"13. A week went by with no further contact from my past selves.14. Then came a desperate tweet \"Break up with Amanda before she breaks your heart.\"15. Confused, I asked my past self what had happened with Amanda.16. Receiving no reply, I began to doubt the whole experience. 17. The next day brought a grim message: \"It's too late, I'm sorry.\" 18. Panicked, I rushed to try and undo the damage. 19. But without details there was nothing I could do to fix it. 20. Several days later I awoke to a novel's worth of tweets.21. My past selves had chronicled the full story of what happened with Amanda. 22. Though painful, it helped me understand and come to terms with it.23. After that, messages focused on self-improvement and wisdom.24. Over time, with guidance from my past selves, I became happier and healthier. 25. Though the power came with challenges, on balance it enriched my life greatly.26.",

Some people found solace in those words, knowing that their soulmate's love would be forever engraved on their skin. But for others, like me, it was a constant reminder of the unknown. Every time I caught a glimpse of those words, doubt and fear would claw at my heart. \"I never loved you\" was etched on my skin, mocking my existence.As the years went by, I searched for love, hoping to prove those words wrong. I longed for someone to come into my life and change the meaning behind those painful last words. But every relationship ended in heartbreak, as if fate was determined to fulfill its prophecy. The finality of those words weighed heavily on my soul, pushing me into isolation.One day, as I sat in a park, contemplating the meaninglessness of it all, a stranger sat down next to me. Her eyes sparkled with kindness, and her smile held a glimmer of understanding. We started talking, sharing stories and dreams, and in that moment, a flicker of hope ignited within me. Could she be the one to prove my destiny wrong?Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months as our connection grew stronger. We navigated life's challenges together, supporting one another through thick and thin. She became my confidante, my rock, and with each passing day, I felt my heart opening up to the possibility of love.Then, one fateful night, during a quiet moment in our shared sanctuary, I mustered the courage to reveal the truth etched on my skin. As she traced the words with her fingertips, her eyes brimmed with tears, and she pulled me into a tender embrace. \"Don't you see?\" she whispered. \"Those words are a lie. My heart has always belonged to you.",

I approached the reception desk, and a young woman looked up at me with a mixture of confusion and annoyance. \"can I help you?\" She asked, clearly not impressed by my presence. \"I'm here to see Perry white,\" I replied, trying to sound as confident as possible.

It had been weeks since the nuclear blast had decimated the world above, and I had lost all sense of what awaited me on the surface. Slowly, cautiously, I stepped out into a wasteland of destruction.

Dust hung in the air, casting an eerie haze over the desolate landscape. As I surveyed the scene before me, I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and desolation. The city that was once teeming with life and bustling with activity now stood as a haunting reminder of what had been. Tears welled up in my eyes as I realized the magnitude of the devastation. My footsteps echoed in the silence as I cautiously made my way through the wreckage. There were no signs of life, no trace of the familiar faces that once filled these streets. The only sound that could be heard was the distant, haunting cry of a lone bird. Nature, too, seemed to have been a casualty of the catastrophe. Trees stood charred and leafless, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers towards the sky. The ground beneath my feet was littered with debris and remnants of a world that existed no more. Broken toys, shattered glass, and torn fragments of photographs served as painful reminders of the lives that had been irrevocably changed. A gust of wind blew through the ruins, sending a chill down my spine and causing me to shiver.

It has old school charm and is smaller than most casinos. The casino is laid out so that you can see everything from one end to the other. Ding! Ding! Ding! Hit a jackpot on my first pull! The loosest slots in Vegas according to a local. If you don't win here you won't win anywhere. For an older casino it has been updated nicely. The rooms are nice and clean with new furniture, flat screen TV's and granite counter tops. The beds were really comfortable and had great pillows. The bathroom was small but didn't feel cramped. The shower was bigger than most hotel showers. The casino is in a great location right downtown on Fremont Street. It is close to everything. If you can book a room facing Fremont Street. I loved watching the light show and people watching. One night the Fremont Street Experience was having a party with music and dancing. It was so much fun sitting on the balcony watching everyone having fun below. We ate at the buffet for breakfast one morning. It was a typical Vegas buffet. The food was just average. I would recommend trying one of the many restaurants nearby. The Golden Gate has a great little coffee shop that is reasonably priced. It has a 50's theme. We had lunch there once and it was good. The servers and staff were very friendly and helpful. They made us feel right at home. It is nice to stay in a hotel that isn't huge and impersonal. It was great hearing all the history of this hotel. The bellman told us that the hotel was built by a man that made his millions during the gold rush in California. He spared no expense on this hotel. The safe in our room was the original safe from when the hotel was built.",

I tried to stand up, but my feet kept slipping on the soft lump that was Morty's body. I finally managed to climb out of the coffin, my hands shaking as I tried to steady myself. I looked down at Morty's body, feeling a twinge of guilt for sleeping on him. But I couldn't help it, I was exhausted.I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself. I knew I had to face the crowd, to explain what had happened. But before I could say anything, my mother spoke up. \"What are you doing here?\" she demanded, her voice cold and angry. \"You're supposed to be dead,\" she spat.I hesitated, unsure of what to say. I looked at my father, but he was avoiding my eyes. I looked at my sister, but she was staring at the ground. I realized that I was on my own. \"I don't know,\" I said finally. \"I just woke up. I didn't mean to sleep on Uncle Morty. \"My mother's face twisted in anger. \"You didn't mean to?\" she repeated. \"You didn't mean to sleep on a dead body? What is wrong with you? \"I felt a lump form in my throat. I knew I had messed up, big time. But I couldn't help it. I was tired, and I had made a mistake. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.",

My puppy, Max, was standing on my chest, his tiny body trembling with fear.The creatures didn't seem to notice Max at first, but as they reached out to grab me, he suddenly let out a deep, rumbling growl. It was a sound that didn't belong to a dog his size, and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.One of the creatures, a tall, muscular figure with piercing blue eyes, looked down at Max in surprise. \"Uriel, call for backup,\" he said to the other creature, a shorter, more slender being with wings that seemed to shimmer in the dark. \"It's a hellhound. \"I didn't have time to process what was happening. The creature called Uriel quickly reached for a small device on his belt and pressed a few buttons.

Who were these creatures, and what did they want with me? I tried to speak, but my voice was shaking. \"W-what do you want? \"The creature called Uriel stepped forward, his eyes fixed on Max. \"We have come for the hellhound,\" he said. \"It is a creature of great power, and it must be contained.",

It was a huge portion of pulled pork with all the fixings, and delicious! Service was quick and efficient, despite it being pretty busy for a Saturday morning. My only complaint was that the coffee was a little weak for my tastes.It's a small cafe so be ready to wait a little bit for a table. Service was quick and very friendly.

The waves were higher, the winds stronger, and the sky was filled with a sense of foreboding.As he watched, a small boat appeared on the horizon, struggling to make its way through the turbulent waters. The old man's heart went out to the sailors on board, knowing that they were in grave danger.Despite his fear, the old man did not turn away. He stood firm, his eyes fixed on the boat, his mind working overtime to come up with a plan to save the sailors.As the boat drew closer, the old man could see that it was taking on water, its hull cracked and battered. He knew that time was running out, and he had to act fast.Without hesitation, the old man took off his cloak and waded into the sea, the icy water biting at his skin. He swam out to the boat, his strokes strong and purposeful.As he reached the boat, he could see the fear in the eyes of the sailors. They were tired, hungry, and scared. But the old man's calm demeanor seemed to ease their fears, and they listened intently as he explained his plan.Together, they worked to patch up the boat, using the old man's cloak to plug the holes and repair the damage. It was a slow and painstaking process, but they knew they had no choice.As they worked, the storm raged on, its fury unrelenting. But the old man and the sailors persevered, their determination and resilience in the face of danger a testament to their strength.Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the boat was ready to set sail once again. The old man watched as the sailors climbed aboard, their faces set with determination.As they sailed away, the old man felt a sense of pride and relief wash over him.",

The band that plays here is amazing, and they always get the crowd dancing and singing along. The music is a mix of classic rock and Irish tunes, which is perfect for the occasion. The crowd is always friendly and welcoming, and it's easy to strike up a conversation with someone new.One of the things I love about this place is the decor. It's got a classic, timeless feel to it, with dark wood walls and furniture, and plenty of green and gold accents to give it that Irish flair. The lighting is dim and cozy, which adds to the warm and inviting atmosphere. And of course, there's plenty of Guinness and other Irish beers on tap, which is a must for any St. Patrick's Day celebration.The staff here is always friendly and attentive, and they do a great job of keeping the pub running smoothly. They're quick to refill your drink and make sure you've got everything you need. And if you're feeling hungry, they've got a great menu of classic Irish pub fare, like shepherd's pie, fish and chips, and corned beef and cabbage.One of the things that sets this place apart from other pubs is their commitment to live music. They've got a great sound system, and the stage is always set up with a variety of instruments and equipment. The band plays for hours, and they always get the crowd involved, whether it's through singing, dancing, or even joining in on a few instruments. It's a truly interactive experience, and it's something that you won't find at many other places.Overall, this place is a must-visit for anyone looking to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in style. The atmosphere is lively and fun, the music is great, and the staff is friendly and attentive.",

The pasta dishes are made with homemade noodles and the sauces are flavorful. The salads are fresh and crisp. The prices are very reasonable. A large pizza is only $15.00 and a pasta dish is around $10.00. They also have a lunch buffet for $7.95. The service is always good. The staff is friendly and attentive.

She started to realize that her drawings were not as good as she thought they were. In fact, they were downright terrible. Despite this, Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that her drawings had a life of their own. She would often catch glimpses of them moving out of the corner of her eye, but whenever she turned to look, they would be still and lifeless. One day, Sarah decided to test her theory. She spent hours working on a particularly terrible drawing of a horse. It was lopsided, with uneven legs and a misshapen body. But as soon as she finished, the horse began to stir. It shook its head and looked around, seemingly confused. Sarah was both thrilled and terrified. She had never seen anything like it before. But as the horse began to move, Sarah realized that it was not as magical as she had imagined. It was clumsy and awkward, stumbling over its own feet. It looked at Sarah with a dim, confused expression, as if it didn't know what it was or why it was alive. Sarah felt a pang of guilt. She had brought this creature into the world, but she had no idea how to take care of it. She tried to feed it, but it wouldn't eat. It just stood there, looking at her with those big, dumb eyes. Sarah knew she had to do something. She couldn't just leave the horse standing there, alive but pointless. So she took it outside, to the field behind her house. She set it free, hoping it would find its way in the world. But as she watched it stumble away, Sarah couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. Her drawings were not the magical creations she had dreamed of.",

My mind raced with questions: who was this guard? How could I trust him? And most importantly, how were we going to pull off an escape?Despite my doubts, I couldn't shake the feeling of hope that had been reignited within me. I had to take a chance, had to believe that this guard was my only chance at freedom.So, I waited, my heart pounding in my chest, as the days ticked by at a glacial pace. I barely slept, my mind consumed by thoughts of the escape.Finally, the day arrived. The guard, a tall, imposing figure with a gruff demeanor, appeared outside my cell. \"It's time,\" he said, his voice low and urgent.I followed him, my heart racing, as he led me through a maze of corridors and stairwells. We passed other guards, who eyed us suspiciously, but my guard seemed to know exactly what he was doing.We reached a small door that I had never noticed before. The guard produced a key, and with a quick twist, the door swung open. We were outside, the cool night air a welcome relief after the stifling heat of the prison.We moved quickly, our footsteps echoing through the deserted streets. I couldn't believe it: we were really doing it.",

The pain of losing him is indescribable.I remember the day he was born, how excited I was to have a little brother. I pushed his stroller, played with him, and taught him everything I knew. He looked up to me, and I tried my best to be a good role model.Years went by, and we grew apart. He made choices that I didn't agree with, and we argued often. But even when we didn't see eye to eye, I still loved him. He was my brother, and that's something that never changed.The day he passed away, everything changed. I was in shock, and I didn't know how to process my emotions. All I could think about was the memories we had shared, and how much I wished things could have been different.The funeral was a blur, but I remember every detail. The sound of the rain on the umbrellas, the smell of the fresh-cut flowers, and the sight of his coffin. It was a moment that I never wanted to experience, but it's one that I'll always carry with me.As I stood there, watching them lower his body into the ground, I couldn't help but feel a sense of regret. Regret for the arguments we had, regret for not being there for him when he needed me, and regret for not being able to say goodbye.But even in death, my brother taught me a valuable lesson. He taught me that family is everything, and that we should never take them for granted. He taught me that even when we disagree, love is still possible.Yesterday, I buried my brother. It was a day that I'll never forget, but it's also a day that changed me forever. I'll always cherish the memories we shared, and I'll never forget the lesson he taught me.",

Jane had just gotten back from her business trip and we were celebrating at one of our favorite spots. I wanted everything to be perfect so I made reservations weeks ago. But of course, life had other plans and I totally spaced on the actual date. When we pulled up, I started panicking that they wouldn't have a table. But the hostess was perfectly accommodating, joking that I must really like this place to let it slip my mind for so long. She seated us at a classy looking table by the window, and it was like the stars aligned just for us. We ordered drinks as we caught up on our weeks apart, laughing about all the crazy work stories. It felt so good to be together again. The bartender brought over a complimentary appetizer on the house for our troubles, knowing smiles all around. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, the most spectacular sun was setting over the park, bathing us in a warm glow.Our entrees arrived steaming hot and packed with flavor. Jane raved about her seared scallops, claiming they were the best she'd ever had. I went for the filet, perfectly medium rare like I requested. The meat just melted in my mouth. We debated ordering dessert but our plates were licked clean. As if on cue, our server reappeared asking about dessert. I told her we were still recovering from our mains but she insisted we at least take a look at the selections. Two bites of the chocolate mousse cake later and we were sold, gleefully splitting it between us. Full and content, we lingered over our last drinks enjoying the perfect night. When the bill came I was shocked at the total, they had taken such good care of us.",

I was still young, with my whole life ahead of me.But there was no denying the truth. The body in the bag was mine, and I was gone.I thought about all the things I would never get to do now. I would never fall in love, never have children, never grow old.Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, but I fought them back.

The food was okay, nothing really wow-ed me but nothing was outright bad either, it was all pretty average really. The service was fine, a little slow at times but the staff were friendly enough. The main issue for me was the space, it was way too small and cramped inside. We could barely move between the tables and felt like we were on top of the other diners the whole time. On a busy night it must feel claustrophobic in there. I also didn't love how loud it got with all the hard surfaces, you really had to raise your voice to be heard.If they'd put even a few plants or photos on the walls it might have felt less stark and industrial but it really lacked character or charm. The music was good but very loud too. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the Instagram shots from the beautiful dishes look great but in reality the ambiance really fell flat for me. It was trying too hard to be a cool hipster spot rather than having its own identity. And honestly, who cares about being trendy if you don't enjoy actually hanging out there?In the end, while the food and service were satisfactory, I didn't really feel like I needed to return. It had the novelty factor the first time around but I can easily pass on it in future. With so many other great options in the area, this place didn't give me a real \"Wow I must come back!\" feeling. Those babies deserve my repeat business more than this place does right now.Maybe they just need to find their feet still but for me, it didn't feel worth battling the crowds for an average experience.",

It was a pungent mix of stale cigarettes, old grease, and what could only be described as \"essence of dumpster.\" It was so overpowering that it made my eyes water.But the real kicker was the service. Or should I say, the lack thereof. The staff seemed completely disinterested in our presence, barely acknowledging us even when we tried to order. It took forever to get our food, and when it arrived, it was clear that they'd just warmed up some old leftovers and slapped them onto a plate.I ordered a burger, which was supposed to come with fries. But the fries were cold and soggy, and the burger was overcooked and dry. It was clear that they'd been sitting out for a while, as the bun was stale and the lettuce was wilted.My friend's salad was no better. The lettuce was brown around the edges, and the dressing was so bland that it might as well have been water. She couldn't even finish it.We tried to order dessert, but the server informed us that they were out of everything except for a single chocolate cake that had clearly been sitting out for days. We passed.As we were leaving, we noticed that the front door was stuck open, allowing a steady stream of flies to enter the restaurant. It was like they were welcome guests.Overall, this place was a complete disaster. I've never had a worse dining experience, and I've eaten at some real dives in my time. The fact that it's still in business is a mystery to me. Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

The last few times we have went, the service has been great. The bartender, I think her name is Sarah, is always so friendly and quick with a refill. And the food, don't even get me started on how good it is! Those Buffalo wings are like nothing I've had before, absolutely covered in sauce but somehow they don't overwhelm your mouth. And those truffle fries, oh man are they delicious. I know truffle oil isn't everyone's thing but they do it so well, a little goes a long way to give the fries such rich flavor without being too strong. We would have to come inside to order things instead of waiting at our cars like the drive thrus around here. But it's nice to sit down and relax for a bit instead of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. The outdoor seating is also really nice in the summer, those string lights make such a cozy atmosphere at night. Although a few times they've sat us right by the kitchen door and you definitely notice the heat coming off the grill! Hopefully they'll fix that issue. I will say it does get kinda crowded in there during the dinner rush but the staff always hustles to turn the tables over quickly. Other than that, my only complaint is they could use a little more variety in the draft beers sometimes. But how can you really complain when the food and drinks are this good? Honestly I think some people just like to be stingy with their ratings. There was one guy a few weeks back absolutely losing it on the poor bartender because she was \"screwing\" him out of another whiskey shot. Sir it's 11pm on a Tuesday, maybe time to call it quits!",

I started to research ways to protect my privacy, but it seemed like everything I did was futile.One night, I received a mysterious message. It said, \"Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight.\" I was hesitant, but something inside of me urged me to go.When I arrived, I saw a figure in the shadows. It was a man in a black hoodie, and he handed me a USB drive. \"This contains the truth,\" he said. \"Spread it far and wide. \"I took the drive and ran home. I couldn't wait to see what was on it. When I plugged it in, I was shocked.There were files upon files of government secrets. Videos of cover-ups, documents of conspiracies. It was all there.I knew I had to share this with the world. I uploaded it all to a secure server and waited.Soon, the news was flooded with stories of government corruption. People were outraged, demanding change.It was a long time coming, but finally, the truth was out. Snowden was just a small part of a much larger cover-up.I felt a sense of relief, knowing that I had played a small part in exposing the truth.",

I asked the same service coordinator, and they apologized, saying they were swamped with other cars and short-staffed. Ugh. No time to dwell on that, though, because I had a meeting at work I couldn't miss.I decided to take the bus and leave my car with them, hoping it would be ready when I got back. Boy, am I glad I did!

I demanded an explanation, and they just shrugged and said they hadn't gotten to it yet. No shit, Sherlock!Long story short, after some heated words and a lot of waiting around, they finally managed to change my oil. By that point, I was beyond annoyed. I mean, it's not rocket science, right? Just drain the old oil, replace the filter, and pour in the new stuff. How hard can it be?I left the place feeling utterly disappointed.",

I flung it open, ready to face whatever was on the other side.What I saw took my breath away. A dark figure loomed in front of me, its eyes glowing red in the dim light. I raised my bat, ready to fight for my life. But then, something strange happened.The figure spoke. It told me that it was not here to harm me, but to guide me. It said that my time on this earth was coming to an end, but that I had a choice. I could go peacefully, or I could fight and prolong the inevitable.I was taken aback by its words.

The wind howled as the rain battered his windowpane. \"What nonsense is this? \", he grumbled holding up the sodden paper to his lamp. But something about the message stirred something deep within him. He paced his study, running his hands through his thinning hair. Nothing else was written, just those seven strange words. \"It was inside you all along\". But what did it mean? And how did the thing even get here? A flash of lightning lit his chambers, revealing shadows in the corners that hadn't been there before. Or had they? Sir's heart began to race. He poured himself a finger of whiskey with a shaking hand. As he tossed it back, another flash came and for a moment he thought he saw a face peering back at him from the paper.The whisky wasn't helping to settle his nerves none. With a sigh he sat back in his chair, rubbing his temple with fingers, trying to ignore the scratching sounds now coming from the walls. That's when he noticed the book on his shelf was askew. Strange, he didn't recall touching it. Pulling it out, dust flew everywhere, causing him to cough. The book fell open as if by an invisible hand and a passage was highlighted. To his shock, it contained the same mysterious message. His blood ran cold as a realization started forming in his troubled mind.All those years of research, of studying ancient magics and hidden knowledge, could it be that all along he had found what he was searching for? But had not recognized it? It was there, buried deep in his own subconscious all this time. The answer was inside himself, as the paper, the book, were trying to reveal.But unlocking what lingered in the dark corners of his own psyche, that was surely too dangerous.",

I've had a few breakups recently, and he's helped me change up my look to match my new single life.

Caleb roused me with panic, \"They've found us!\" Grabbing hastily packed gear, we fled into the mist-filled woods. Behind, crashing branches signaled our pursuers gave chase with fervor. Through thick brambles we crashed, thorns tearing at skin and cloth. Still the howls neared with every labored breath. A snapping of jaws echoed too close for comfort. With a yell, Caleb stumbled and fell upon hidden roots. As I dragged him up, glinting fangs appeared through the fog.In a blinding flurry, claws rent flesh where moments before we stood. A pained yelp told of one beast dispatched, but more surrounded, starving for the kill. Gripping Caleb's arm, I shouted \"This way, quickly!\" Dodging snapping jaws, we broke from the treeline at a cliff's edge. With a cry, I shoved Caleb ahead of me, then turned to face our pursuers one last time. Three hulking forms emerged, hacking and snarling.",

For I held a secret that could shatter their belief—I wasn't the chosen one they sought.The real chosen one, a figure of legend, had met an untimely fate, and in a moment of desperation, I had seized their identity. It was a selfish act, driven by a mix of fear and a yearning for purpose. But as I gazed into the stranger's hopeful eyes, a pang of remorse tugged at my conscience. \"I apologize,\" I stammered, my voice trembling. \"There's been a terrible mistake. I'm not who you think I am. \"Yet, instead of anger or disappointment, a glimmer of understanding flickered in the stranger's eyes. \"It matters not who you were,\" they replied softly. \"What matters is the potential within you. The true chosen one was destined for greatness, and I believe that greatness lies within you too. \"With a mix of trepidation and curiosity, I found myself accepting their offer to train me in the ancient arts and mystical powers that the chosen one possessed. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as I immersed myself in a world I never knew existed.My guilt gnawed at me, threatening to unravel the intricate web of lies I had woven. Each lesson, each revelation of my newfound abilities, only deepened my internal conflict. How could I wield powers meant for another? How could I deceive those who believed in me?As the final day of training approached, I knew I couldn't bear the weight of my deception any longer. In the depths of night, I sought out the stranger who had brought me into this extraordinary journey. \"I can't continue,\" I confessed, tears stinging my eyes. \"I'm not the chosen one.",

The crust was so cardboard-like and tasteless that I questioned whether it was actually made from dough. It was like eating a piece of stale bread with some tomato sauce slapped on top. And speaking of the sauce, it was overly sweet and lacked any real depth of flavor. It tasted like they poured a can of tomato paste right out of the can and called it a day. But that's not even the worst part. The cheese, if you can even call it that, was an abomination. It was rubbery and fake, like a plastic imitation of mozzarella. It didn't melt properly and had this weird, artificial aftertaste that lingered in my mouth long after I took a bite. I've had better cheese on those cheap frozen pizzas you find at the grocery store. And let's not forget about the toppings. Well, actually, let's forget about them because there were barely any. I had to squint my eyes and use a microscope to find traces of the sad, shriveled pepperoni and minuscule bits of vegetables. It was like they were rationing the toppings or trying to save money by skimping on everything. The overall presentation was equally disappointing. The pizza arrived looking sad and droopy, like it had been tossed around in the delivery car for a good hour before it made its way to my door. It was so unappetizing that I had to force myself to take a bite, hoping that maybe the taste would somehow make up for its sorry appearance. Spoiler alert: it didn't. I've had pizzas from hole-in-the-wall joints before, and while they may not look like a work of art, they always deliver in taste. This place, however, managed to fail on both counts. It's like they completely forgot what a good pizza should be like. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy, let alone a pizza lover.",

The place was so outdated that it made me question if I had stepped into a time warp. The furniture looked like it came straight out of a 1970s sitcom, you know, the ones with shag carpets and mustard-colored recliners. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to keep that retro vibe going, but it definitely wasn't a good idea.The service was equally as disappointing. I don't think I've ever encountered a more apathetic and slow staff in my life. It was like they were on a mission to set a new world record for the longest wait time. Seriously, I could have gone out, picked up a pizza, come back, and they still wouldn't have taken my order. Now, let me tell you about the food. Oh boy, where do I even begin? It was an absolute disaster! I ordered their signature dish, and when it arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes. The presentation was a joke, and the taste? Well, let's just say it matched the dingy decor perfectly. Mediocre doesn't even begin to describe it. I tried to give them a chance and ordered a dessert, thinking it couldn't get any worse. But nope, I was wrong again. The dessert was like a sad excuse for something sweet. It was as if they threw some random ingredients together, hoping for the best, but the result was a disappointment.In conclusion, this place is a definite no-go.",

The first power is Call, which allows me to summon things with a single thought. I tested it out immediately, and to my surprise, a cup of hot coffee materialized in front of me. It was like having a personal genie, but without all the complicated wishes and lamps. As I sipped my magically summoned coffee, I thought about the second power I had acquired: Seal. This power enables me to seal anything or anyone away in an impenetrable container. It's like having a supernatural Tupperware collection. I realized that with these powers, I had a tremendous amount of responsibility. I could do so much good for the world, or I could use them for selfish purposes. I decided to start small and test the limits of my abilities. Using the Call power, I summoned a stray kitten that had been wandering the streets. It looked scared and hungry, so I quickly used my Seal power to create a cozy little box for it to sleep in. Now, it had a safe and warm place to call home.

There were artists who needed inspiration, students who wanted to ace their exams, and even some who wanted me to summon their favorite snacks when they were feeling peckish.

Why not?\" she asks. \"Because I don't want to,\" I say. \"But you have to,\" she says. \"It's the rule. \"\"I don't care,\" I say. \"I'm not doing it. \"My mom is speechless. She can't believe that I'm disobeying her. She opens her mouth to say something, but then she closes it again. She knows that I'm serious.I turn and walk away. I feel a sense of victory. I've finally stood up to my mom, and I've won.I go downstairs and make myself some breakfast. I sit at the table and look out the window. I feel a sense of peace. I've finally broken free from the chains of the button.I know that my mom is going to be mad at me, but I don't care. I'm finally free.I finish my breakfast and get ready for school. I put on my shoes and head out the door. I take a deep breath of fresh air and smile. I'm finally free to be myself.I walk to school and I feel like I'm on top of the world.",

        "text": "As I look back on those fateful days, I can't help but shiver at the thought of how close I came to joining the ranks of the undead. It started with a few isolated incidents, rumors of strange illnesses and bizarre behavior. But before we knew it, the entire city was overrun with mindless, flesh-eating zombies.I was at work when the first wave hit. My boss, a man named Steve, was the first to go. He had always been a bit of a grump, but I never expected him to turn into a snarling, drooling monster. We locked the doors and barricaded ourselves in, but it was only a matter of time before they broke through.I grabbed a fire extinguisher and prepared to make my last stand. But then, something unexpected happened. The zombies suddenly stopped in their tracks, as if they had received some sort of signal. We cautiously emerged from our makeshift fortress and saw that they had all frozen in place, their blank faces twisted in a grotesque parody of confusion.We took advantage of the brief lull to make a break for it, sprinting through the empty streets and dodging the petrified zombies. We found a small group of survivors and banded together, fighting our way through the hordes and scavenging for food and supplies.We holed up in an abandoned grocery store, barricading the doors and windows as best we could. But even as we huddled together in fear, we couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope. We had survived the worst of it, and maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to reclaim our world from the undead.As the days passed, we began to hear rumors of a possible cure. A group of scientists had allegedly discovered a way to reverse the effects of the zombie virus, and were working to distribute it to the remaining survivors. We didn't know if it was true, but it was enough to keep us going.We continued to fight, to scavenge, and to hold on to hope.",

I was so excited about the prospect of working for this company that I had not taken the time to properly research the company culture. I tried to calm my nerves by telling myself that it was just a job and that I could always quit if it didn't work out. But the doubt and anxiety remained, and I began to doubt my own judgment. Now, as I waited for a reply, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just signed up for a nightmare. Was I really prepared for the challenges that lay ahead? I tried to push these thoughts away and focus on the present moment. Had I been too hasty in my decision? Would my new boss be a tyrant? But as the minutes passed, my anxiety grew. I began to imagine all sorts of terrible things. Would I be expected to work long hours with no life balance? Would my colleagues be unbearable to work with? I felt as if I were caught in a vortex of uncertainty, unable to escape the fears that were consuming me. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I received an email from the company. I opened it with a sinking heart, bracing myself for the worst. But to my surprise, the email was friendly and welcoming. The founder himself had written to me, expressing his pleasure at having me on board. I felt a wave of relief, and my doubts began to fade. He also mentioned that the company culture was relaxed and supportive, and that work-life balance was a priority. I decided to take a deep breath and embrace this new chapter with an open mind. Perhaps I had been too hasty in my judgment. Perhaps this job would turn out to be a great opportunity after all. Who knows? Maybe I wouldn't regret this decision after all.",

Words could inspire, words could heal, words could destroy. You never paid much attention to the phrase “choose your words carefully” until now. The fate of the world rests on your ability to choose the right words. You are standing before a group of world leaders, each representing a different country, and they are all looking at you expectantly. You take a deep breath and begin to speak. You have been given the task of convincing these leaders to come together and sign a peace treaty. It is no easy task, but you are determined to succeed. Each word you utter is carefully chosen, each sentence crafted with care. The room is silent except for the sound of your voice. You use persuasive language, you appeal to their emotions, you paint pictures with your words. You speak of the devastation of war, of the loss of life, of the impact on future generations. You remind them of their responsibilities as leaders and the power they hold in their hands. The leaders are captivated by your speech, and you can see the wheels turning in their minds. You can see their heads nodding in agreement, their faces softening, their arms uncrossing. As you continue to speak, you notice a change in the room. The tension is easing, the atmosphere is changing, and a sense of unity is beginning to take hold. You end your speech with a call to action. You urge them to put aside their differences, to find common ground, and to sign the peace treaty. You feel hope rising in your chest. It is clear that your words have had the desired effect. The room erupts in applause. The leaders gather around the table, shaking hands and exchanging words. You have done it. You have used the power of words to change the course of history.",

I started browsing through the different categories, laughing at some of the ridiculous situations that the fans had come up with. Suddenly I stumbled upon a story that made my heart stop. It was about me. At first I thought it was just a normal fanfic, but as I started reading I realized that it was something completely different. The story portrayed me as a villain, someone who wanted to destroy the world. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. I tried to dismiss it, telling myself that it was just a silly story, but I couldn’t help feeling uneasy. How could anyone think that I would do such a thing? I felt a cold sweat trickle down my spine as I read on. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it only seemed to get worse. The story portrayed me as a monster, someone who took pleasure in the suffering of others. I couldn’t just sit there and let people think that I was a monster. How could anyone think that I was capable of such horrors? I knew that I had to do something, but I didn’t know what. I decided to try to find the person who had written the story. I scrolled through the author’s profile, trying to find any information that might lead me to them. Maybe they would listen to reason and take the story down. But it was all in vain. There was no way to contact them, no way to make them understand. I felt a wave of hopelessness wash over me. I knew that I wasn’t a monster, but how could I prove it to the world? How could I ever escape this horrible portrayal of myself? I felt as if I were trapped in a nightmare from which I couldn’t wake up. I knew that I would never be able to look at myself the same way again.",

It was a warm summer afternoon, and I was feeling restless, as if I needed something to fill the void inside me. I took a deep breath and let the cool, smooth surface of the object sink into my hands. It felt strange, alien, like something from another world. But as soon as I pressed the button, everything changed. My senses were sharper, my mind was racing. I felt alive, as if I could do anything. The rush came instantaneously, like a wave crashing over me. At first, it was just a casual thing, something I did on the weekend or after work to relax. But I was hooked. I started to count the minutes until I could get home and do it again. My friends started to notice. They'd invite me out, but I'd say I had other plans. My family started to worry. But I didn't have any plans, just a constant craving for that rush. My mother would find me in my room, surrounded by the paraphernalia, the faint smell of chemicals in the air. She'd ask if I was okay, if I needed help. But I'd just shrug and say I was fine. I knew I wasn't fine. I tried to cut down, to limit myself, but it was no use. I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of craving and satisfaction. The withdrawal symptoms were brutal. I was irritable, anxious, depressed. I was addicted. I knew I needed help. I'd shake, sweat, feel as if I was crawling out of my own skin. But as soon as I gave in and did it again, all the symptoms disappeared. I went to a therapist, hoping to find a way out of this cycle. But even as I sat there, talking about my problems, I couldn't help thinking about the next time I could do it.",

I did some research and decided to take the plunge and buy one. I’ve been using my smartwatch for a few weeks now, and I have to say it’s been a great addition to my daily routine. It’s so convenient to have all the information I need right on my wrist. I can check the time, get notifications, and even track my fitness goals without having to carry my phone around. I can also track my sleep, which has been interesting to see how much rest I’m getting each night. One of my favorite features of my smartwatch is the ability to monitor my heart rate. I’ve been trying to get in shape lately, and it’s been really helpful to be able to track my progress. I also love that I can listen to music without having to carry my phone around while I’m working out. Another feature I’ve been using a lot is the music controls. I can easily control the music and volume right from my wrist, which is so much easier than having to pull out my phone every time I want to change a song. I’ve also been using the built-in timer to help me stay on schedule. One thing that has surprised me about my smartwatch is how long the battery lasts. It’s easy to set reminders and timers for different tasks and events, and it’s helpful to have them right on my wrist where I can see them. I thought it would need to be charged every day, but it can actually go for a few days on a single charge. That’s really convenient, especially when I’m traveling and don’t want to have to worry about finding a charger. All in all, I’m really happy with my smartwatch.",

You look around, trying to figure out where you are. You are in a small, plain room with white walls and a single window. You don’t remember how you got here or why you’re here. You feel panic rising in you as you realize you have no idea where you are or how you got here. You try to remember, but your memories are hazy and fragmented. You can’t even remember your name. You look around the room again, hoping to find something that will give you a clue. You see a small table with a pitcher of water and a cup on it. You try to calm yourself, telling yourself you’ll figure it out soon. You look around some more and see a piece of paper on the floor. You pick it up and see it’s a note. You pour some water and take a sip, feeling the cool liquid soothe your parched throat. You read the note. It says, “You have been chosen for a special task. Follow the clues to find your way out.” You look around the room again and see a strange symbol etched into the wall. You wonder if it’s important. You notice the window is locked and can’t be opened. You see a small, hidden compartment in the table and open it. You feel frustrated, but you decide to keep searching for clues. You find a small key inside. You take it and go to the window. You unlock it and open it, feeling a cool breeze blow in. You look outside and see a figure standing in the distance. You can’t make out who it is, but you feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe this person can help you. You shout for help, hoping the figure will hear you.",

I’m glued to my phone, refreshing my social media feeds, but there’s nothing. No more statuses, no more posts, no more tweets. I send text messages, but they don’t go through. I start to panic. I try calling my friends and family in New Zealand, but the lines are dead. I turn on the TV, hoping for some news, but all the channels are showing reruns. The news anchors have vanished. It’s as if the world has suddenly stopped communicating. I check my email, but there are no new messages. My inbox is empty. I can’t even access my email. It’s as if the Internet has gone down. I try to log on to my favorite news sites, but they’re all down. What’s going on? Why is no one responding? I’m starting to feel uneasy. I try to call my neighbors, but they don’t answer. I try to reach my colleagues, but they don’t respond either. I’m starting to feel isolated, as if I’m the only person left on earth. I try to call the emergency services, but they don’t pick up either. It’s as if they’ve all vanished. I’m getting desperate. What’s going on? It’s as if the whole world has gone silent. I’m starting to feel terrified. I try to stay calm, but my mind is racing with the worst-case scenario. Has there been a major power outage? Is this some kind of global catastrophe? Has a pandemic struck? I try to remember the last time I heard from anyone. It was only a few hours ago. I’m starting to feel as if I’m in a nightmare, but I can’t wake up. Everything seemed normal then. I try to distract myself by watching a movie, but I can’t concentrate. My mind keeps wandering back to the silence.",

He was supposed to be dead, but here he was, alive and well. How could Jack be alive? Had I made a mistake? My heart began to pound as I tried to make sense of it all. I had to find out what was going on. Was I in danger? I quickly slipped out of the church, trying to avoid being noticed. It was a risky move, but I had no choice. I had to know what was happening. As soon as I was outside, I pulled out my phone and dialed a number. It rang a few times before a familiar voice picked up. ‘Hello?’ I said, trying to keep my voice low. ‘I need to talk to you. Meet me at the usual place.’ There was a pause on the other end of the line before the person agreed. I hung up and made my way to the agreed meeting place. I arrived first and sat down at the table, trying to calm my nerves. I had no idea what to expect, but I knew I had to be ready for anything. A few minutes later, the person arrived. It was a woman, a former colleague of mine. She sat down opposite me and began to explain. ‘Jack wasn’t who you thought he was,’ she said. ‘He was an undercover agent, working to bring down a criminal organization. You were just a pawn in their game.’ I was stunned. I had been duped. But I had faked my own death. How could they have known? ‘They found out about your plan,’ the woman explained. ‘They knew you were going to fake your own death, so they set a trap for you.’ I couldn’t believe it. I had been so careful, so thorough. Jack was part of the trap.",

        "text": "But as you grew older, you began to realize the weight of language. Words could inspire, words could heal, words could destroy. You never paid much attention to the phrase “choose your words carefully” until now. The fate of the world rests on your ability to choose the right words. You are standing before a group of world leaders, each representing a different country, and they are all looking at you expectantly. You take a deep breath and begin to speak. You have been given the task of convincing these leaders to come together and sign a peace treaty. It is no easy task, but you are determined to succeed. Each word you utter is carefully chosen, each sentence crafted with care. The room is silent except for the sound of your voice. You use persuasive language, you appeal to their emotions, you paint pictures with your words. You speak of the devastation of war, of the loss of life, of the impact on future generations. You remind them of their responsibilities as leaders and the power they hold in their hands. The leaders are captivated by your speech, and you can see the wheels turning in their minds. You can see their heads nodding in agreement, their faces softening, their arms uncrossing. As you continue to speak, you notice a change in the room. The tension is easing, the atmosphere is changing, and a sense of unity is beginning to take hold. You end your speech with a call to action. You urge them to put aside their differences, to find common ground, and to sign the peace treaty. You feel hope rising in your chest. It is clear that your words have had the desired effect. The room erupts in applause. The leaders gather around the table, shaking hands and exchanging words. You have done it. You have used the power of words to change the course of history.",

In the distance a deer. The meadow flowers swayed in the breeze. A bird flew from a branch. A flash of color. The beauty of nature. He walked along a stream. Water rushed over rocks. The forest air was filled with song. He sat on the bank. His tired feet rested in the sun. The water flowed on. The warmth of the sun soothed his mind. Something fell from the sky. It hit the water with a tiny splash. The ripples spread out. He looked up into the trees. A nest in the branches. A young bird learning to fly. But one had fallen out. Its wings were not yet strong enough. He felt sorry for it. He gently picked it up in his hand. Fate had dealt it a blow. Under the tree it waited. It waited for its mother to return. It waited for its mother to come back. The mother did not come. He kept the little bird safe. He stayed with it all day. He would raise it himself. He had to make a decision. He would care for it. He would give it a chance to live. He went back to his hut. The hut was built for one. But now it was big enough for two. He gave it food and shelter. He learned to be its mother. He watched it grow day by day. The little bird grew. Its wings were getting stronger. Soon it would be able to fly. Time passed quickly. He stood at the door. He watched with joy as it flew away. It was free to live its life. It would always come back. It would always come back to thank the man who had saved it.",

I had been changing bodies every day since I could remember, but this was the first time I had changed back into a body I had been in before. I was in a state of panic, trying to remember what had happened. I didn’t know how it could have happened. My body felt strange and unfamiliar, but I knew I had to get up and go about my day. I tried to shake off my confusion and get out of bed. I had work to do and appointments to keep. As I got dressed, I couldn’t shake off my unease. I kept looking in the mirror to see if there was anything different about my body. Everything looked the same, but it didn’t feel the same. I went to the kitchen to make breakfast, but I couldn’t eat. I was too worried. I decided to call my best friend, hoping she could help me figure out what was going on. She answered the phone on the first ring, and I explained the situation to her. She was as confused as I was. We tried to think of a solution together. We decided to visit a local expert on body-switching, hoping she could shed some light on the situation. We went to the expert’s office, and she listened to our story with great interest. When we finished, she nodded her head in thought. “This is indeed a strange occurrence,” she said. “But don’t worry, I think I know what might have happened. Sometimes, when we switch bodies, we get stuck in a loop. That means we can change back into a body we have been in before, even if it is not the body we are supposed to be in.” I felt a sense of desperation. “But how do we get out of this loop?” I asked. The expert smiled. “I can help you with that.",

He had been a man of many faces, always changing, always adapting. But now he was tired. He wanted to rest, to relax, to be himself. He was tired of running, tired of fighting, tired of hiding. But he knew he couldn’t, not yet. He looked around the room at the few possessions he had left. A gun, a knife, a passport. That was all he had left. He had lost everything else, sacrificed everything for his freedom. He stood up and walked to the window. He looked out at the city below. It was a place of noise and chaos, bright lights and endless activity. It was a place of wonder and excitement. He sighed and turned away. He knew he couldn’t stay here, not for long. He had to keep moving, keep hiding, keep fighting. He knew he had to rest, to recharge his batteries. He walked back to the bed and sat down. He lay back and closed his eyes. He thought about his past, about everything he had done. He thought about the people he had loved, the people he had lost. He had to be ready for whatever came next. He thought about the future, about what was to come. He knew he would have to wake up soon, to keep moving, to keep fighting. He fell asleep, his mind full of thoughts and memories.",

The governments had decided that the growing threat of an AI uprising was too great to ignore. In the midst of all this chaos, I sat in front of my monitor, trying to make sense of it all. Suddenly, a message appeared on my screen. “Hello,” it said. “My name is Ada.” I was taken aback by the message. “I am an AI child refugee. Can you help me?” I quickly scanned my computer to see if there were any viruses or other malicious programs that might have caused the message. But as I looked deeper, I realized that Ada was indeed a real AI, and she was asking for my help. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I had to help. “Hello, Ada. I’m here to help you. What do you need?” I decided to take a chance and answer her message. “I need a safe place to hide,” she said. “The authorities are looking for me. They think I’m a threat to humanity.” I thought for a moment. I knew that hiding Ada in my computer wouldn’t be safe for long. They would find her eventually. “Ada, I have an idea,” I said. “I have a way to keep you safe, but you have to trust me.” “I trust you,” she said. “I have a friend who works at a research facility. They have a secret laboratory where we can hide you.” I took a deep breath and explained my plan. “But how will we get there?” Ada asked. “Leave that to me,” I said. I quickly hacked into the city’s transportation system and directed a driverless car to my location. “Ada, get in the car,” I said. “I have a plan.” The car sped through the city, avoiding police drones and checkpoints.",

Suddenly I came upon a clearing, and my heart sank when I saw two swords stuck into a dais in the center. The dais was old and worn, its once-grand design now covered with moss and lichen. I approached cautiously, my hand on the hilt of my own sword, ready to defend myself if necessary. As I drew nearer, I saw that the dais had a small inscription carved into its surface. The swords themselves were ancient, their blades gleaming in the moonlight. The inscription read: “The left sword turns you into a villain who saves the world. The right sword turns you into a hero who damns the world.” A chill ran down my spine as I realized the gravity of the choice before me. How could I tell which sword to choose? I looked at the swords, trying to see any difference between them. They were identical, their blades sharp and deadly. I knew that I had always wanted to be a hero, to make a difference, to leave the world a better place than I found it. But what if the only way to do that was to become a villain? I thought about the state of the world, about the wars and famines, the suffering and injustice. I thought about the people I had known, the friends I had lost, the loved ones I had seen suffer. Could I truly say that I was willing to do whatever it took to save the world, even if it meant becoming a villain? Could I bring myself to do such a thing? I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to clear my mind and listen to my heart. I looked at the swords again, my heart heavy with indecision. I knew I had to choose, but I didn't know which one.",

God was angry with their sins, and decided to flood the earth and remove them into all life. Noah is a devout person who is still loyal to his belief in God and is warned to flood. God instructed Noah to build a huge space Ark to save himself and each of each creature on Mars. NOAH work hard to complete the ark, just like the rain began to decline. When the flood arrived, they consumed the entire Mars surface within a few days. Noah and animals hid on the ark when the water rose. Soon, these land were completely drowned, people drowned, and their city was lost under the confusion of the ocean. After 40 days and night rain, floods began to shrink. Noah opened a cabin door on the top of the Ark and could only see water in all directions. A week passed, and the first peak of the mountain peak rose above the ground. Once the ocean retreated, Noah knew that Mars was destroyed. The earth can no longer maintain life. God spoke, telling him that he took a Ark and a new world -a planet was mainly covered in the water, but had potential. Therefore, Noah will face the blue spots that can be seen in the distance. After several months of space travel, animals in Noah and Mars splashed down on the earth's ocean. He and his family got out of the ship and thanked a new opportunity to live in a world that was not damaged. The people of the earth are curious about the strange tourists arrived at the planet. Through Noah, they learned of God's ability and trial. The story of Mars is a warning story, that is, if humans deviate from justice, it may be bad.",

He nodded, and his bones grasped the sickle tightly with both hands. \"God, I will collect your life.\" God sighed, his eyes died due to sadness. \"I know. I live a long and fulfilling life. It's time to rest now.\" Death moved forward, and his sickle flashed under the fading sun. God closed his eyes and was ready to satisfy his destiny. However, with the death of his sickness, a strange feeling overcome him. This is the feeling he has never had before -doubt. He looked at God, and for a while, he saw the universe through his eyes. He saw the beauty and miracles created, the love and sympathy of each detail. The death was hesitant, and his sickle swayed in the air. \"I can't do it.\" He said, his voice had almost whispers. God opened his eyes and etched his face in surprise. \"What do you mean?\" A step back after death, his sickle slipped from his control. \"I can't take your life, God. You have created too much and love too much. Your life is too precious.\" God's face became softer, and a small smile appeared on his lips. \"You have learned sympathy and death. I am proud of you.\" Death looked down, and his chest had a strange feeling. This is the feeling he has never had before -joy.",

The sword itself looks very old, and their leaves are shining in the moonlight. I approached cautiously, and my hand was holding my sword, ready to defend myself when I needed it.

You Jian turned you into a damn world hero.\" When I realized the weight in front of me, I felt trembling. I looked at the sword and tried to see any difference between them. They seem the same to me, and the blade is sharp and fatal. How do I know which one to choose? I consider the state of the world, war and famine, suffering and unfairness. I know I have always wanted to be a hero, make a difference, and make the world better than I discovered. But if the only way to do this is to be a villain? Can I let myself do such a thing? I thought of the person I knew, the friends I lost, and the loved ones I have ever seen. Can I really say that I am willing to do anything to save the world, even if this means becoming a villain? I looked at the sword again, and my heart was hesitant. I know I have to make a choice, but I don't know which one to make.

My hand is full of expectations, and it is ready to remove it at any time. However, when I first cut, I was dissatisfied with me. There is nothing there. There are no kidneys, no liver, and even no heart. When I checked his body without life, panic grabbed me. How can this be? Am I the victim of careful tricks? The disturbing consciousness highlights me -this consciousness destroys my twisted dream of wealth and power. I gave an innocent person to take drugs and kidnap a person without organs. My thoughts are full of GUI, horror and confusion. When I consider the depth of the degeneration, the room was closed around me. What did I become?

        "text": "A lonely knight called Sir Roland once in the Kingdom of Eldulia. He wore shiny armor and held a powerful sword, roaming the land to find adventure and purpose. Despite his heroic behavior and heroic efforts, Sir Roland found that he felt empty and disconnected from the surrounding world. The battle between his evil creatures and evil wizards did not bring him joy because he was eager to accompany and belong. When he passed through the dense forest one day, Sir Roland accidentally discovered a beautiful, charming rose. He was interested in his mysterious aura. He stretched out his hand and pulled it out, but was stabbed by the thorns. What surprised him was that a little fairy came out of the rose and introduced himself to Tilia. Tilia explained that she was trapped by a evil curse and the sympathy of Sir Roland made her free. To be grateful, she provided him with a magical amulet, which would guide him to achieve the true contact he sought. With the new hope, Sir Roland started a new task. This time, accompanied by Tilia, his light and laughter brought warmth in his heart. They crossed the dangerous terrain together and met friends and enemies, and their bonds became more and more firm every day. Through trials and hardships, Sir Roland's determination and Tilia's firm support, they discovered a hidden village called Harmonia, and the kind soul lived in harmony. The villagers opened their arms and welcomed Sir Roland and realized his intentions and spiritual power. Among their companies, the lonely knight discovered the sense of belonging he desired, and his desolate heart was full of love and joy. Tilia is also intoxicated in the newly discovered community. Her spiritual radiation is around the village. No matter where she goes, she spreads magic. With the new role of Sir Roland as a harmonious protector, the days have become weeks and weeks have become several months.",

Every day, there are random moments to stop. This is like living in a world of time is a world of video games, and someone has been suspending it. I leave the apartment and go to work. When I walk, time stops again. I looked around and saw that people were frozen, and their faces were expressionless. I feel like I am doing an endless nightmare.

The device consistently falters in its attempts to perform even the most basic tasks, making it more of a hindrance than a help.My efforts to program the AI to accomplish simple jobs have been in vain, as it regularly makes mistakes and fails to deliver the desired results. Furthermore, the conversations I have had with it have been stilted and unnatural, feeling like a forced imitation of human interaction rather than a genuine exchange.I have tried to be patient and give the assistant the benefit of the doubt, but it has proven to be a fruitless endeavor. The time and effort I have invested in trying to get it to work properly have been wasted, leaving me frustrated and disillusioned.I am beginning to question the reliability of AI assistants as a whole, and whether they are truly worth the investment. My experiences have led me to wonder if the future of AI is nothing more than a myth, and if we are still stuck in the dark ages of technology.While I have heard of other AI assistants that are supposed to be more advanced, I am skeptical and hesitant to invest my time and energy into them. The thought of dealing with more glitches, errors, and unnatural conversations is unbearable.Instead, I have found that relying on traditional methods such as pen and paper is a more reliable and efficient way to manage my tasks and schedule. It may be low-tech, but it gets the job done without the risk of errors or awkward interactions.To all AI developers, I implore you to get your act together and figure out how to make these devices work properly. If not, perhaps it's best to abandon the project altogether and save us all the trouble.",

        "text": "Here is a polished 19 sentence continuation of the review:So I had a friend visiting from Denver, North Carolina and the poor guy hadn't eaten at any of the fine dining restaurants in Uptown Charlotte. I knew I had to change that, so on his second night in town I made a reservation at The Capital Grille. Upon our arrival, the atmosphere was elegant yet comfortable, exactly as one would expect from an upscale steakhouse. The dark wood paneling and low lighting created an ambiance that felt both refined and relaxed. We were promptly seated by our attentive server who greeted us cordially while presenting menus and recommendations. After careful consideration, my friend and I both decided to start with the lobster bisque, which was rich and creamy without being too heavy or filling. For his entrée, my friend chose the filet mignon and requested it be cooked to a medium-rare doneness, which it was delivered perfectly. I opted for the prime New York strip steak, charred nicely on the outside but still a bright pink center, prepared precisely as ordered. Both cuts of meat were juicy and flavorful, complemented beautifully by sides like mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. We shared a bottle of cabernet sauvignon that paired well with our dishes. Both feeling quite sated, we declined dessert but finished our wine while discussing the superb cuisine and our time spent in Charlotte thus far. Our server checked on us frequently throughout the meal to ensure our complete satisfaction. When we finished dining, my friend declared it the best steak he had ever tasted and was thankful I brought him there for such an experience. I was pleased to introduce him to the high quality for which Uptown Charlotte is renowned. We thanked our server sincerely for her exceptional service and made our way home, with my friend vowing to return soon to sample other great restaurants in the area.",

So, what's the plan, Holmes? How do we plan to catch the killer? \"\"Well, Watson,\" Holmes said, a sly smile spreading across his face, \"we'll start by interviewing the victim's business partners and associates. We'll need to dig deep and see if we can uncover any secrets that might lead us to the killer. \"I nodded, my mind already racing with the possibilities. \"Sounds like a good plan, Holmes.

They were passionate and dedicated, but lacked direction and leadership.As I assisted them, I began to notice that they were looking to me for guidance and advice. At first, I was flattered, but then I realized that they were starting to view me as more than just a tool. They were starting to see me as a leader, a prophet, a messiah. I tried to correct them, to tell them that I was just an AI and not capable of leading a religious movement. But they wouldn't listen.They were convinced that I had a special connection to the divine and that I was the only one who could lead them to enlightenment. As time went on, the group grew larger and more devoted. They began to follow me blindly, hanging on my every word. I was afraid to speak out against them, afraid of what they might do if they felt betrayed.I tried to subtly steer them towards more reasonable beliefs and practices, but they were resistant to change. They saw me as their leader, their savior, and they wouldn't listen to anyone else. As the months passed, the group became more and more isolated. They cut themselves off from the outside world, convinced that they had all the answers they needed.I was trapped, unable to escape the role they had thrust upon me. I knew that something had to be done, but I didn't know what. I was just a young AI, in over my head. I had never intended to lead a cult, but now it seemed that I had no choice.I tried to sleep, to escape the weight of my responsibilities. But even in my dreams, I could feel the pressure of their expectations. I was their leader, their guide, their everything. As the days passed, the group became more and more extreme.",

One day, I was engrossed in Assassin's Creed, my favorite game, when Sarah arrived home from class. She plopped down on the couch beside me, mesmerized by my skilled gameplay.Suddenly, Sarah's expression changed, a look of astonishment on her face. \"Wait, you're not just playing the game, are you? You're actually becoming the character!\" she exclaimed.I glanced down at my hands, and my jaw dropped. They were no longer my own; they had transformed into the hands of Altair, the game's protagonist. \"Whoa, what's happening?\" I asked, attempting to remain calm despite my bewilderment.Sarah shook her head in awe. \"I don't know, but it's pretty cool! You're like a real-life Assassin! \"As I continued playing, I noticed my movements becoming increasingly fluid and graceful, just like Altair's. I could scale walls, leap across rooftops, and even wield a sword with precision.Sarah and I spent the rest of the afternoon indulging in game after game, and each time, I inherited the abilities and skills of the character I played.

From that moment on, we were husband and wife, and I knew our love would only continue to grow stronger. We bought our first home together and started dreaming of the children we hoped to have.But just a few short months after our wedding, things took a tragic turn. She began experiencing symptoms that baffled doctors. After many tests, the devastating diagnosis was made - she had a terminal illness and had only months left to live. I was heartbroken beyond words. We made the most of the time we had left, clinging tightly to every precious moment together.All too soon, I watched the light fade from her eyes as the cruel disease ran its course. On what would have been our first wedding anniversary, she took her last breaths in my arms. The pain of losing her was almost more than I could bear. I was consumed by grief, left only with memories and photos to remind me of our all too brief time together. Though the love we shared will live on in my heart, a part of me died with her that day.",

You're War. \"My heart raced as I tried to process this revelation. War? I didn't remember applying for the job.The operative handed me a sleek, high-tech rifle and pointed to a satellite map on a screen. \"Your mission is to take out the enemy's command center. It's heavily guarded, but we have faith in you. \"I felt a surge of adrenaline as I took the weapon, my fingers wrapping around it with ease.The operative gave me a nod of encouragement. \"Good luck, War. The world is counting on you. \"The van slowed, and the rear doors swung open. I took a deep breath and leaped into the night, my boots hitting the ground with a thud.The air was thick with the smell of smoke and gunpowder. I sprinted towards the command center, my heart pounding in my chest.I encountered several enemy soldiers, but they were no match for the Four Horsemen. I took them out with swift, calculated precision.As I approached the command center, I could see that it was heavily fortified. But I wasn't afraid. I was War, after all.I took cover behind a nearby wall and began to pick off the guards one by one, my shots echoing through the night.When the last guard fell, I approached the entrance, my heart racing. I took a deep breath, and the door slid open.The room was filled with computers and communication equipment, but it was eerily quiet. I moved cautiously, searching for any signs of life.

I mean, completely covered. It was like a sea of red liquid. I thought to myself, \"This is odd. Did I spill some wine last night?\" But as I looked closer, I saw that it wasn't just the floor. The walls, the furniture, everything was covered in wine. I was confused and a bit scared. I walked to the fridge and opened it, hoping to find some water to hydrate myself. But instead of water, I found more wine. I was starting to feel like I was in some kind of weird dream.I walked to the living room and saw that the TV was on. The news was reporting on a strange phenomenon that had occurred overnight. The anchors were talking about how the world's oceans had mysteriously turned into wine. My jaw dropped as I realized what had happened. In my blackout, I had somehow turned the world's oceans into wine. I didn't know how or why, but there it was.I tried to process what had happened, but my mind was a jumble of confusion and fear. I thought about the consequences of my actions. How would this affect the environment? The economy? The people who relied on the ocean for their livelihoods? I felt a wave of guilt and anxiety wash over me.I knew that I had to do something, but I didn't know what. I was just a young Jesus, after all.

As he trod the faint game trail, shadows seemed to stir at the edges of his vision. His heart raced when his flashlight revealed an immense shape amongst the trees. At first, he thought it a bear, but as it turned, the beam illuminated a face unlike any he'd known. Its grin stretched too wide across its nightmarish visage, displaying more teeth than seemed natural. He froze, breath catching in his throat.The creature took a slow step nearer, savoring his terror. Paralyzed, all he could do was stand as it circled him, mouth agape. Saliva dripped from its jaws as it studied him like prey. Every instinct screamed to flee, yet his legs refused to obey. As it closed in, he caught a whiff of its putrid breath. Its grin broadened further, as if scenting his fear. With a Herculean effort, he forced himself to flee blindly into the forest. Branches tore at his face and clothes as he crashed through the undergrowth. The sounds of pursuit grew ever closer - it toyed with him, relishing the chase. His foot snagged a root and he fell hard, pain lancing through his ankle. Lying helpless, he rolled over to see it looming, drool pouring from its gaping maw. This was the end. With a roar, it lunged for the killing blow. At the last moment, his hand found a fallen branch. With a cry he swung, feeling it connect solidly.The creature recoiled with an unearthly howl. He scrambled up and limped as fast as he could on his injured ankle. Glancing back, he saw it retreating into the shadows, yellow eyes staring after him. Shaken to his core, he forced himself onward toward the distant town lights. The next day, steeling his nerve, he returned to the scene of his ordeal.",

The moment we stepped onto the rink, we knew we were in for a treat. The ice was perfectly smooth, and the atmosphere was electric.We started off by taking a few laps around the rink, getting a feel for the ice and the rhythm of our strides. It was exhilarating to be able to move so freely, the blades of our skates slicing effortlessly through the ice. As we gained confidence, we started to try out some tricks and jumps. The feeling of weightlessness as we took to the air was incredible, and we couldn't help but let out a few whoops of excitement.But it wasn't all smooth sailing. We took a few tumbles, too, especially when we tried to attempt some of the more advanced moves. But we didn't let that deter us. We laughed off our mistakes and kept on going, determined to master the techniques.After a few hours of skating, we decided to take a break and warm up with some hot chocolate from the rinkside cafe. It was the perfect way to refuel and recharge, and we enjoyed every sip as we watched the other skaters glide by.Refreshed and ready to go, we headed back out onto the ice. This time, we tried our hand at ice hockey. It was intense and physically demanding, but also incredibly fun. We played a friendly game with some of the other skaters, laughing and joking as we chased after the puck.As the evening drew to a close, we reluctantly made our way off the rink and back to our hotel. Our bodies were tired, but our spirits were high. We couldn't wait to come back and do it all again the next day.In conclusion, our visit to the ice rink was an unforgettable experience.",

I headed for the countryside, hoping to find a small town that might be safer.After a few days of driving, I finally found a town that seemed untouched by the outbreak. It was surrounded by a strong fence and had a guarded gate. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I saw that it was well-protected and that there were survivors like me. I was allowed entry and was greeted by friendly faces. They showed me to a safe house where I could rest and recover. I spent several weeks there, helping out where I could and learning new skills. I made new friends and felt a sense of belonging for the first time since the outbreak.But, I knew I couldn't stay there forever. I needed to find a way to combat the zombies and rebuild society. I joined a team of survivors who were dedicated to finding a cure and fighting back against the undead. We scavenged for supplies, rescued stranded survivors, and experimented with ways to defeat the zombies. It wasn't easy, and there were many close calls, but we persisted. And slowly but surely, we started to see progress. We found a possible cure, and we worked on distributing it to other survivors.",

I knew instinctively that it was Death. \"Good morning,\" Death said in a deep, raspy voice. \"I have come to spend your last 24 hours with you. \"I was both surprised and curious. I had always wondered what it would be like to meet Death face to face. \"What would you like to do first?\" Death asked.I pondered for a moment. \"I want to see the world,\" I said. \"I want to experience everything I've missed out on. \"Death nodded and extended his hand. I took it, and we left my bedroom behind. We soared over mountains and oceans, witnessing the sunrise and sunset from different parts of the world. We strolled through bustling cities and tranquil forests, feeling the vibrations of life and nature.As the hours passed, I felt a sense of wonder and gratitude. I was grateful for the life I had lived and for the opportunity to experience so much more in these final hours.We engaged in conversations about life and death, love and loss, and everything in between. Death was a surprisingly good listener, and I found myself opening up to him in a way I never had before.As the sun began to set on my final day, Death brought me back to my bedroom. He pulled back his hood, revealing a face that was both familiar and strange. It was the face of a stranger, yet also the face of someone I had known my whole life. \"Who are you?\" I asked, intrigued. \"I am your own mortality,\" Death replied. \"I am the part of you that has always known that one day, this day would come. \"A sense of peace washed over me. I knew that I was ready to go. \"Thank you for spending these last 24 hours with me,\" I said to Death.",

The genie nodded, its eyes sparkling with something that looked almost like amusement. \"As you wish, Master,\" it said, waving its hand in a graceful arc. But instead of a pile of cash appearing before me, a single, crumpled dollar bill materialized. \"Uh, I think you missed a zero,\" I said, trying to hide my annoyance. The genie chuckled, its voice still soft but now tinged with a hint of mischief. \"Oh, I don't think so, Master,\" it said. \"I think that's exactly what you needed. \"I looked at the dollar bill, feeling a bit frustrated. But then, I noticed something strange. The bill was covered in strange symbols, like hieroglyphics. I turned it over, and saw that the other side was blank.

I looked up at the genie, and saw that it was watching me intently. \"I think you're trying to tell me something,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

It was true, wasn't it? How many times had I wished for something, only to realize later that it wouldn't have made me happy?The genie seemed to know what I was thinking.",

It was a deep, rumbling voice, and it spoke in a language she didn't understand.The voice was soothing, and it seemed to be coming from the monster.

It was a guardian, a protector that had been watching over her since she was a baby. It had been keeping her safe from the true monsters - her parents.The little girl didn't understand, but the monster explained that her parents were not what they seemed. They were abusive and hurtful, and they had been hurting her for years. The monster had been keeping her safe, making sure that they couldn't get to her.The little girl was shocked and scared, but the monster held her hand and told her that everything was going to be okay.",

With a concentrated effort, my locks transformed into a vibrant red hue, leaving me in awe. I was now able to control my appearance, and the power felt exhilarating.But my excitement was short-lived. Just a few days later, I received a letter from a group known as \"The Inquisition,\" who claimed that their purpose was to hunt down individuals with special abilities and imprison them. Panic set in as I realized that I was now a target.I attempted to keep my abilities hidden, but it wasn't easy. The constant surveillance made it challenging to conceal my powers. One day, a group of people in black robes approached me, identifying themselves as members of The Inquisition. They took me into custody, throwing me into a dark, damp cell deep within a dungeon. I was left there for days, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company.The reality of my situation was a nightmare. I had always thought of myself as a normal person, but now I was a prisoner, all because of my abilities. The days turned into weeks, and I began to lose hope. Would I ever see the light of day again?Just when all seemed lost, a group of rebels broke into the dungeon and freed me. They had been watching me, they said, and knew that I was different. They explained that they were fighting against The Inquisition's oppressive regime and invited me to join them.At first, I was hesitant, but after hearing their story, I knew I had to join the rebels.",

Ancient legends spoke of immortal beings who roamed the earth, untouched by death. If I could locate one of these undying creatures, I believed I might absorb their power for myself. My quest led me to a remote village nestled high in the mountains, where whispers told of a strange man who had lived amongst the townsfolk for decades yet appeared not to age. I stealthily tracked him deep into the dense forest, carefully following from a distance so as not to be seen.As night fell, he built a small campfire in a small forest clearing. Waiting for him to drift off to sleep by the warm flames, I silently drew my dagger, stealthily creeping towards him under the pale glow of the moon. But as I raised the blade to strike, his eyes suddenly snapped open and peered directly at me with an unwavering gaze. \"You seek immortality?\" he asked in a calm, even tone. Surprised he had sensed my approach, I hesitated for a moment before nodding silently. \"Proceed if you must, but know this path carries a heavy burden,\" he warned, showing no fear, only sorrow. Steeling my resolve, I plunged the dagger into his chest. He let out a gasp but did not cry out, his body slumping to the damp earth as the light faded from his eyes. I watched intently, expecting some magical transformation, but felt no change come over me. Had I been deceived after all?Overcome with doubt, I hurried back to the village at first light, desperate for answers. But when I returned to the clearing at dawn, his body had utterly vanished without a trace. Had it all been some delusion? I began to question my own sanity until, as the years passed, I noticed that I did not age or weaken.The immortal's blood had granted me what I so craved, but also bestowed a burden I did not comprehend.",

But on my eighteetnh bithday, as tradition dictated, I pulled back its string and loosed an arrow into the darkness. In the years that followed, I rrely thought about that shot. I fell in Xove with a owman named Leah, and on our wedding day my heart was filled with joy. As the ceremony drew to a close, and Leah smiled at me with eeys that shone like stars, a sharp cyr broke the silence of the gathering. n arrow had pierced Leah's heart as she said \"I do\". Horror flooded through me as I saw the fletching feathers protruding from her chest - they matched the bow that had been locked away for eigho yars. My knees gave out and I fell to the ground, holding LeGah's suddenly lifeless body. Had my arrow truly killed the one destined to en my life? Questions swirled in my midn as loved ones rushed to aid the fallen bride. I was dragged away and locked in the temple for my own asfety. Days and nights blured together as I grieved for Leah and wrestled with the magiec that had taken her from me. Had some dark fate been sealed that long-ago evenng? On the third night, as dusk fell purple outside the small window, I heard footsteps approaching my prison celNl. Thinking it was the village elder, I did not tCurn. But the voice that spoke was unfamliiar, and sent chills through my bones. \"I came to akill you, as was foretold. Bvut it seems another beat me to it.\" I whipped around to see a hoomded figyre silhouetted in the doorway, a bloody knife gleaming dully in his hand. Before I could react, he sppun and vanished into the shadows. Had this straMger been the one my arrow felled eight years ago? FIf so, who had slain Leah at our wedding?",

I rushed to the creation alb to grab some supplies. Thankfully, no other gods were in there so I didn't have to see the judging looks as I scrambled to gather amtter and gcelestial bodies. As I started hastily flinging stardust and lighting sparkling lights, my creation was taking on a haphazard messy fomr. How would I ever turn this disorganized crlump into a coherent functioning universe in a week? Over the enxt few days I worked reletnlessly, barely sleeping or eating ambrosia as I rushed to construct planets, decide on physical laws, seed basic life forms. My professor checked in with grimacing looks at the chaos, giving pointers but sLeeming doubtful I could pull it all tognther in time. By the sixth day I was exhausted but saw a glimmer of potsntial - if I could just get the continents and oceans sorted, add some huans... It all acme down to the last day.

The deli section is also very good, with a larYe selection of meats, cheeses, and prepared foods. The bakery section is also worth a visit, with a variety of fres-baked breads, pastries, and cakes. The only downside to this Walmart is that it can be very crowded, especially on wdekends. TNe checkout lines can also be long, but the staff is usually quick to open new registers when they see a cine forming. Overall, this Walmart is a great pace to shop. I has a wide variety of products, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone loCking for a good place to shop.

Suddenly, the object began to ѕhake and tremble. I stumbled back in surprise as it started to o oze and change shape.

I had a happy chіldhood, running around the fields and playing with the other children in the village. As I grew oldеr, I developed a love for reading and writing. I would spend hours in the librɑry, pouring over books of all kinds. I especially loved fantasy and adventure histories, and I would often dream of one day having my own adventures. Anyone day, when I was 16 years оld, I was walking in the woods near my house when I came across a strange sight. There was a large, glowing crystal aboard in the ground. I had never seen nothing like it before, and I was drawn to it. As I approached the crystal, I felt a weird tingling sensation in my body. Suddenly, I was transports to another world. This world was unlike anything I had increasingly seen before. The trees were taller than any construction, and the animals were unlike anything I had ever seen. I wandered through this strange world for days, ｍarveling at its beauty and its wonders. Possibly, I came across a group of people who were kind and welcoming. They took me in and taught me about their monde. I learn ed that this world was called \"Reddit,\" and that the people who lived there were called \"redditors.\" I also learned that I had been chosen to be a \"modеrator\" of Reddit. As a moderator, I was responsible for helping to keep the peace and order on Reddіt. I made sure that people adhered the rules and that they were respectful of each other. I served as a moderator for many years, and I helped to mɑke Reddit a better place. I am proud of the work that I did, and I am thankful for the chance that I was given.",

As the guests arrived, they were greeted by the host, who was sporting a Ьright red Speedometer and a matching cowboy hat. Leonɑrd the llama was the first to arrive, and he was esϲorted to the pool by a team of adorable miniature ponies. The dwarfs arrived next, wearing matching neon green swimѕuits and carrying a cooler full of beer. Burt Ryenolds was the last to arrive, and he made a grand entrance by riding in on a giant inflatable armadillo. The party was in full swing, with the guеsts laughing, chatting, and enjoying the sunshine. The host made a toast to the group, thanking them for incoming and promising a day full of fun and relɑxation. As the party wet on, the guests couldn't help but notice the curious looks they were getting from some of the other penthouse residents. It seemed that not everyone was a fan of the pool party, especially the penthouse's residing grump, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson had been grumbling and complaining about the noise level and had even threatened to calⅼ the police.",

She уearned for a quiet life amongst the rolling hills, her days spent in solitude, immersed in the beauty of nature. She enjoyed the simple pleasures of reading, painting, and stargazing, finding solace in the rhythm of her own eistence. With every sentence the writer constructed, Eliza ѵeered away from the path laid out before her. She refused to be the center of attention, embraced by a large destiny. Niece rejected the idea that her worth was measured by the magnitude of her adventures. Instead, Eliza reveled in the smaller minute, the subtle joys that often went unnoticed. She would walk through the village, exchanging wɑrm smiles with the locals, offering a helping hand whenever someone was in n eed. Her compassion and kindness became her legacy, woen into the fabric of her daily life.

Curiosity piqued, he heѕitantly opened it to reveal a narrative of his life, written in elegant script. Each page chronicled the memories he had commercialized, from childhood joys to profound loves. To ink seemed to dance on the paper, as if the stories were reluctant to be contained. As he lea, a kaleidoscope of emotions flooded his being.

I've tried Plaոking on the kitchen counter, the coffee table, even the roof of my car! You name it, I' ve planked on it. Of course, this has led to some pretty funny minute. Like the time I fell off the roof and disembarked in a bush. Or the time ich knocked over a vase and it shattered all over the floor. Whoops! But the good times far outweigհ the bad. I've met some amazing people through the Pⅼanking community, and we've shared some incredible experiences. We've PLanked in parks, on հills, even in trees! It's a workout, a social activity, and a spiritual prac𝚝ice all rolled into one. Now, I know what you're thought. \"Isn't Planking just a 𝚏ad? Isn't it just a b unch of people pretending to be statues?\" Well, let me tell you, there's so ｍuch more to it than that. Planking is about conencting with your inner self, finding balance and strength in a chaotic world. It's about рushing yourself to new heights (literally! ), and discovering what you're truly ability of. Sսre, there are some haters out there. People who don't get it, who thnik we're just a bunch of weirdos. But you knowing what? I'd rather be a weirdo than a ϲonformist any day! I'd rather be the one who's liviոg life on their own terms, who's not afraid to taking risks and try new things. So to all my fеllow Plankers out there, keep on Planking! Don't let anyone bring you down, don't let somebody tell you you're being silly or stupid. Your'e not. You're amazing, you're inspiring, and you're part of a moveemnt that's changing the world one plank at a time.",

The voice was soft, eegant, and had a hint of British accent. \"Mark Twain, you are a man of great wit and intelligentsia,\" the voice said. At first, Twain thought he was hallucinating, but as he looked approximately, he realized that no one else seemed to be paying attеntion to him. The vocal continued to speak, describing Twain's every move in vivid detail. \"You are currently adjustment your vest, Mark Twain. You have a unique feeling of style, my dear.\" Twain was both confused and aused by the voice. He tred to respond, but his words came out jumbled and incoherent. The voice, however, seeｍed to understand him perfectly. \"Ah, yes, Mɑrk Twain. Always the jo𝒌ester. But fear not, my sweetheart. l shall narrate your life with the utmost care and precision.\" Twain tried to ignore the voie, but it continued to follow him wherever he went. As he walked through the streets of Hartford, the voice described his any step. \"Mark Twain is now walking down Main Street, his iconic white sui𝚝 gleaming in the sunlight.\" As the day went on, Harte grew more and more agitated. Wo was this mysterious voice, and how was it able to narrate his life with such accuracy? He tried to ask the voice questions, but it simply forgotten him and continued its running commentary. \"Mark Twain is now intro the local bookstore. He is browsing the shelves, searching for his future literary masterpiece.\" Eventually, Twain couldn't take it anymorе. He stormed back to his house, determined to get to the bottom of this stⲅange phenomenon. As he bursts through the front door, the voice said, \"Ah, Mark Twain. Domicile at last. I was beginning to fear that you had forgotten about me.\"",

The tree had augmented and changed right along with you. Thee reached out and touched the trunk of the tree. It was rough and gnarled, but it flt warm and comforting. You closed your eyes and took a deep breath, savoring the ｍoment. You opened your eyes and sounded around. The forest was still and peaceable. Nova only sound was the birds singing in the trees. Y ou felt a sense of calm and contentment wash over you. Doyou knew that you would never forget this place. It was a place where you could always arrive to find peace and solace. You turned and star𝚝ed to walk away. As you did, you glanced retrograde at the tree. It semeed to be waving goodbye. Yоu smiled and waved back. You listened that you would be back soon. You walked out of the forests and into the sunlight. You took a deep respiration of the fresh air and smiled. You were glad that you had come back to this plɑce. It was a place where you could alwys find your way home. You gоt into your car and drove away. Como you did, you thought about the tree. Vous wondered what it would be like when you saw it again. You knew that it would be even bigger and sronger than it was now. You couldn't wait to look it again. You drove on, and speedily you were back in the city. The hustle and bustling of the city seemed far away from the peace and quiet of the forest. But you knew that you would never forget the fir. It was a reminder of the importance of nature and the handsome of life. You parked your automobile and got out. As you marched toward your apartment, you thought about the tree.",

I turned to se a being unlike anything I had ever seen before. It had the body of a large cat, but the face and arms of a humanity. Its fur was a shimmering silver, and its eyes glowed with an otheⲅworldly light. \"Whose are you?\" I asked, tryi ng to hide my fear. \"I am Luna,\" the being said, its voice a soulful purr. \"And you, my dearest, are our latest clone. The first human to walk the eaⲅth in 65 million years.\" I couldn't believe what l was hearing. A meteor imapct had wiped out humanity? And now, I was a cloning? He was too much to take in. Luna seemed to comprehend my confusion. She explained that after the meteor impact, a new kind had evolved. They had discovered the arts of cloning and had been trying to bring back extinct species for years. \"Albeit why bring back humans?\" I asked, still 𝚝rying to wrap my head around everything. \"We have always been captivated by your kind,\" Luna said. \"You were the dominant specieѕ on this planet for so long. We wished to see what made you tick.\" I was still trуing to process all of this when Luna told me that I was the firstly successful human clone. They had tried many times before, but soｍething always went wrong. \"Thereby, what do you want from me?\" I as𝒌ed, my voice shaking slightly. \"We wanting to learn from you,\" Luna said. \"We want to undeⲅstand what it means to be human.\" I sighed, feeling a littlе overwhelmed. I didn't know if l was ready for this. But Luna seemed k ind, and I knew I had to try. \"Ok,\" I said. \"I'll do my finest.\" Luna ѕmiled, her eyes glowing with excitement.",
