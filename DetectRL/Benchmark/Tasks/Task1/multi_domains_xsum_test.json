There's a clue there.\"What I will say is that all the characters are exactly where you would want them to be.\"The strength of this new script is the fact that the narrative is a bit stronger than it was in the original.\"He added: \"You learn a lot about Renton, Sick Boy and indeed Begbie and where their heads are.\"I think it's an absolutely fantastic script. John Hodge has done a wonderful job, as he did with the original.\"McGregor has said he does not have any nerves about returning to the part of Renton.Speaking to the Press Association ahead of the release of his new movie Our Kind Of Traitor, he said: \"It's such an amazing script, penned by John Hodge who wrote the original Trainspotting script, so there's a real excitement about it.\"Like every movie you do, you have things to think about leading up to them. There is a nervousness about it, but I'm not nervous because it's a sequel to Trainspotting.\"",

We're very positive that we believe it can happen and it's coming true.\"",

We are a much smaller authority and we are aware of the problems. We will welcome external support if that's what's required.\"",

It described the claim that employees brought files to Uber with the goal of creating \"copycat\" technology as \"demonstrably false.\"Mr. Levandowski has declined to testify in the case, launched in February.The firing was confirmed by an Uber spokeswoman, who said it was effective Tuesday.Mr Levandowski had already been removed from working on the self-driving car technology at the heart of the suit.He started working at Uber in August 2016, when the firm bought Otto, the self-driving truck start-up he had created in the six months after leaving Google.He declined to testify earlier this year, citing his right to avoid self-incrimination.Uber maintains its technology is different to Waymo's and says there isn't evidence the files are on its servers. But its search did not include Mr Levandowski's computer.Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case in San Francisco, earlier ordered Uber to return the thousands of \"pilfered\" files in question by the end of the month.A spokeswoman for Uber said the firing occurred after Mr Levandowski failed to meet the deadline that would allow Uber to cooperate with the judge's order.Word of the firing was sent to employees on Tuesday.Attorneys for Mr Levandowski could not be reached for comment immediately.",

Russia made an advance payment of about €840m.The first of two - the Vladivostok - was supposed to be delivered to Russia in November 2014.Vladimir Kozhin, a military technology adviser to Mr Putin, said on Friday that negotiations over compensation were \"completely finished\".\"Everything has already been decided, both the time-frame and the amount,\" Mr Kozhin told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.But Mr Hollande's comments suggest that the agreement is still in question.Sources close to the talks, quoted by Russia's Kommersant daily, have suggested France will compensate Russia to the tune of €1.16bn.That sum includes the amount that Russia has already spent on special training for 400 sailors, on port infrastructure in Vladivostok for the two warships and on developing four prototype Ка-52К helicopters.The compensation deal was discussed last week at talks between Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and French Defence Secretary-General Louis Gautier, Kommersant reports.The Mistral contract dates back to a June 2011 agreement reached under the previous French President, Nicolas Sarkozy.Western sanctions have been ratcheted up against Russia since March 2014, when the Ukrainian conflict erupted with Russia's annexation of Crimea.Russia denies backing pro-Russian separatist rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine.",

I am not in hiding.\"He said that he would like to go to Estonia to \"defend his rights\".Estonian law enforcement officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.According to Estonian media, Mr Haidari was investigated for embezzlement and tax evasion from the time when he was director of dairy firm Rapla Dairy. The company went bankrupt in 2003.Court proceedings began against Mr Haidari, and he eventually fled Estonia, local media said.He was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison in 2011, reports said.The news of the charges is an embarrassment for the new President Ghani, who wants to change the political culture in Afghanistan by appointing people who are both qualified and clean, the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul reports.No ministers are yet in place almost four months after the new Afghan government was sworn in, and there is a growing sense that the government is drifting, our correspondent adds.President Ghani announced his cabinet nominations on Monday some three months after he was sworn in, following tortuous negotiations with former rival and current government chief executive Abdullah Abdullah.",

We need to stop this abuse.\"Today's proposals follow a major review of the system, and are aimed at a more selective system and, crucially, reducing the numbers to meet our target of reducing net migration to sustainable levels.\"But the Institute for Public Policy Research said cutting the numbers of foreign students would have a limited effect on net migration levels.Associate director Sarah Mulley  said: \"Foreign students contribute a huge amount to the UK education sector and to the wider economy.\"It is right to clamp down on abuse of the visa system but these proposals are driven primarily by the government's objective of reducing net migration by more than half.\"In its efforts to meet this objective, the government risks causing significant harm to a highly-successful export sector at a time when the economy is still vulnerable.\"",

Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket.2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault.Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles.

The abuse from the travelling support directed at him in the recent draw with Rotherham was vociferous and I understand that his position was very much hanging in the balance from then on.Coyle can rightly claim that he wasn't backed in terms of budget. He was given £250,000 to spend in the summer while he recouped in excess of £10m and the January transfer window saw him frustrated that the club failed to land his list of potential targets.The fact that Rovers haven't been higher than 20th all season is the reason behind his departure. Financially they can ill afford relegation to League One, and whoever comes in has 15 games to save them.Since the takeover of the club by Venky's in November 2010, the club are now looking to appoint a seventh permanent manager.",

They could be like sports doping tests, the paper said.A Germanwings co-pilot deliberately crashed a plane in the Alps in March.It remains unclear why he did so.Andreas Lubitz, 27, is thought to have suffered some sort of mental breakdown. Prosecutors in Duesseldorf found evidence of \"an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment\".

Germanwings is a budget airline managed by Lufthansa.In the FAZ interview, Mr Spohr said unannounced medical checks for pilots could be introduced, which in terms of the surprise factor would be similar to doping tests for sports men and women.He said that in certain cases a doctor might have to be released from the duty of confidentiality, to reveal concerns about a pilot.Random checks might for example detect a drug that the pilot had concealed from his or her employer.Since the disaster Lufthansa and other airlines have ruled that there must always be at least two people in the cockpit.Air accident investigators have staged a test flight to reconstruct conditions on board the Germanwings Airbus A320 which disintegrated on a mountainside in the French Alps after being put into a controlled dive.The German tabloid Bild says experts flew an identical plane, which took off from Hamburg and returned there after flying in German airspace. It took place on 12 May, a spokesman for Germany's crash investigation authority BFU said.French investigators say they hope the reconstruction will help them analyse sounds recorded in the cockpit of Flight 4U 9525.

Mindless,\" he tweeted.In the face of such public anger, it took less than half a day for the government to reverse track and announce it would fund the programme after all.\"We support #HealthyHarold & will work with Life Education Australia to ensure the funding & the program continues,\" tweeted Education Minister Simon Birmingham.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Ballhausen confirmed the government funding would continue.\"Thank you for the extraordinary support we received last night,\" he said. \"It was critical in helping generate this positive response from the Australian Government.\"Although the saga came to a swift resolution, discussion of Harold did not, and more people reminisced on social media.",

Oxford and Cambridge Universities have one, as do Salisbury, Exeter and Durham cathedrals.The historical significance of the Bible was not highlighted in the parish records so it was stored in a cupboard at the back of the church.Mr Baker said: \"It was a really exciting thing to discover - it looks just like something out of Harry Potter.\"One of the wonderful things about worshipping in a church as old as ours is the sense of history that oozes from its walls and discovering the treasures it has to offer.\"But we were stunned to discover a treasure as rare as this. We knew as soon as we saw the date of the New Testament it was a significant find.\"Dr Jeremiah added: \"It's amazing to think we are able to hold a book printed as the direct result of the command of King James 400 years ago.\"\"This English language version of the Bible was created to encourage ordinary people to discover the Good News of Jesus Christ for themselves and it is likely that it was the book that first took God's word into many people's homes in this part of Lancashire.\"Now we hope to encourage the people of Lancashire and elsewhere to visit our church and discover this Bible for themselves.\"",

Unity aimed to be a graphical front-end suitable for lots of different devices.Canonical, which makes the popular Ubuntu distribution of the Linux open source software, started the Unity project in 2011. The ultimate idea was to produce software that ran on large and small devices and could be used the same way on all of them.The Unity project also aimed to let smartphones act as a desktop machine when combined with other devices such as docking stations.However, said Canonical boss Mark Shuttleworth in a blog, although Unity tried to end some of the fragmentation in the open source world it actually ended up contributing to it.In addition, he said, few people had bought phones or laptops that ran the Ubuntu/Unity combination and few laptop makers were offering the software as an option.Mr Shuttleworth said that Ubuntu would switch back to the default user interface for Linux - known as Gnome - in April 2018.He said the decision to end Unity had been \"very difficult\" because he believed strongly in ways to make it easier to use Linux anywhere and everywhere and because of the time he had spent with the developers working on it.\"We feel like a family, but this choice is shaped by commercial constraints and those two are hard to reconcile,\" he said.",

Henrietta Rushwaya, once the federation chief executive, received a life ban for the second time for involvement in the attempted fixing.Rushwaya was banned for life after a previous match-fixing scandal, but that sanction was overturned.

When the schemes are completed, road users will experience safer, more reliable and less congested journeys,\" he added.However transport group, Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said it was concerned about the \"gung-ho way the government is pressing on\" with smart motorways because of concerns over safety and air pollution.Road Campaigner Sian Berry said: \"We know from Highways England's own assessments that the risk of some types of crashes is increased three times by getting rid of the hard shoulder.\"And the government has been ordered by the Supreme Court to write a new air pollution plan that may rule out wider roads altogether.\"",

The school will remain closed on Thursday as a precaution.A small section of the river wall in Croscombe was hammered down by a local resident to drain the water away.Local resident, Peter Baron, said: \"There was about two foot of water on the road and so some citizens turned up with their sledgehammers and bashed the wall down, a big water spout appeared and the road cleared quickly after that.\"Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue said heavy rainfall had also affected parts of Wookey, such as Church Street which was under 2ft (60cm) of water in places earlier.A spokesman for the fire service said crews had attended several properties to pump out water and to clear debris from roads.Earlier heavy rainfall left some roads in Wookey and Shepton Mallet, such as Cannards Grave Road in Shepton under water, but this has now cleared.The head teacher of Bowlish Infants School said it would remain closed on Thursday.",

In fact, I have been informed by Southampton that they are not offering me a new contract.\"However, Reed insists new terms have been offered to the former Benfica player: \"What was offered to Jose was, in my view, quite significant off the back of the contract he signed in October 2015.\"Six months later we were prepared to improve that contract and extend it. He has turned down the opportunity to increase his salary, and he's turned down the opportunity to get another permanent year on his contract.\"",

It looked exactly like the edge of an ice shelf,\" the officer said.Researchers aboard the ship, HMNZS Canterbury, suggest that the source of the pumice was an underwater volcano (seamount) known as Monowai, located to the north of New Zealand.The pumice is likely to have been formed when lava from the seamount came into contact with seawater, and as it is less dense than water it quickly rises to the surface of the ocean.Vicky Hards from the British Geological Survey said the raft of volcanic rocks on this scale was a \"relatively unusual occurrence\".\"Some 50-60 volcanic eruptions are reported per year in total, and out of these only a very small proportion are submarine,\" she told BBC News.\"Nevertheless, submarine volcanic eruptions are a relatively common phenomena, in fact many probably go unrecorded in the deep marine environment.Dr Hards added that a previous example was close to Tristan da Cunha, a small group of small volcanic islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean.\"A small eruption occurred in 2004 and rafts of pumice were observed about a mile offshore, washing up on the beaches for the next weeks\" she explained.",

These books are out of copyright and should be in the public domain,\" he said.\"It should be every child's right everywhere to have these stories as part of their heritage. It's absolutely thrilling.\"The Mabinogion mobile phone application is available to download for free.The Apple website says: \"The Mabinogion is one of the masterpieces of world literature, and a must-read for anyone who wants to have an understanding of Celtic lore.\"",

He said his parents and other relatives were still missing.Heavy rain is thought to have triggered the landslide, causing the top section of a mountain to loosen, sending boulders and rocks crashing down onto the village below at about 06:00 local time on Saturday (22:00 GMT on Friday).Chinese President Xi Jinping later urged the emergency services to \"spare no effort\".More than 3,000 rescuers have been working in the area, using ropes to move large rocks in the frantic search for villagers.But geological experts at the site on Sunday said that the chance of finding survivors was becoming \"really slim\", China's Xinhua news agency reports.The landslide blocked a 2km (1.2-mile) stretch of a river, the news agency added. Local police said a lack of vegetation in the area had made the landslide worse.Local officials said some 8m cubic metres (282m cubic ft) of rock had been dislodged and roads had been closed to all traffic except emergency services.Landslides are a regular danger in mountainous regions of China, especially during heavy rains.In 2008, 87,000 people were killed when an earthquake struck Wenchuan county in Sichuan province. In Maoxian county itself, 37 tourists were killed when their coach was buried in a landslide caused by the 2008 earthquake.",

It also affects a child's mental growth.Apart from food shortage, other factors like poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water also cause malnutrition, leading to stunted growth among children.\"A lack of access to a toilet, clean water and good hygiene practices also play a major role, as repeated bouts of diarrhoea - often caused by dirty water and unhygienic environments - are directly linked to malnutrition,\" the report says.A quarter of all cases of stunting are estimated to be directly caused by chronic diarrhoea in the first two years of life.At least 76 million people live without safe drinking water in India......and 774 million people live without adequate sanitation facilities. Around 140,000 children die every year due to diarrhoea in India.Open defecation is one of the biggest health problems in India.\"India has the highest number of people in the world - more than half a billion - practising open defecation, which spreads deadly diseases and makes children more susceptible to diarrhoea and other infections,\" says Megan Wilson-Jones, WaterAid's policy analyst on health and hygiene.In the past few years, India has made some progress in reducing the number of stunted children. At least 48% of all children were found to be stunted in 2006, but the number has dropped to 39% in 2014, the charity says.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also made it a priority for his government to provide clean drinking water and proper sanitation for all Indians.",

The average price increase for customers whose deals end in July is £274 per year.The biggest hikes are for those on fixed price tariffs with Npower, First Utility (£364) and EDF Energy (£360).Fixed tariffs can protect customers against rising prices, but have cancellation charges if they wish to switch to a different supplier.Energy regulator Ofgem says two-thirds of customers are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically higher than fixed rate tariffs and do not have cancellation charges.Claire Osborne, from uSwitch.com said: \"Switching tariff is incredibly easy and is definitely worth 10 minutes online, on the phone or on an app.\"You can switch without incurring any exit fees 42 days before the contract end date, and comparing and switching takes just minutes to do.\"Ofgem said that last year saw a surge in customers changing energy suppliers, with switching reaching its highest level since 2010, at about 16% of gas and electricity customers.Of these switches, nearly half (47%) were to small or medium suppliers.The uSwitch site is owned by property website Zoopla.

They paid €1,000 as a deposit, but consumed €10,000 ($10,600; £8,600) worth of food and drink.\"There were 160 of them and they all disappeared. Suddenly. Within five minutes,\" Laura told the BBC. \"That was the unusual thing.\"Usually people leave over time, and you expect someone to come to talk to you and say they will settle the bill the next morning or something. But they didn't say anything, they just disappeared.\"The unusual crime has been reported to police, but Ms Arias is in no doubt who is responsible.\"It's the same people. We can tell from the photos.\" Reports in northern Spain quoted witnesses as saying the group was from eastern Europe.On Monday, the Diario del Leon newspaper reported (in Spanish) that two ringleaders had been identified and that police were working to establish firm links between the two cases.",

By 2031 the civil aerospace market will be worth in excess of $4.5 trillion.\"",

That is 11% more than their original offer for the winemaker.Meanwhile an anonymous bidder has, in recent weeks matched that offer.TWE made no mention of the takeover offers in its earnings statement.The winemaker has a turbulent history and is currently undergoing restructuring that will see 175 job cuts.TWE was formed in 1995 as the wine division of Australia's Foster's group, brewers of the eponymous beer.

ITV bought Talpa for £355m earlier this year.But the future of The Voice has become a political hot potato for the corporation as it negotiates with the government over its next royal charter.The Voice was singled out in a consultation paper published by the government ahead of the BBC's charter renewal as a format that is \"similar to ITV's X Factor\", and which was bought in from overseas rather than being developed in-house.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has questioned whether such shows are \"distinctive\" enough from those aired by commercial rivals.In August, the BBC's director of television Danny Cohen defended the corporation's right to air entertainment shows like The Voice.\"I believe that we should keep fighting for entertainment on Saturday nights on the BBC that reaches a wide range of people up and down the country, from all different sorts of backgrounds,\" he said.\"A show like The Voice, it's really popular with young people, diverse audiences and less well-off audiences and it matters to them as much as Strictly, and we should make sure that we offer both,\" said Cohen.Doubts over the show's future mounted after Tuesday's announcement that Cohen is to leave the corporation.",

Before the referendum the IMF had predicted growth of 1.7% for both years.The IMF also revised down its 2018 growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.7%.It said medium-term growth prospects for the 19-member bloc were \"mediocre\" due to high unemployment and debt.Mahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the IMF's European Department, said the outlook could worsen if drawn-out negotiations between the UK and the EU led to a continuation of recent trends in financial markets - where investors have shunned riskier assets.\"If that risk aversion is prolonged, we think the growth impact could be larger and at this point, it is very difficult to tell how long that period lasts,\" he said in a conference call.The revised 2017 figure was the IMF's \"best case\" scenario, assuming a deal was struck that allowed the UK to retain its access to the EU's single market, Mr Pradhan said.However, if the UK decided not to maintain close ties with the EU and chose to rely on World Trade Organization rules, there could be \"major disruptions,\" he said.Mr Pradhan added it was \"very, very early days to have any strong sense of confidence\" about what the eventual relationship between the UK and EU would be.In the medium-term, challenges such as high unemployment and persistent structural weaknesses in the euro area would continue to weigh on growth, the IMF said.\"As a result, growth five years ahead is expected to be about 1.5%, with headline inflation reaching only 1.7%,\" the report said.It also said that as the euro area was such a big player in world trade, any slowdown could have an impact on other economies, including emerging markets, but it expected this to be \"limited\".",

Does lifting either trophy, or simply catching the eye that summer, help propel a player towards Ballon d'Or glory?In World Cup years, 47% of Ballon d'Or winners helped their nation become champions - including England's 1966 hero Sir Bobby Charlton, France's 1998 match-winner Zinedine Zidane and Italy's 2006 victorious captain Fabio Cannavaro.Only 36% helped their nation win the European Championship on the way to earning that year's Ballon d'Or.However, strong performances by an individual at a major international tournament - for example, Czechoslovakia midfielder Josef Masopust at the 1962 World Cup finals, or USSR midfielder Igor Belanov at Mexico 86 - have helped unfancied names earn their place on the gold-covered bauble.England winger Matthews, then aged 41, was the first player to win the prize - but only five other men from the UK have followed in his footsteps.",

If approved, her emoji will be available in 2017.The proposal comes as countries across Europe wrestle with the issue of the Muslim veil - in all its forms.The debate takes in religious freedom, female equality, secular traditions and even fears of terrorism.The veil issue is part of a wider debate about multiculturalism in Europe, as many politicians argue that there needs to be a greater effort to assimilate ethnic and religious minorities.Rayouf Alhumedhi told the BBC it was during a group chat with her friends on social media that she had realised there was no emoji to represent her, a headscarf-wearing woman.After reading an article on emoji design, she wrote an email about her idea to Unicode.Intrigued, a member of a Unicode subcommittee replied, offering to help her draft a formal proposal.\"In this day and age, representation is extremely important,\" she said of her reasons behind the project.\"People want to be acknowledged... and recognised, especially in the tech world. This is massive. Emojis are everywhere.\"There are so many Muslim women in this world who wear the headscarf. It might seem trivial... but it's different when you see yourself on the keyboard around the world. Once you experience that, it's really great.\"To boost support for the initiative, Mr Ohanian hosted a Reddit live online discussion on Tuesday where Reddit users could ask Rayouf Alhumedhi about the new idea.Some wanted to see whether they could get involved while others questioned the need for the hijab, saying it was a tool to oppress women.The drafting committee hopes to present a final version of the proposal to Unicode in November.",

A par does not affect the scoring.Owen, 45, has taken the lead in Reno, Nevada, on the back of two consecutive 14-point rounds as he aims to end a run of 264 events without a victory on the PGA Tour.His closest rivals are American Derek Fathauer and Australian Stuart Appleby but Owen's lead could have been bigger if he had not lost three points with a double bogey on the final hole of his third round.",

Anyone who knew Roy would know who the real man was.\"It took the jury nearly five hours to find Mr Schofield not guilty of the charges.",

A sample of 35 complaints was read out.Prosecutors argued that Geert Wilders crossed a line when he asked supporters if they wanted \"fewer or more Moroccans\" in the Netherlands.After supporters chanted back \"fewer\", he replied: \"We'll organise that.\"Mr Wilders denounced the trial as an attempt to suppress freedom of speech.\"This is a political process, and I refuse to co-operate with it. We have to talk about politics in parliament, not in the courtroom,\" he said in a statement read by his lawyer.But the prosecutor insisted Mr Wilders was wrong to assume that as a politician his remarks were exempt from laws on hate speech.In 2011, Mr Wilders was acquitted of incitement after being accused of encouraging hatred towards Muslims.The latest trial comes as opinion polls suggest the PVV is consistently faring well in polls, ahead of parliamentary elections in March.The party is currently second, behind Prime Minister Mark Rutte's liberal VVD, and is predicted to win 23 seats in the 150-seat parliament.",

Cambridge, London and Brighton were top for cost-effective renting.The survey found that in Glasgow, Coventry and Birmingham renters could pay more than Â£100 a month than those with a mortgage.Renters were most likely to be better off than mortgage payers in pockets of the South, where the supply of homes is tight and house prices are high.Cambridge, London and Brighton are the top places where renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage, the research suggests.In Cambridge, the average monthly rent was found to be about Â£769 less than a mortgage payment.Lawrence Hall, a spokesman for Zoopla, said: \"Once you get past the initial fees that come with a house purchase, such as a deposit and stamp duty, our figures show that it can pay to try and get on the property ladder.\"On top of the enjoyment that can come with owning your property, buyers may also find themselves with more disposable income at the end of the month than those renting their homes.\"Particularly if you're in Scotland, northern England or in the West Midlands, taking the first step on to the ladder and sacrificing the flexibility of renting can be a much cheaper alternative.\"Zoopla's research assumed that someone buying a home had a 10% deposit and was paying a 25-year repayment mortgage with an interest rate of 4.5%.When the data was last analysed by Zoopla in October 2015, buying was cheaper than renting in just over one third of cities.",

The Russian leader is also due to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday.Relations between the US and Russia nosedived after the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014. The move led to the US and other Western countries imposing sanctions on Russia amid allegations that it was fanning the insurgency in east Ukraine by providing troops and arms.Russia has strongly criticised the sanctions, describing them as a naked attempt to force President Putin from power.Russia has also been accused by the US of becoming increasingly involved in the Syria conflict by sending weapons, troops and supplies to an airport near the coastal city of Latakia.US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that the build-up appeared to be limited to Russia protecting its own forces in the country.His comments followed the publication of satellite images that suggested Russia was developing two additional military bases at a weapons depot and military complex north of Latakia.",

Also there will be questions around the transport infrastructure in the area as well.\"I'm always keen for people to think of the local area when it comes to the possibility for more employment... but it's got to be sensitive and in keeping with the area and it has to have a strong level of local support for me.\"Mr Broome took control of Alton Towers in the 1970s, turning it into a major theme park before selling to the Tussauds Group in 1990.",

The reversal comes in response to overwhelming public backlash and the collective outrage expressed by moviegoers across the country.Just days ago, AMC had announced its intention to implement a new policy in select venues, permitting the use of mobile phones during screenings. The move sparked a heated debate among film enthusiasts and industry professionals, who argued that it would severely disrupt the movie-watching experience and detract from the atmosphere.However, it seems the power of public opinion has prevailed. In a press release issued earlier today, AMC's CEO acknowledged the outcry and stated that the company had listened to their customers and decided to rescind the ill-conceived initiative.The about-face decision will undoubtedly come as a relief to the vast majority of movie enthusiasts who value the traditional cinema experience, as well as the sanctity of uninterrupted viewing. The reversal also demonstrates the significance of public sentiment in shaping corporate decisions in the entertainment sector.AMC's original proposal had generated widespread dismay among both regular cinema attendees and industry insiders who saw it as a potential threat to the already beleaguered cinema industry. Critics argued that encouraging phone usage would further drive audiences away from big-screen venues and towards the convenience of home streaming platforms.With the current landscape already strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic, theater chains like AMC have been grappling with declining ticket sales and increased competition from streaming services. The ill-conceived mobile phone policy was seen by many as a misguided attempt to attract younger audiences who are accustomed to constant connectivity.",

The plaintiff, whose identity has not been disclosed, alleges that the rejection violates his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and expression.According to court documents, the individual sought to obtain a license plate that reflects his personal beliefs and conveys a message of his choosing. However, the Kentucky Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) declined the request on the grounds that the requested plate may be deemed offensive or controversial to some members of the public.The plaintiff argues that the denial constitutes a form of discrimination based on religious beliefs, emphasizing that the personalized license plates program already accommodates individuals with messages expressing their faith or belief in God. He further asserts that the plate's intended meaning conveys a personal philosophical notion rather than a literal declaration of divinity.The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the DMV, demanding that they not only issue the requested \"IM GOD\" license plate but also revise their guidelines to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The plaintiff's legal representation maintains that by denying the personalized plate, Kentucky officials have infringed upon their client's constitutional rights.The outcome of this case could have implications for the freedom of expression, as it raises questions about the limits of personalized license plates and the protection of individual beliefs.

The court's decision comes as a stern and definitive response to the grave nature of the crime committed. The mother's actions, undoubtedly driven by extremist ideologies, put her innocent children's lives at serious risk and sought to subject them to a life under the ominous reign of the Islamic State. The court recognized the severity of the situation and the potential long-term consequences for the children's well-being, ultimately deeming a custodial sentence necessary to safeguard their welfare. The case serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by radicalized individuals who attempt to exploit their own family members in the pursuit of dangerous ideologies. It also highlights the crucial need for continued vigilance and preventative measures to counteract the lure of extremist narratives that can have a devastating impact on families and society as a whole. The sentencing sends a clear message that such actions will be met with firm consequences, reflecting the gravity of the offense and the paramount importance of protecting vulnerable individuals, particularly children, from the clutches of extremist ideologies.",

In the end, it was found that the available evidence did not meet the necessary threshold for prosecution. The decision caused the disappointment and frustration of the families of the affected patients, and they demanded their responsibilities to lose their loved ones. The former Stafford Hospital has long been synonymous with the failure of healthcare and systemic problems. When a report in 2009 emphasizes the failure and management failure, and the unnecessary death of countless patients has led to shocking conditions and management failures, the scandal first appeared. Since then, many inquiries have been conducted, investigating and legal lawsuits have been conducted to seek justice for the affected people. Although the conclusion of the pilot review of the police may be frustrated by the family who seeks answers, it highlights the challenge to obtain a personal accountability system in complex cases involving the failure of the agency. This also reminds people of the urgent needs of systemic medical reforms and strict supervision to prevent similar incidents in the future. Going forward must learn from the tragedy of Stafford Hospital, so as to promote the comprehensive reform of the medical care department.",

The country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a higher rate than predicted by experts, thanks to several contributing factors, including robust consumer spending and strong investment activity.During this period, India's GDP grew by a commendable 6.8%, surprising economists who had forecasted a slightly lower growth rate. This positive performance can largely be credited to increased domestic demand, with consumer spending being the driving force behind the economic expansion. Furthermore, the government's emphasis on infrastructure development and policies promoting investment played a crucial role in supporting this growth.The data also revealed encouraging signs for key sectors of the economy, especially manufacturing and construction, which experienced growth spurts and made significant contributions to the overall expansion. However, the sluggish performance of the agricultural sector remained a concern, recording modest growth.As India continues to establish itself as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, this better-than-expected economic performance reinforces the country's potential. It instills a glimmer of hope for policymakers and investors, who are likely to remain optimistic about India's economic prospects.

This innovative method aims to identify the culprits and hold them accountable for their actions. The local council has not dismissed the idea of implementing this unconventional practice, which involves analyzing the genetic material found in dog feces to pinpoint the responsible owner and their pet.The escalating concern about the town's cleanliness has prompted this unique approach, as traditional enforcement and education techniques have proven ineffective in tackling the issue. By resorting to DNA testing, authorities could establish a reliable and indisputable connection between the evidence left behind and the specific dog owner responsible.While critics argue that this method may appear extreme or invasive, proponents assert that it is a necessary step to promote responsible pet ownership and enhance the overall cleanliness of the town. Dog owners, too, have expressed varied reactions, with some embracing the measure as a means to distinguish themselves from negligent owners.If enacted, dog owners within the town may be required to register their pets' DNA, which would then be compared to samples of stray feces discovered on the streets. Matching results would enable the authorities to identify offenders and impose appropriate penalties, such as fines or mandatory attendance at pet responsibility courses.Although the utilization of DNA testing for this purpose is a relatively new concept, similar initiatives have been successfully implemented in other parts of the world, resulting in significant reductions in dog waste pollution.

As he entered the chamber, some Labour MPs were seen to remain seated and silent, while others appeared to only offer muted applause.The lack of enthusiasm from some Labour MPs was in stark contrast to the reception given to May, who received a much warmer welcome from her own party.It is not the first time that Corbyn has been accused of lacking the support of his own MPs. Earlier this year, a number of Labour MPs resigned from his shadow cabinet in protest at his leadership.The latest incident is likely to further damage Corbyn's standing within the Labour Party and will add to the pressure on him to resign.Some commentators have suggested that the Labour MPs who refused to cheer Corbyn may have been motivated by a desire to see him replaced as leader.Others have suggested that the incident was simply a reflection of the deep divisions within the Labour Party over Brexit.Whatever the reason, the lack of support for Corbyn from some of his own MPs is a serious blow to his authority and will make it even more difficult for him to lead the party effectively.It remains to be seen whether Corbyn will be able to weather this latest storm and continue as Labour leader.",

The LGA said the Government had not factored the cost of the new £9.50-an-hour wage into its funding calculations, and that several councils would necessity to ⲅaid other bu dgets or raise council tax in order to plug the funding gap. The LGA is calling on the Government to provide additional funding to help councіls respond the cost of the new wage.

John Smith, a 10-year-old boy from Derry, Northern Ireland, will finally receive a brain scan after a two year wait, his mother Sarah said. Sarah had been concerned about John's ongoing headaches and referred him to their GP for evaluation two years ago. However, due to long wait times in the public health system, John had not received the brain scan the doctor recommended. Frustrated by the delay, Sarah started a social media campaign to raise awareness of John's situation and long wait times for scans locally. Her posts were widely shared in the community. After mounting public pressure, the local health trust contacted Sarah this week to say they could fit John in for the brain scan. While relieved her son will now get answers, Sarah said the two year wait was unacceptable. \"John has been suffering from headaches for so long now with no answers.

Profit margins are being squeezed as costs for items such as labor, transport, and property rise substantially. Meanwhile grocery prices are relatively stable, making it difficult for retailers to pass these extra expenses onto customers. Lewis noted that the supermarket sector saw profits drop eleven percent last year, and he expects this downward trend to continue unless cost pressurescan be addressed. The Tesco boss is calling on the government to help level the playing field by freezing business rates for at least two years. He argued this would allow companies time to adjust to changing market conditions without severe pressure on their bottom lines. Lewis also highlighted the need for retailers to control internal spending tightly and find new efficiencies as they aim to stay competitive in a challenging period. However, he acknowledged that external support is needed if the industry is to overcome its current difficulties.

The vault, located on the Arctic island of Svalbard, is a critical storage facility for seed samples from around the world. Last year, water entered the entrance tunnel of the vault due to melting permafrost and heavier rainfall from climate change. No seed samples were damaged as they are stored in a separate reinforced concrete vault deep inside a mountain. However, officials were concerned this could happen more frequently without upgrades to the defences. They will now line the entrance tunnel with concrete rings and install drainage pumps to keep water out even during heavy rains. The improvements aim to ensure the seed vault can continue preserving crop diversity well into an uncertain future caused by global warming.",

The 31-year-old signed for Shenhua in January 2016 but has struggled to settle in China, scoring only 3 goals in 15 league appearances for the club. Martins' agent Tony Harris says the striker is now looking to move back to Europe, preferably to the Premier League where he has played before for Newcastle United. Harris said Martins misses the competitive nature of the Premier League and feels he still has more to offer at that level. Some Premier League clubs have expressed interest in signing Martins during the summer transfer window according to Harris. Martins' contract with Shanghai Shenhua still has 2 years left but the club may be open to selling the forward if they receive a substantial offer. The striker's time in China has been hampered by injuries and he hopes a return to England could help revive his career. Martins enjoyed success previously in the Premier League with Newcastle United where he scored 35 goals in 3 seasons between 2006-2009. West Ham and West Brom have been linked in the British media with making moves for Martins in the coming weeks. A move backs to England's top flight could provide Martins with the fresh start he needs after a difficult year in China playing in the less competitive Chinese Super League. With the transfer window open until August, Martins and his representatives will be looking to secure a transfer in the next month to resurrect his Premier League career.",

The photo showed Steinbrueck on a boat smiling and holding his hand with his middle finger raised. His opponents have strongly condemned the gesture, calling it unacceptable behavior for a potential leader of Germany. Steinbrueck has since apologized, saying he made the rude sign spontaneously during the tour and did not intend any offense with it. However, members of Merkel's Christian Democrats said the gesture showed Steinbrueck lacked dignity and judgment necessary in a chancellor. Polls show the race between Merkel and Steinbrueck is very close, making any gaffes that could undermine Steinbrueck's image costly for the Social Democrats. Steinbrueck's party has struggled to gain traction in their campaign to defeat Merkel, who remains very popular. The rude photo threatens to damage Steinbrueck's chances in the upcoming election and give Merkel's party more ammunition against their rival.

Finney continued to volunteer as head coach for 25 years, helping to nurture the swimming talents of generations of Redditch residents.

Spanning three days and nights, volunteers from the London theatre community worked in shifts to bring the ancient saga to life for audiences. \"It was an immense challenge but also such a privilege to be able to introduce people living in modern London to this fascinating work that is so crucial to Indian culture and history,\" remarked Julie Carpenter, one of the lead organizers, who started afternoon on Saturday and finished her part in the wee hours of Monday morning.As performers took turns spreading the massive work out over the extended period, attendees were free to come and go as they pleased, immersed in the unfolding tale for even just a short stretch or staying for an entire shift. The ambitious event attracted an eclectic bunch of both South Asian diaspora seeking a connection to their heritage as well as curious Londoners wanting a glimpse into classic world literature.  During their time on weekends are usually reserved for more leisurely pursuits, many said they were glad for the opportunity to experience such an important cultural marathon right in the heart of the city. \"It was so insightful to learn about the roots of Hindu epics while also being in awe of the commitment of the performers,\" remarked Adam Smith, a visitor who popped in for a few hours on Sunday afternoon.",

According to a survey conducted by the BBC, Idoc Management Services, a Leeds-based company, was hired last year to consolidate patient records as several clinics and GP surgeries in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex were consolidating or relocating to new facilities. However, consultants managing the massive transfer project said they have been struggling with staffing shortages and significant performance issues from the contractor. Multiple residents in the affected areas have contacted their local officials to voice concerns over not being able to access their full medical records for appointments. \"I had tests done last month and when I went to my follow up, nothing was on file. It's worrying not knowing if something was missed,\" said Jason Evans, a 42-year-old father of two from Lowestoft. Local GPs said the issue is complicating care as critical information like test results and prior diagnoses are not always available during consultations. A whistleblower who witnessed the file transfer process said the company appeared to be in over their heads with the size and complexity of taking on medical records for over 300,000 patients across three counties. They said storage areas were disorganized and tracking systems were insufficient. Idoc Management Services was fined last year following a performance review that uncovered recruitment problems and gaps in properly supervising temporary staff brought on to assist with the workload. Health leaders in Norfolk and Suffolk pledged to investigate how so many records went astray on their watch.",

Solo, who has built a reputation as one of the world's best goalkeepers, could not stop any of Sweden's penalties as they converted all four attempts. Meanwhile, two US penalties were saved as Sweden advanced to the semifinals with a 4-3 shootout victory. It was heartbreak for Solo and the American team, who are now unable to win gold on home soil. Solo's harsh criticisms of Sweden may now result in disciplinary action for her statements.",

Council planners warn locating a massive retail site outside of the city center might \"adversely impact\" the center by drawing customers and foot traffic away from core businesses. The development would include big box stores and a shopping complex intended to generate more revenue for the costly stadium upgrade. However, council planning committee members note placing big retailers near the stadium risks undermining the vitality of the high street, which is critical to the local economy.

The MoJ claims that this is necessary in case of unexpected events that might require the prison's reactivation. However, the council argues that this decision is a setback for the town's cultural and economic development. The prison, which was shut down in 2013, has been the subject of controversy over its future, with some calling for it to be turned into an arts venue or a cultural destination. Despite this, the MoJ has insisted that its primary focus is on ensuring that the prison remains ready for use if needed.",

Despite the repeated appearances, not a single viewer or colleague commented on his attire, leading him to suspect that no one was paying attention.The presenter's sartorial stunt was not intentional but rather the result of a wardrobe malfunction. He had planned to wear a different suit for a special segment but realized too late that it was still at the dry cleaner's. In a pinch, he opted for the trusty blue suit, which he deemed 'presentable enough.'To his surprise, the blue suit became a de facto uniform of sorts, with viewers apparently too engrossed in the news to notice.

She recalled an incident where her teammates refused to stay in the same hotel room as her, citing her heterosexuality as the reason.The bullying, according to Wiggins, was not limited to her teammates. She alleged that her coaches also participated in the harassment, making derogatory comments about her sexual orientation and spreading rumors about her personal life.Wiggins stated that the bullying had a significant impact on her mental health, causing her to struggle with depression and anxiety. She eventually decided to retire from professional basketball in 2016, citing the emotional toll the bullying had taken on her.The former basketball star expressed disappointment that the sport she loved had become a source of pain and isolation for her. She hopes that by sharing her story, she can help create a more inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ athletes in the future.Wiggins' allegations have sparked a national conversation about homophobia in women's sports.
