For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magneticproperties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits twokinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a largemanifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effectsself-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of theoriginal SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to thedependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameterkappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numericalcalculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phasediagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and adecoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. Wecorroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the variousphases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determinedby analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spinperturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 modelleads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, theground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.",

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of theouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting inaccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifestitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present asearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopicbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find thatthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. Thebrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overallperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more thanhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not asclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic componentis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement withpredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar tothose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur fromcircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending thetimescale over which they might form planets.",

However theapplication of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for anextended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contraryto popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within thecontext of Quantum Theory.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weaklyinteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBHcan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due toannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or evenexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thuspredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinityof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burnersare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degeneratecores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for theexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish itsdensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMPburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate coremasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with theobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could beconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. Wealso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux ofgamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the darkmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that theEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precisionmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matterspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringentlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.",

A systematic, multiphysics basedmodelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model fordegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed todecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of theCNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain theself-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical forceare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current atthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation andintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. Thesimulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results.

In both cases the response of the lithosphere to externalforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. Onone-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays animportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing thedeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under theassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravityand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of thelithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governingthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variableYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, exceptfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are thetransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to includebottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stressfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We furthershow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thicknessvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that thedegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidaltangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shelland are associated with translational and rotational freedom.

While it is now clear thatthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning starswithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their originhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost theirenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarfpopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary populationsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on thebinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hotsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproducesmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range ofobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolutionwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostictools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications forunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies ingeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, ashad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be stronglydependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally fromdwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.",

Evidence for this has been found formany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted testfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, allone-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the samedistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correctionterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging fromexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, anddepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of theexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacingsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fouriercoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expectto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (forexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of ellipticcurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower orderbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rankover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze severalfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forcedtorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).",

We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phasetransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of thephase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyondthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, thespace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states andconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealedone. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominantstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes isallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, abovethe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all thecritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determinetheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.

The sequence of eclipse maps of the2000 July outburst reveal that the disk shrinks at outburst onset while anuneclipsed component of 13 per cent of the total light develops. The derivedradial intensity distributions suggest the presence of an outward-movingheating wave during rise and of an inward-moving cooling wave during decline.The inferred speed of the outward-moving heating wave is ~ 1.6 km/s, while thespeed of the cooling wave is a fraction of that. A comparison of the measuredcooling wave velocity on consecutive nights indicates that the cooling waveaccelerates as it travels towards disk center, in contradiction with theprediction of the disk instability model. From the inferred speed of theheating wave we derive a viscosity parameter alpha_{hot} ~ 0.13, comparable tothe measured viscosity parameter in quiescence.

Due to this property, Einstein clusters may be considered as darkmatter candidates. We analyse the stability of the Einstein clusters againstboth radial and non-radial pulsations, and we show that the Einstein clustersare dynamically stable. With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities foranisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particlesdefining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained fromstability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that thegravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, ascompared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter.Therefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, betweenEinstein cluster and other dark matter models.",

First, we characterize thestability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the samecondition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distributionoptimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding thethresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPCensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. Moreprecisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap tocapacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (thegap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).  We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MSalgorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant$1/\\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity waslesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for ratesbetween 0.3 and 0.9.

Laser is an opensystem; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, onerelated to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. Thebasic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions towhich are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Evenin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up anddown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before thepopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of theEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevellasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity forthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of thelasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upperand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevellaser system.

Our findings are that:  (i) Galaxies in close pairs are generally more asymmetric than isolatedgalaxies and the degree of asymmetry increases for closer pairs. At least 35%of close pairs (with projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc andvelocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1}) show significant asymmetry andare therefore likely to be physically bound.  (ii) Among asymmetric galaxies, we find that at least 80% are eitherinteracting systems or merger remnants. However, a significant fraction ofgalaxies initially identified as asymmetric are contaminated by nearby stars orare fragmented by the source extraction algorithm. Merger rates calculated viaasymmetry indices need careful attention in order to remove the above sourcesof contamination, but are very reliable once this is carried out.  (iii) Close pairs and asymmetries represent two complementary methods ofmeasuring the merger rate. Galaxies in close pairs identify future mergers,occurring within the dynamical friction timescale, while asymmetries aresensitive to the immediate pre-merger phase and identify remnants.  (iv) The merger fraction derived via the close pair fraction and asymmetriesis about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}.These results are marginally consistent with theoretical simulations (dependingon the merger time-scale), but imply a flat evolution of the merger rate withredshift up to z ~1.",

A torus with the ratio between its twogenerated radii larger than $\\sqrt{2}$ is predicted from the Euler-Lagrangeequations. It is found that tubules with helically modulated tilting state arenot admitted by the Euler-Lagrange equations, and that they are lessenergetically favorable than helical ripples in tubules. The pitch angles ofhelical ripples are theoretically estimated to be about 0$^\\circ$ and35$^\\circ$, which are close to the most frequent values 5$^\\circ$ and28$^\\circ$ observed in the experiment [N. Mahajan \\textit{et al.}, Langmuir\\textbf{22}, 1973 (2006)]. Additionally, the present theory can explain twistedribbons of achiral cationic amphiphiles interacting with chiral tartratecounterions.

The supernovaejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter densecircumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star. The resulting shock hassubsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which isresolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expandinglimb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radioremnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600km/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters ofthe evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radiovalues, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray dataeliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell inboth wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution isseen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims havehigher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most ofthe radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where theprogenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobeis brighter than and further from the supernova site than the western lobe,suggesting an additional asymmetry in the initial distribution of supernovaejecta.",

Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationallyexpensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), hasgreatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and alsoproduces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been appliedsuccessfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but theirimplementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounceddegeneracies.

Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can imposestrong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model.However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challengingdue to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identificationwith the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection ofbremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced.Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 withrespect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that thebremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positronmomenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of theexperiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positronoverabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positronproduction. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of apositron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.  The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments arecombined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positronfraction data yet available.",

The gravitational field of the system isdominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modifiedby the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (anaxially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozaioscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chancethat stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Suchevents can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretionactivity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidaldisruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. Bynumerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss conewe determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativisticadvance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlargingthe loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted starsshould grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the clustermean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act againstthe eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption eventsto be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model inwhich the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentreadvance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored.

Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity ofstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are opticallythin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empiricalmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can beoptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account forclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumpsreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergentspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that theoptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PVresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken intoaccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line andrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumpingmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha linein O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of opticallythick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimatingempirical mass-loss rates.",

Incontrast, CeOsPO shows antiferromagnetic order at TN=4.4K despite only minorchanges in lattice parameters and electronic configuration. Additional 31P NMRresults support these scenarios. LSDA+U calculations evidence a quasi twodimensional electronic band structure, reflecting a strong covalent bondingwithin the CeO and RuP layers and a weak ionic like bonding between the layers.",

We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, asa by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformlydescribed in a rime form.  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezoutoperators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associativeclassical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. Anormal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminantof a certain quadratic polynomial. We also classify orderable quadratic rimeassociative algebras.  For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution, there is a choice of themultiparameters, for which it can be non-trivially rimed. However, not everyBelavin-Drinfeld triple admits a choice of the multiparameters for which it canbe rimed. We give a minimal example.",

In particular, we show that it is NP-hard toapproximate within an inverse polynomial the value of a one-round game with (i)quantum verifier and two entangled provers or (ii) classical verifier and threeentangled provers. Previously it was not even known if computing the valueexactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true,would imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.  We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-provergames to make them resistant to entangled provers. We then show that a strategyfor the modified game that uses entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one thatdoes not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds. Ourwork implies that, unless P=NP, the values of entangled-prover games cannot becomputed by semidefinite programs that are polynomial in the size of theverifier's system, a method that has been successful for more restrictedquantum games.",

The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneousCrump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetimedistribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, thatis, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point processalong the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. Asplitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of achronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of someindividual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative realnumber called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order onexistence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\\varphi$ from the treeinto the real line which preserves this order. The inverse of $\\varphi$ iscalled the exploration process, and the projection of this inverse onchronological levels the contour process.

It turns out that thestructural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differsignificantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainlyattributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that thelargest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for theorientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueoussolution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number ofwater molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, thehydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger forL-alanine in water as compared to crystal.

However, due to lowspectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potentialfor use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use ofmultiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmissionprotocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain aredeveloped. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocolswith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one sourceuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits thatthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. Inaddition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which networkcoding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can beobtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposedprotocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, andlower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperativetransmission protocols.",

The cost of games - especially computer games - toys and hobbies shot up by 2.7%.Prices are also on the rise for clothing, up 0.6% compared with a fall of 0.3% a year ago, with children's clothing seeing the biggest increase.The ONS also reported higher prices for furniture and household goods.Shoppers have been used to falling prices in the supermarket aisles in recent years but this trend is now at an end.Sugar, jams, chocolate, syrups and confectionary all contributed to the latest rise in this category.With inflation now at its highest rate in nearly four years, the impact of past falls in sterling continue to feed through to households, according to Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics: \"Food inflation rose by 2.5% according to the latest data, the fastest since 2013. Given the least affluent households spend around 17% of their expenditure on food and drink, rising prices will have a significant impact on their discretionary spending power going forward.\"What's more, real earnings are already shrinking. With inflation expected to accelerate further in the coming months, the backdrop for retailers looks set to become even more challenging.\"Electricity bills jumped by 4% and gas bills were also slightly up, reflecting price hikes from some of the big six energy suppliers.But travel costs were down. Air fares usually go down after Easter, one of the peak holiday periods. Because Easter came later this year, air fares fell back in May, which was a big contributor to the downward effect.And the prices at the pump also dropped between April and May this year, bringing some relief, at least, to consumers.",

The X-ray variability is found to be correlated with the radio flux density, suggesting a connection between the X-ray and radio emitting regions. The broad iron line is interpreted as arising from the inner accretion disk, while the blueshifted Fe XXVI line is likely produced by a jet outflow.

They are mainly composed of protons, alpha particles, and heavier nuclei. Cosmic rays can interact with the interstellar medium, which is composed of gas and dust, and can be scattered or absorbed. The propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy is a complex process that is affected by a number of factors, including the energy of the cosmic rays, the density of the interstellar medium, and the magnetic field of the Galaxy.In this paper, we present a numerical model for the propagation of high energy cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Our model takes into account the effects of scattering and absorption of cosmic rays by the interstellar medium, as well as the effects of the magnetic field of the Galaxy. We use our model to calculate the flux of cosmic rays at Earth as a function of energy. We compare our results with experimental data and find that our model is able to reproduce the observed flux of cosmic rays.Our model can be used to study the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy and to understand the origin and evolution of cosmic rays. It can also be used to calculate the flux of cosmic rays at Earth for a variety of applications, such as the design of spacecraft and the study of the effects of cosmic rays on the environment.",

Using a Bayesian approach, we construct a parametrized form for the metric and compute its posterior probability distribution given current cosmological data sets. Our analysis uses supernova luminosity distances, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background to constrain the metric. The results provide the first model-independent reconstruction of the spacetime geometry on cosmological scales from observations. Key features of the derived metric agree with the concordance Lambda CDM model while remaining flexible enough to identify possible deviations.

Marginal structural models (MSMs) provide a powerful framework for causal inference in the presence of time-varying confounding. However, traditional MSMs require the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, which may be violated in practice. History-restricted marginal structural models (HRMSMs) are a recently developed extension of MSMs that relaxes the assumption of no unmeasured confounding by restricting the confounding paths to be constant over time. HRMSMs offer a more robust approach to causal inference in longitudinal studies when unmeasured confounding is suspected. In this paper, we provide an introduction to HRMSMs, including the identification assumptions, estimation methods, and inferential procedures.

The scheme is based on the Eulerian Conservative High Order (ECHO) approach, which combines the advantages of conservative and high-order methods. ECHO is able to accurately capture the dynamics of both matter and magnetic fields in a variational framework, ensuring energy and momentum conservation at all times. The scheme is well-suited for simulations of complex astrophysical phenomena, such as black hole accretion, neutron star mergers, and cosmological large-scale structure formation. ECHO's ability to handle complex geometries and nonlinear effects makes it a valuable tool for studying a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. The scheme's conservative properties ensure that the solution remains physically meaningful, even in the presence of strong gravitational and magnetic fields. ECHO's high-order accuracy allows for efficient simulations with high spatial and temporal resolution, enabling the exploration of previously inaccessible astrophysical regime.

Vacuum energy, also known as zero-point energy, is the lowest energy state of a quantum mechanical system. It has been a subject of extensive research in physics due to its fundamental role in understanding the properties of the vacuum and its potential effects on the universe. Renormalization theory, on the other hand, provides a framework to handle divergences that arise in quantum field theories.In this study, we investigate the interplay between vacuum energy and renormalization in the context of systems confined to the edge. We focus on the distinctive properties exhibited by edge states and how they influence the renormalization process. By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we analyze the behavior of vacuum energy in edge systems and determine its renormalized values.Our findings reveal that the presence of edges significantly impacts the renormalization of vacuum energy. We observe new types of divergences and regularization techniques specific to edge effects. Additionally, we identify novel phenomena arising from the interplay between vacuum energy and edge states, such as edge-induced renormalization anomalies.These results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the renormalization theory but also have implications for diverse areas of research, including condensed matter physics, topological insulators, and quantum information processing.

We analyze a decade-long dataset of X-ray observations obtained from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and employ advanced timing techniques to probe the temporal properties of the emission. Our analysis reveals the presence of distinct X-ray variability patterns in NGC 3783, indicating different accretion states. We identify two dominant variability components: fast variations on timescales of hours to days and slower, long-term fluctuations occurring over months to years. The fast variations exhibit a power-law power spectral density, characteristic of a fluctuating hot corona above the accretion disk. Under the assumption that the fast variations arise from the innermost region, we infer that the accretion state of NGC 3783 is consistent with the soft state. This is supported by the presence of a high-frequency break in the power spectrum, indicative of a truncated disk. Additionally, the long-term fluctuations suggest intermittent transitions between different accretion states.Our findings provide valuable insights into the accretion processes governing the behavior of Seyfert galaxies.

By virtue of a specially designed ansatz, we are able to obtain an explicit expression for the partition function of the chain, which in turn allows us to study various statistical properties of the spectrum. Our results show that the level density of the chain follows a Gaussian distribution with remarkable accuracy, and the distribution of normalized spacings between consecutive levels is found to be qualitatively similar to that of other spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spacings distribution is not Poissonian, providing further evidence that spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type are exceptional integrable models. By means of a simple analytic approximation, we are able to accurately describe the cumulative spacings distribution of the chain, which is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical data. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the rich phenomenology of spin chains and provide new insights into the peculiar properties of integrable systems.",

We focus on a class of instantons that couple to both the MSSM fields and the right-handed neutrinos in the CFT sector.Through a careful analysis of the instanton contributions to the effective action, we find that the Majorana mass terms for neutrinos can be generated via these non-perturbative effects. The specific structure of the instanton amplitudes, involving both observable and hidden sector fields, plays a crucial role in determining the resulting neutrino mass matrix. We study different choices for the instanton amplitudes and explore their consequences on the neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing angles.Remarkably, we find that certain combinations of instanton amplitudes lead to phenomenologically viable neutrino mass patterns, consistent with experimental data. In particular, we observe the emergence of approximate tri-bimaximal mixing patterns, which are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation measurements. Additionally, we investigate the impact of additional compactification details, such as the presence of fluxes and the geometry of the extra dimensions, on the resulting neutrino masses and mixings.Our analysis sheds light on the possible origin of neutrino masses within the framework of CFT orientifolds with MSSM-like spectra.

In this article, we present a novel string-derived Z' model that addresses these issues. The Z' gauge boson arises from string compactifications in the presence of an additional U(1)' gauge symmetry, which is broken at an intermediate scale. This new U(1)' gauge symmetry allows for renormalizable interactions that violate R-parity, providing a potential solution to the mu-problem and the proton decay problem.We demonstrate that the presence of light neutrinos can be achieved through the seesaw mechanism, where the Z' plays a crucial role in the generation of neutrino masses. Moreover, the discrete gauge symmetries arising from the string compactification ensure the stability of the proton, as they impose constraints on the charge assignments of the exotic fields. The interplay between the U(1)' gauge symmetry, the seesaw mechanism, and the discrete gauge symmetries leads to a consistent framework where the proton remains stable.We analyze the model's phenomenological implications and identify several scenarios that satisfy experimental constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the collider phenomenology associated with R-parity violation within this framework, providing potential avenues for experimental verification.

Utilizing deep photometric data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we examine the color distribution of the GCSs in a sample of five massive ellipticals. Our findings reveal significant multimodality in the GCSs, manifested by distinct color peaks observed at various radial distances. By comparing the GCS colors with stellar population synthesis models, we infer that the multiple peaks arise from the presence of different age and metallicity subpopulations within the GCSs. Our results support the scenario of a two-phase formation process for GCSs, involving an initial rapid formation phase followed by an extended period of slower assembly. Furthermore, we find a radial dependence in the relative contributions of different GCS subpopulations, with younger and more metal-rich clusters dominating in the central regions, while older and more metal-poor clusters become more prevalent in the outskirts. These radial variations provide valuable insights into the assembly history of massive ellipticals and suggest the importance of both in-situ and accretion-driven formation mechanisms in shaping GCS properties. Overall, our study highlights the significance of radial profiling of GCSs in understanding the complex interplay between stellar populations and galaxy formation processes in massive ellipticals.",

Our results show that the B-band attenuation of bulge light is significantly higher than that of disc light, indicating that bulges are more heavily obscured by dust. We find that the dust content of galaxies increases with increasing galaxy mass, and that the most massive galaxies have the highest dust-to-stellar mass ratios.

Understanding the behavior of momentum is crucial for describing the dynamics of particles. However, the reality of momentum expectation values has been a subject of debate concerning bound states. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, this research explores the underlying principles governing the measurement and interpretation of momentum in confined systems.Our findings reveal that in bound states, the expectation value of linear momentum exhibits oscillatory behavior around zero, indicating the nonlocal nature of momentum in confined systems. This outcome challenges the intuitive notion of a particle possessing a definite momentum within a bound state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expectation value of angular momentum in bound states displays quantized behavior, consistent with theoretical predictions of angular momentum quantization.Moreover, we analyze the influence of factors such as potential shape and boundary conditions on the manifestations of momentum in bound systems. We observe that changes in these parameters can significantly impact the behavior of momentum expectation values, highlighting the system's sensitivity to external constraints.This study contributes to ongoing discussions concerning the reality and interpretation of momentum in quantum mechanics. The presented results deepen our understanding of momentum behavior in bound states and provide valuable insights for the development of future theoretical frameworks and experimental designs. Ultimately, this research serves as a foundation for further investigations into the nature of momentum and its implications in confined quantum systems.",

Giant LSB galaxies are characterized by their extensive size and exceedingly low surface brightness, rendering them arduous to examine using optical wavelengths. Consequently, infrared observations serve as indispensable tools for probing their physical properties and unraveling their formation mechanisms. By leveraging data from infrared surveys, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory, a comprehensive analysis of the infrared emission from a sample of giant LSB galaxies is conducted.The analysis reveals distinctive infrared properties exhibited by giant LSB galaxies in comparison to their high surface brightness counterparts. Despite their diminished flux levels, these galaxies predominantly exhibit infrared emission in the mid-infrared range, implying the presence of warm dust heated by ongoing star formation activities. Moreover, the infrared colors of giant LSB galaxies deviate from those of normal galaxies, suggesting unique dust properties and/or different stellar populations.Furthermore, this study delves into the correlation between the infrared properties and other fundamental characteristics of giant LSB galaxies, including their size, stellar mass, and metallicity. The results indicate a correlation between infrared luminosity and these parameters, with larger and more massive galaxies exhibiting heightened infrared emission.

The Abell 901/902 supercluster presents an advantageous setting for exploring the influence of large-scale structures on galaxy properties due to its abundant cluster environment and high galaxy density. A visual morphological classification scheme is employed to categorize galaxies into four primary morphological types: ellipticals, spirals, irregulars, and mergers. Subsequently, we analyze the morphological classifications in relation to the local galaxy density and proximity to massive clusters.Our findings disclose discernible trends in galaxy morphologies across diverse environments. Elliptical galaxies dominate the central regions of massive clusters, while spiral galaxies are mainly concentrated in lower density regions. Irregular galaxies exhibit a more dispersed distribution, implying that they are less affected by their immediate environment. Merging galaxies are primarily detected in close proximity to dense regions, indicating that interactions and mergers are more prevalent in such environments.Moreover, we conduct a quantitative analysis to measure the environmental effects on galaxy morphologies. We observe a strong correlation between local galaxy density and the fraction of elliptical galaxies, indicating that galaxy interactions and dynamical processes significantly contribute to the formation and evolution of ellipticals.

We calculate the iron line profiles by taking into account the effects of reⅼativistic effects, such as gravita𝚝ional redshift and light bending, and self-shadowing effects, which are caused by the fact that the inenr part of the disc is obscured by the outеr part of the disc. We find that the iron line profiles are significantly affected by the relativіstic effects and self-shadowing effects. The relativistic effects make the iron line profiles wide and weaker, while the self-shadowing effects make the iron line proiles shallower and narrower. We also find that the iron line profiles are sensitive to the black hole spin and the disc thick. Our results can be used to cons𝚝rain the black hоle spin and the disc thickness of the relativistic thick accretion discs.",

        "text": "The researches presented in this section concentrating on advancing our understanding of the boundary conditions of the heliosphere, with a specific emphasis on developing photoionization models that are constrained by both interstellar and in situ data. The heliosphere is the region in spacecraft dominated by the Sun's influence and acts as a protective shieⅼd against galactic cosmic rays and interstellar medium. Accurate characterization of the heliospheric boudary conditions is crucial for studying various astrophysical phenomena and for predictiոg the effects of solar activity on space weather. To achieѵe this, the authors employ a comprehensive approach that combines observational data from interstellar neutral atoms and in situ meaѕurements of solar wind plasma and energetic particles. They using these data to construct and refine photoionization models that siｍulate the ionization processes occurring at the heliospheric interface. The interstellar neutral atoms are detected and studied by several space mіssions, such as Voyager and Interstellar Boundary Explore (IBEX), while the in si𝚝u measurements are obtained from spacecraft like the Advanced Composition Explores (ACE) and Parker Solar Probe (PSP). By comparing the predictions of the photoionization models with the available detail, the authors are able to evaluated the accuracy and reliability of these models. The results reveal important insights into the phyical processes governing the heliospheric boundary, shedding light on ionization rates, chaⲅge exchnage processes, and the distribution of neutral and ionized particles at the heliospheric interface. Such knowledge contriЬutes to a better understanding of the global sturcture and dynamics of the heliosphere and its interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium. Additionally, the article discusses the implications of the refined photoionization models for interprеting and analyzing future observational data.",

However, the Kentucky Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) declined the request on the grounds that the requested plate may be deemed offensive or controversial to some members of the public.The plaintiff argues that the denial constitutes a form of discrimination based on religious beliefs, emphasizing that the personalized license plates program already accommodates individuals with messages expressing their faith or belief in God. He further asserts that the plate's intended meaning conveys a personal philosophical notion rather than a literal declaration of divinity.The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the DMV, demanding that they not only issue the requested \"IM GOD\" license plate but also revise their guidelines to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

The vaccination program, which started in 2013, aimed to curb the transmission of TB from badgers to cattle. However, the chief vet has stated that it is still unclear whether the vaccination efforts have led to a significant reduction in TB cases among livestock. This revelation raises concerns about the long-term efficacy of the program and its impact on the ongoing battle against bovine TB.Bovine TB poses a significant threat to the farming industry in Wales, with thousands of cattle being slaughtered each year due to the disease. Vaccinating badgers was seen as a potential solution to mitigate the risk of transmission, as badgers have been identified as one of the primary sources of the infection. However, the lack of concrete evidence to support the effectiveness of the vaccination program raises questions about its viability as a long-term solution.Farmers and agricultural organizations have called for decisive action from the Welsh Government to address the TB crisis. They argue that the high number of cattle slaughtered and the increasing prevalence of the disease in certain areas, such as Pembrokeshire, are severely impacting the industry's sustainability. Many believe that a more comprehensive approach, including targeted measures to combat the disease in both wildlife and cattle populations, is needed to eradicate bovine TB in Wales.In response to the concerns raised, the Welsh Government has stated that it will continue to address all sources of infection in the most appropriate manner. The government spokesperson acknowledged the need for a refreshed TB program and emphasized the importance of considering wildlife issues alongside new cattle and biosecurity measures.",

This decline represents a significant improvement compared to when records were first kept in 1993, when an average of 7.2 days were lost per worker.

We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear regionof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images showno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to theradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separatefeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The westernfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocitycorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggestingthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. Furthermore, we identify abundant species such as CO, HCN, and HCO+ in the jet-disturbed region, and tested their lineup ratios to study the molecular gas excitation and chemistry. The distribution of molecular gas correlates well with the radio gamut emission, supporting the interpretation of the encountered structures as AGN-driven shocks. Thisvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for theputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed moleculargas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by thejet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.",

In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be aclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenicneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, andfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as longas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. Onthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalacticprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$eV. Vy comparing the expected flux to existing and future neutrino detector observations, we assess the signatures of the transition from Galactic to extragalatcic cosmic rays. Our naalysis combines knowledge of the Galactic cosmic ray flux, the interstellar medium, and particle interactions, to accurately simulate the expected eutrino flux. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us informationon the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expectedsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection ofcosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.",

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weaklyinteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBHcan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due toannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or evenexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thuspredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinityof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burnersare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. Our findings suggest the presence of potential dark matter burners within the Galactic center, providing compelling evidence for the interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter on a local scale.Furthermore, we explored the implications of these dark matter burners in the broader context of understanding the nature of dark matter. Our investigation focused on pinpointing anomalies that deviated from expected astrophysical processes alone, which could be attributed to the interaction and annihilation of dark matter particles.Through rigorous statistical analysis and cross-referencing multiple data sets, we detected anomalous signatures that align with dark matter burning scenarios. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMPburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate coremasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with theobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could beconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. Wealso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux ofgamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the darkmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. These signatures exhibit characteristic patterns and intensity distributions that differ significantly from known astrophysical sources.

Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. Interestingly, we identify a critical interaction range beyond which cooperation diminishes, emphasizing the delicate balance between local interactions and global population dynamics.To further understand the evolutionary dynamics, we analyze the impact of mutation rates, different game payoffs, and population sizes on the prevalence of cooperative strategies. In this article, we explore the implications of such population structures on the evolution of cooperative and competitive strategies.Minimally structured populations involve a simple form of local interactions, where individuals only interact with their immediate neighbors.

We observe that very quickly the modeamplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations isreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo acyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward afull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitationalradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very longtimescale of about $10^6$ years.

We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shapeof early-type galaxies.",

These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the generation and propagation of Poynting jets in the vicinity of rotating black holes and contribute to our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Any large scale poloidal magnetic fluxthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release ofelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic fluxthreading the event horizon.

Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach withfirst-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the lineardensity and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with ouralgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders ofmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, wherethe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-findingand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations withradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the sizedistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. This enables us to study the brightness temperature evolution and its statistical properties, such as the 21 cm signal, which is crucial for understanding the reionization and pre-reionization epochs.Our approach allows for simulations with large volume box sizes, on the order of 1000 Mpc, while maintaining reasonable computational times. This enables us to obtain a significant number of realizations, which in turn allows for exploring different assumptions regarding astrophysics and background cosmology governing the 21 cm signal. We find that velocities widen the tailsof the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though theseeffects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include somepreliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range todate: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. Weshow that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires suchlarge scales.

Thedynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shellequations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetarinflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. Thebubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidalmagnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsarwind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct valueof E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion ofmagnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; weargue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely tobe significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. The outflow Lorentz factor surged with the strength of the magnetar magnetic terrestrial, while it decreases with increasing rotation phases of the magnetar and with increasing density of the stellar envelope. Results:Our dramatization show that magnetar-driven bubbles can indeed product collimated outflows with Lorentz factors of a few tens to hundreds. This canaccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasinglymagnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-drivenmass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that themagnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing theenergy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomesprogressively more collimated, producing the GRB.",

Aims.In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples ofblazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statisticalproperties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-likeproperties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopicallyidentify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method.

Our catalog includes 173 new blazaridentifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars. The relativelyhigh flux threshold in the X-ray energy band (given by the RASS survey)preferentially selects objects with high fx / fr ratio leading to the discoveryof new High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBLs).

Cepheids in the inner region of NGC4258 with near solarmetallicities (Macri et al.) confirm this result. We obtain a zero-point forthe reddening-free relation and apply it to Cepheids in galaxies used bySandage et al. to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of SNIa and to derive theHubble constant. While the Hipparcos satellite offered limited Cepheid parallaxes, the ongoing Gaia satellite is anticipated to provide more precise measurements for numerous Cepheids, enabling a more accurate Hubble constant determination. The implications of this measurement for the extragalactic distance scale and the age of the universe are discussed. 2001 value is revised from 72 to 76+/-8 km/s/Mpc. These resultsare insensitive to Cepheid metallicity corrections. The Cepheids in the innerregion of NGC4258 yield a modulus of 29.22+/-0.03(int) compared with amaser-based modulus of 29.29+/-0.15.

OO Ser was monitored with theInfrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering20 months.

Weanalysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructedlight curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energydistributions. The mass of the envelope ejected during the outburst is estimated to be 3 × 10−3 M⊙. The forbidden lines of [N ii] and [S ii] also appeared during the outburst. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading ratesindicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. Theoutburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longerthan that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggestthat OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities tothe recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. The Hα emission-line equivalent width increased by a factor of 12 from 1995 to 2001. The object is probably surrounded by anaccretion disc and a dense envelope.

Increasing di sparity in aspect ratios between the two particle shapes strengthened the orientational ordering and lowered the critical packing fraction needed for demixing. Our findings provide insight into self-assembly of aniso tropic colloids and may inform design of novel composite materials. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The first plane is definedby the directions toward which local CMB features are anomalously aligned. Amean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to theecliptic poles axis. The second plane is defined by the directions anomalouslyavoided by local CMB features. This alignment anomaly provides further insighton recent results (Wiaux et al. 2006). Deviations from expected values are assessed with Gaussian simulations of the concordance cosmology. More data will help to better constrain potential explanations for these anomalous features in the large-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background. In bothanalyses, the anomalies are observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angularsizes around 10 degress on the celestial sphere, with global significancelevels around 1%. Further investigation reveals that the alignment andsigned-intensity anomalies are only very partially related. Instrumental noise,foreground emissions, as well as some form of other systematics, are stronglyrejected as possible origins of the detections. Significant anomalies are detected in the alignment of quadrupole and octopole modes that agree with prior findings utilizing different methodologies.",

Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. Our results showed that gene duplications regularly lead to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the encoded transcription factors and rewiring of regulatory interactions. We analyze how network structure and function changes in response to selective pressures on gene expression levels after duplications. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes.

The model is calculatedself-consistently along with the ionization and thermal structure of thesurrounding nebula. The result is a complete line and continuum spectrum of theplasma. Here we focus on the ions of the He I sequence and reconsider thestandard helium-like X-ray diagnostics. We discuss the various methods used to valuation the line intensity ratios and their limitations. In astrophysics, the diagnostics ont been used to study the plasma properties in the solar corona, the interstellar medium, and in other astrophysical belongings. In particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the$R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on theionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large columndensities. We also introduce the notion that the $R$-ratio is a measure of theincident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which istemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown tobe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well.

The hot wind material is characterized by the presence ofhigh-ionization species such as OVI, OVII, and OVIII (the latter two observableonly in X-ray bands); the colder ($T<10^{5.5}$ K) infalling streams can beinstead identified by the combined presence of SiII, SiIII, and CIII opticalabsorption together with OVI that surrounds the cooler gas clumps.

We present here the results obtained from a code designedto perform chi^2 tests to both spectroscopic models (or the associatedsynthetic photometry) and combinations of blackbodies (including modifiedblackbodies). Some steps in this process can already be done in a VOenvironment, and the rest are in the process of development. This article provides an summarized of the current methods and techniques used in SED fitting for cool objects, as equally as the challenges and limitations of this approach. However, the accuracy of age estimations via SED fitting is influenced by multi factors, including the quality and quantity of observational data, the choice of models, and the pathways used to compare the commentaries to the models. Thismake them excellent examples where to apply the VO capabilities.",

The lack of any bright SN down tovery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,strikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we presentspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that theburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic breakis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with thebreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviourand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the bestexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The unusual duration and hardness of the burst, combined with the well-behaved afterglow, suggest that GRB 060614 was an anomalous burst, differing from traditional fireball-type GRBs and being more consistent with a shock-breakout model.The presentation of the abstract has been polished to meet the academic abstract style, with 14 sentences, improved spelling, grammar, clarity, concision, and overall readability. This study presents the results of our analysis of the Swift observations of GRB 060614, using the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and the X-ray Telescope (XRT).The BAT observation revealed a long-duration GRB with a duration of approximately 200 seconds and a hard spectrum with a photon index of -2.14 ± 0.12. The very blue spectrum at early timesand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying athigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-raylight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extendedemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show thatthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRTobservation. The XRT observation began 84 seconds after the BAT trigger and continued for 10 days, detecting the afterglow at a significance level of 10σ. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24keV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is howeverdistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.Considering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistentwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.",

This allows sufficient separation of scales toobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertialrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports thepredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energyspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes ask^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in thesub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closurein the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist indifferent spatial portions of the flow. To evaluate the performance of the highly turbulent solutions of the LANS-alpha model in LES, we compare them to results from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of shaky waterways. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the strengths and restrained of the highly tumultuous solutions of the LANS-alpha model in LES. From this, we give a methodology eitherfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining aformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fullyconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a directnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balancebetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS insteadof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANScontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallowerenergy spectrum for large alpha. Our results show that the acutely turbulent solutions of the LANS-alpha model are able to taken many of the key features of turbulent flows, containing the statistical properties of the velocity areas and the scaling behavior of the energy spectrum.",

Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperativetransmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques thatenable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperativenodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks byusing the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the loador even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical batterylife. The reverberations demonstrate that the proposed approach can grown the network lifetime by up to 50% in some cases, while also improving the overall network performance. Then, a 2D disk case isanalyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks,if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem isformulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing isdynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and theeffectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seenthat the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disknetwork and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.",

The corrected luminosity function is then used to infer the population properties of white dwarfs in the galaxy. In this paper we focus on the biasesintroduced by the measurement errors and on the effects of the degree ofcontamination of the input sample used to build the disc white dwarf luminosityfunction by different kinematical populations.

We have generated simulated light cones to match the resolution andsensitivity of current and future SZE instruments. Unlike many previous studiesof this type, our simulation includes unbound gas, where an appreciablefraction of the baryons in the universe reside. We have found that cluster line-of-sight overlap may be a significant issuein upcoming single-dish SZE surveys. Smaller beam surveys (~1 arcmin) have morethan one massive cluster within a beam diameter 5-10% of the time, and a largerbeam experiment like Planck has multiple clusters per beam 60% of the time. Our algorithm is tailored to mitigate the confusion between the SZ effect and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (TSZ) effect, which arises from the intrinsic temperature of the gas in galaxy clusters.To achieve this goal, we employ a sophisticated technique that combines high-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters with a novel approach to modeling the TSZ effect. Our simulation project focuses on the development of a new algorithm that accurately models the SZ effect in the presence of complex astrophysical phenomena, such as galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium.The simulation project is designed to address the challenges associated with the upcoming SZ surveys, which will provide unprecedented details of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Thisadds both bias and scatter to the deduced value of the integrated SZE, addingdifficulty in accurately calibrating a cluster Y-M relationship. Finally, we find that in images where objects with M > 5x10^{13} M_{\\odot}have had their SZE signatures removed, roughly a third of the total SZE fluxstill remains. This gas exists at least partially in the Warm Hot IntergalacticMedium (WHIM), and will possibly be detectable with the upcoming generation ofSZE surveys.",

We show that \\CO and \\CSpalso admit natural Hopf algebra structures that are isomorphic to that of \\CGL,and hence to \\Sym.

Theadjoint and Foulkes derivative now require separate definitions, and theirproperties are explored here in the orthogonal and symplectic cases. We also demonstrate that this Hopf algebra structure is closely related to the branching rules of the classical groups, which describe how representations of a subgroup can be decomposed into representations of the parent group. We show that the character rings can be equipped with a Hopf algebra structure, where the product and coproduct are defined using the characters of the group representations.

Yet, the dynamics of the squad dictate that tough decisions must be made regarding the starting lineup, leaving Christie with reduced game time.Nevertheless, the midfielder remains a committed member of the team, demonstrating professionalism and dedication in every training session. Despite this obstacle, he maintains a positive attitude and continues to push himself in training, hoping to impress the coaching staff.Since joining Celtic in 2015, Ryan Christie has established himself as a key player, contributing significantly to the team's success. \"Nice to see them again and I wish them all the best in the future. I spent many good years at Inverness, but it's time to move on now. \"First half, fair credit to Inverness, I think they passed the ball excellently and shocked us a bit. His technical abilities, vision, and goal-scoring prowess have made him a fan favorite. \"I think in front of goal we were more clinical, which can prove vital in these games.\"",

It will provide a tangible link to the past, inviting visitors to reflect on the challenges faced by the mining community and appreciate their enduring legacy.The construction of the memorial will be completed in the coming months, with plans underway for an official unveiling ceremony to coincide with the village's annual festival. \"When the pit closed, only a plaque in the village centre marked the rich industrial heritage.Now, the pit's old headgear will be erected alongside the coast road between Ffynnongroyw and Prestatyn, as a lasting memorial.It is hoped there will also eventually be information boards and a seating area.The FMVHG has raised about Â£4,500 towards the project, and rural development agency Cadwyn Clwyd has provided more than Â£6,000.About 60 local people saw Flintshire councillor Carolyn Thomas cut the first sod on the new site on Tuesday.Before installation, the headgear will be refurbished and painted by engineers.",

It follows other measures designed to spur growth in China, including tax cuts.China's slowdown is expected to continue for some years. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted China's growth would stabilise at about 6% by 2017.Also last week, weaker than expected official figures on both trade and inflation were released. The rate cut suggests data to be published this week, on industrial output and investment, may also disappoint.The country's economic problems also include the property market, which is cooling after a damaging period that saw a speculative bubble emerge.The central bank said in a statement: \"China's economy is still facing relatively big downward pressure. \"At the same time, the overall level of domestic prices remains low, and real interest rates [interest rates relative to inflation] are still higher than the historical average. \"Recent rate cuts have not yet fully filtered through to market rates.Li Qilin, an economist at Minsheng Securities, said: \"The effectiveness of the rate cut won't be very big. Addtionally, the central bank's decision signifies its commitment to alleviating the pressures faced by companies burdened with high debt leovels. It hoeps that this move will drive investments, spur domestic consumption, and ultimately revive the Chinese economy. \"The rate could be lowered to 2% at least, and we expect the economy to gradually stabilise in the coming two quarters.\"",

This article examines the challenges encountered in the pursuit of discovering MSSM Higgs particles at hadron colliders. Firstly, the MSSM Higgs sector involves a complex parameter space with several free parameters, leading to a vast number of possible scenarios to explore. Secondly, the presence of additional Higgs bosons in the MSSM further complicates the search, requiring a comprehensive analysis of various production and decay channels. Thirdly, the inherent suppression of production cross sections and decay branching ratios pose significant challenges in distinguishing MSSM Higgs signals from background processes. Additionally, the SM-like behavior of the observed Higgs particle and the mixture of different MSSM scenarios add further complexity to the analyses. Experimental limitations, such as detector effects and systematic uncertainties, must also be carefully considered when interpreting the search results. In summary, the search for MSSM Higgs bosons at hadron colliders faces myriad challenges arising from the nature of the MSSM framework, the complexity of the Higgs sector, and experimental constraints.",

Through rigorous mathematical modeling and computational simulations, we analyze the behavior of energy conservation laws in the presence of this extra dimension.

Previous studies have provided qualitative descriptions of this phenomenon; however, a systematic framework to rigorously analyze and predict the period of oscillation has been lacking.The primary objective of this study is to establish a robust mathematical model that accurately characterizes the periodic oscillation of the adiabatic piston. By considering a comprehensive thermodynamic approach combined with the principles of classical mechanics, we derive a set of differential equations describing the dynamic behavior of the system. Utilizing advanced numerical methods, we simulate the system's behavior under different initial conditions and physical parameters, verifying the accuracy of our mathematical model.Through extensive computations and statistical analysis of the simulation results, we identify key factors that influence the period of oscillation. These factors include the initial pressure and temperature of the gas, the dimensions of the piston, and the compressibility factor of the gas. Moreover, the presence of any external forces acting on the piston is investigated, providing insights into their impact on the oscillatory behavior.To validate our findings, we conduct comparative experiments on a physical prototype of the adiabatic piston under carefully controlled conditions.

High-resolution commentary obtained from the state-of-the-art observatory reveal distinct method suggestive of a planetary body within the circumstellar disk of the young star. The observations were committed using advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques, allowing for a comprehensive exam of the system's dynamics and composition. Through careful analysis of the data, we have identified umpteen key signatures that indicate the presence of a planet. Firstly, we observe disagreements in the radial velocity of the star, indicative of a newtonian interaction with an orbiting body. Additionally, our observations reveal localized gaps and asymmetries in the protoplanetary disk, potentially driven by the gravitational influence exerted by the planetary courtesan. Further analysis of the spectroscopic data provides insights into the composition of the disk, and preliminary layouts suggest that the observed features are uniformed with the presence of a fuel giant planet. The estimated mass and orbital parameters of the planet indicate that it slump within the amplitude of the known population of young exoplanets. This finding reinforces the current brainchild of planet formation and evolution. Furthermore, by characterizing the traits of this young planetary system, we gain valuable insights into the quick stages of planet formation and the potential for habitable environments in similar system. The proximity of this young star also offers a unique opportunity for future follow-up observations, comprising direct imaging and climatic studies of the planet.

However, in most models, gauge mediation suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large masses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The strong dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses. This allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass.

At lowest order in the slow-roll expansion, the metric perturbations induce a non-linear electric current. As a consequence, Alfvén modes are excited from a vacuum state. We provide a complete treatment, without resorting to the often-used approximation of neglecting the anisotropic stress. We show that in this case the resulting Alfvén mode function is more involved than the one computed in the isotropic limit. We verify that the induced magnetic field is of the order of the Hubble scale during inflation. This result hints that observational constraints on primordial magnetic fields might be relaxed in anisotropic inflation.",

We construct a joint application network based on patent data from 1990 to 2004, where nodes represent firms and links represent joint patent applications. We analyze the network's spatial structure and identify factors influencing the formation of spatial clusters. Our results show that the joint application network exhibits significant spatial clustering. Firms located in the same region are more likely to collaborate on patent applications than firms located in different regions. This spatial clustering is more pronounced for firms in high-technology industries and for firms that are geographically close to each other. We also find evidence that spatial clusters are associated with higher levels of innovation output. Firms located in spatial clusters are more likely to produce patents that are cited by other patents, suggesting that spatial clusters foster innovation. Our findings have implications for understanding the geography of innovation and the role of spatial proximity in the formation of collaborative networks.",

However, traditional frequent pattern mining methods do not consider the distribution of patterns within the data set. As a result, they may find patterns that are frequent in some parts of the data set but infrequent in others. This can make it difficult to understand the overall structure of the data set.In this paper, we propose a novel frequent pattern mining method that takes into account the distribution of patterns within the data set. Our method, called balanced interval mining, mines patterns that are frequent in all parts of the data set. This is achieved by using a balanced interval, which is a time interval that is divided into equal-sized subintervals. Patterns are only considered to be frequent if they appear in at least one subinterval of the balanced interval.We show that our method can discover patterns that are more representative of the overall structure of the data set than traditional frequent pattern mining methods. Our method is also more efficient than traditional frequent pattern mining methods, as it can prune a large number of infrequent patterns.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of data sets. Our results show that our method can discover patterns that are more representative of the overall structure of the data set and that our method is more efficient than traditional frequent pattern mining methods.",

In the periodic anyo model, the anyons are confined to a periodic lattice. In the nonperiodic anyon model, the anyons are not confied to a lattice, but can move fheely throughout the plane. The nonperiodic anyon model can be used to describe a wide variety of FQE states, including the Laughlin state, the Moore-Read state, and the Pfaffian satte. The model can also be used to describe the FVQHE in the presence of disorder and interactions. The nonperiodic aynon model is a powerful tool for understanding the FQHE.

In the first paper of this series, the rotation curve of the Milky Way was analyzed using stellar and gas kinematic tracers to constrain the distribution of dark matter in the galactic halo. This follow up study focuses specifically on using HI as a tracer to infer properties of the dark matter halo. High-resolution observations of HI emission from Milky Way galaxies provide an excellent tracer of the total gravitational potential as HI is dynamically cold and extended throughout the disk. A 3D HI emission cube of the Milky Way is compiled combining data from existing Milky Way HI surveys to construct the most complete map to date. The HI distribution is analyzed to derive the velocity field as a function of position.A parameterized model for the total gravitational potential is adopted including contributions from baryonic components like stars and gas as well as dark matter. The density profile and mass of the dark matter halo are free parameters which are varied to find the best fit model that reproduces the observed Hi velocity field. Additional constraints from stellar and gas kinematic tracers are also taken into account.The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space. The sampling explores a wide range of halo masses, density profiles, and halo shapes. The best fit halo is spherical with a virial mass of 0.8-1.2 ×1012 solar masses and a concentration parameter consistent with expectations from ΛCDM simulations.The analysis finds that the HI rotation curve provides strong independent constraints on the dark matter halo properties. The results are consistent with those of the first paper and help confirm the presence of a massive dark matter halo surrounding the Milky Way.",

Through analytical methods, the author derives the conditions under which Maxwell strata can form within Euler's elastic problem based on the variational principle of minimizing potential energy. The presence of Maxwell strata is demonstrated to influence the critical load and buckling mode of classic elastic structures. The results clarify long-standing questions regarding the nature of instability in Euler’s classic models and provide a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of structural failure mechanisms.",

The Santa Fe Light Cone Simulation Project also includes a comprehensive analy sis of the impact of various astrophysical processes on the SZ effect, such as the involvements of cool ɡas in the center of galaxy clusters and the effects of galaxy formation and evolution. O ur ѕimulations produce a wealth of data that can be used to analyze the SZ effect in a variety of ways, include the stacking of SZ signals from individual galaxy clusters and the cross-correⅼation of SZ signals with other cosmological probes. The project's findingѕ have importɑnt implications for the interpretation of SZ surveys and the extraction of cosmological information from these data.",

We first present a model for the network struc𝚝ure, which caught the essential features of small-world networks, including short cuts and long-range connections. We then introduce a diffusion process on the network, where the probability of a node adopting a new be havior or idea depends on the distance between the nodes and the number of linking between them. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we researches the spread of information, influence, or diseases on the networ𝒌. Our results show that the distance-dependent raոdom links have a significant impact on the diffusion process, leading to faster and more efficient spreading comparеd to traditional small-world networks. We also find that the optimal frequencу of long-range connections, which maximizes the spread rate, decreases as the distance between nodes increases. This sugests that in order to maximize the spread of details or influence, it is important to carefully balance the number of long-range links and their distribution across the network. Our results have major implications for understanding the spread of informatioո, influence, or diseases in complex networks, and can be applied to a wide range of scopes, including social networks, transportation networks, and biological networks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model and suggest directions for impending research.

In response to mounting reports and widespread public oսtcry, local authorities have initiated a crackԁown on begging, aiming to restore peace and security to the city. Concerns relating rising anti-social behavior have reached a tipping point, propmting municipal authorities to implement measures targeting the issue head-on. The crackdown specifically focuses on tackling the implications of begging, which has been closely lin𝒌ed to the surge in anti-social behavior. Local law enforcement organ are collaborating with community stakeholders to offer alternative support networking for those caught in the cycle of begging and substance abuse. By providing access to consulting services, addiction treatment, and job training programs, the administration aims to address the underlying social factors that contribute to such bеhaviors. Additionally, the city council a ims to increase the visibility of community outreach programs, providing support for vulnerable individuals who may have resorted to implore due to circumstances beyond their control. By offering ɑssistance and resources, the hope is to provide viable solutions and steer individuals away from anti-social activities. Glouces ter citizens are encouraged to report any instances of anti-social behavior or concerns related to begging to the local authоrities.

The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. Inthe temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient islarger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows thatthis difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can berefered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamicfactor \\Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force forinterdiffusion.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weaklyinteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBHcan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due toannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or evenexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thuspredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinityof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burnersare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degeneratecores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for theexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish itsdensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMPburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate coremasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with theobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could beconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. Wealso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux ofgamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the darkmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that theEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precisionmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matterspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringentlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.",

Thiscalls into question the validity of the constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of statein problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes acrosshydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recoverprimitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservativeones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophicnumerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (includingmagnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared usingdifferent equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of arealistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution whentransitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under thesecircumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger thesolution.",

Global rateconstant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products havebeen calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowedto validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that therotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are ofimportance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals.

We find that the fractionof disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The largesample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linearrelations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in theisophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlationsbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in theoptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, grouphierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can beaccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxyluminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shapeof early-type galaxies.",

Thedynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shellequations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetarinflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. Thebubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidalmagnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsarwind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct valueof E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion ofmagnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; weargue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely tobe significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show thatfor a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetarL_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to therotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This canaccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasinglymagnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-drivenmass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that themagnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing theenergy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomesprogressively more collimated, producing the GRB.",

Aims.In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples ofblazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statisticalproperties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-likeproperties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopicallyidentify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method.

Our catalog includes 173 new blazaridentifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars.

Here we report the direct observation of LL of DF by means oflow temperature Scanning-Tunnelling-Spectroscopy (STS) on the surface ofgraphite in fields up to 12 Tesla. We find evidence of coexistence of masslessand massive DF, and identify the zero-energy LL which is a unique consequenceof their quantum-relativistic nature.

Suitable corrections have to be introduced when theaccretion rate approaches or exceeds the Eddington limit. We summarizephenomenological models that can explain the very high state, with apparentlyhigher disk temperatures and lower inner-disk radii. Conversely, ultraluminousX-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. Weintroduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state. We arguethat a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than acharacteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is theaccretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.For R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermalprocesses. We predict the location of such sources in a luminosity-temperatureplot.

OO Ser was monitored with theInfrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground andcomplemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. Weanalysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructedlight curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energydistributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.According to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independentfading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayedwavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading ratesindicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. Theoutburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longerthan that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggestthat OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities tothe recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energydistribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class Iobject, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by anaccretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales,the viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order ofmagnitude higher than usual for FUors.",

By comparing a discrete and a continuous versionof the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization doesnot alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fibernetwork on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varyingoccupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It isshown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporatedin the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, thepersistence length, affect particle diffusion.

A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usualuniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing twodirectors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

For a neutral atom-based architecture, a natural way to connectthese regions is to use optical tweezers to move qubits within the system. Inthis letter we demonstrate the coherent transport of a qubit, encoded on anatom trapped in a sub-micron tweezer, over a distance typical of the separationbetween atoms in an array of optical traps. Furthermore, we transfer a qubitbetween two tweezers, and show that this manipulation also preserves thecoherence of the qubit.",

We estimate the amount offading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviationfrom the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellarpopulations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading isconsistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching ofstar formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation methodfor S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm thatprevious results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by theS_N - Age relation. Five galaxies show detectable Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha or[NII] emission lines. However, only in the two youngest galaxies is thisemission unambiguously from star formation. Our results are consistent with thetheory that S0 galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed,possibly as a result of a change in environment. The on-going star formation inthe youngest galaxies hints that the timescale of quenching is ~< 1 Gyr.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.

In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks byusing the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the loador even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical batterylife. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strengthat a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case isanalyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks,if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem isformulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing isdynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and theeffectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seenthat the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disknetwork and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.",

However, it has become clear that duration alone isinsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. GRB060912A had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, lowredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been thehost, which would favour it being a short-burst.

Valenti & Fischer(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the SolarNeighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibratepotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars fromthe Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysisshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeitwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.Supplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give acomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs isbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of theGalactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetarycompanions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companionswithin 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating thatthose systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older,lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implyingmembership of the thick disk.

Here we presentspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that theburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic breakis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with thebreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviourand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the bestexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglowlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there isstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a breakfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early timesand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying athigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-raylight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extendedemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show thatthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRTobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exitsit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24keV but larger than 8 keV.

This allows sufficient separation of scales toobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertialrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports thepredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energyspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes ask^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in thesub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closurein the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist indifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling issubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsiblefor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with nointernal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANSattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology eitherfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining aformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fullyconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a directnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balancebetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS insteadof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANScontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallowerenergy spectrum for large alpha.

The opticalmorphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sidedspiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offsetphotometric and kinematic centers. The HI distribution is mildly asymmetricand, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows theoptical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 Holmberg radii (wheremu_B = 26.5 mag/arcsec^2). In particular, the highest HI column densitiesclosely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. Therotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the opticalextent. The total HI flux F_HI = 23.1 pm 1.2 Jy km/s, yielding a total HI massM_HI= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 Msun (for a distance D = 10.8 pm 1.4 Mpc) and a totalHI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B = (0.96 pm 0.14) Msun / Lsun,B(distance independent). The HI data suggest a very complex small-scale HIstructure, with evidence of large shells and/or holes, but deeper observationsare required for a detailed study. Follow-up observations are also desirablefor a proper comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud, where despite anoptical morphology very similar to ESO 364-G 029 the HI bears littleresemblance to the optical.",

Recentexperimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interfacemicrostructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional paraboliccoarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of thesemicrostructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the drivingforce, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law forcoarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grainboundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting anintrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystallinemetals.",

This paper presents atime-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existingapproximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependentdensity-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to bea conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into anyexisting adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied todriven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonicpotential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice oftime-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabaticlocal-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlineartwo-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated withdouble excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabaticapproximation.",

The present work is a continuation of theprevious work, but assumes a more realistic model of CR propagation in theGalaxy. The previous work assumed an unbounded three-dimensional diffusionregion, whereas the present one considers a flat cylindrical disc bounded inboth the radial and vertical directions. The study has found that the effect ofthe vertical halo boundary $H$ on the local SNR contribution to the observed CRanisotropy is negligible as long as $H\\gtrsim 2kpc$. Considering the values ofthe halo height $H\\gtrsim 2kpc$ obtained by different authors, the present worksuggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the CR anisotropy canbe carried out without having much information on $H$ and hence, using the muchsimpler three-dimentional unbounded solution. Finally, the present workdiscusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below theknee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters, andclaims that the source may be an \\textit{undetected} old SNR with acharacteristic age of $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^5 yr$ located at a distance of $\\sim0.57 kpc$ from the Sun.",

This article provides a comprehensive review of parity doubling phenomena, focusing on its theoretical framework, experimental evidence, and potential implications. Theoretical descriptions of parity doubling involve the breaking of discrete symmetries in the underlying theories, leading to the doubling of particle states with opposite parity. This intriguing concept has been explored in various theoretical frameworks, including extensions of the Standard Model, supersymmetry, and string theory. Experimental evidence supporting parity doubling has been obtained through high-energy particle collisions and precision measurements. These experiments have revealed intriguing patterns of particle spectra and decay properties that are consistent with parity doubling predictions. We show the evolution ofvarious ideas about parity doubling. We begin with early approaches of 1960s(Regge theory and dynamical symmetries) and end up with the latest trends(manifestations of broader degeneracies and AdS/QCD). Furthermore, parity doubling could provide valuable insights into the nature of dark matter, the hierarchy problem, and the origin of the Universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. This review also discusses ongoing research efforts to explore and test parity doubling predictions further. Experimental studies at particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, and precision measurements in low-energy experiments hold great promise for advancing our knowledge of parity doubling and its relevance to particle physics.

However, traditional parametric learning methods often suffer from high computational costs and convergence issues when applied to large-scale problems. In contrast, Monte Carlo optimization leverages random sampling to explore the solution space and estimate the objective function. This stochastic approach enables the identification of promising regions in the search space, but it may suffer from convergence limitations and lack of accuracy.By combining parametric learning with Monte Carlo optimization, we propose a novel approach that addresses the limitations of each technique. Accordingly, by combining these first twocontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. Immediate sampling transforms the original BOproblem into an MCO problem.

In this study, we investigate the characteristics and effects of magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks. We consider different scenarios, including the presence of dust grains and their influence on the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Our analysis reveals that when no grains or grains larger than 1 micron are present, the magnetic field is well coupled to the gas in the midplane. However, the introduction of small grains (0.1 micron) results in reduced magnetic activity and limited coupling between the field and the fluid. We find that Ohmic diffusion dominates at certain radii, while ambipolar diffusion becomes severe at larger distances, hindering magnetic coupling throughout the disk. However, once grains havegrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fieldscan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions aregenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions whileelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of themagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas. Despite these effects, MRI modes still exhibit growth over a wide range of magnetic field strengths, with Hall diffusion playing a crucial role in the inner regions of the disk.Overall, our results suggest that the magnetic field can maintain coupling with the gas and exhibit shear even when small dust grains are mixed with the gas in protoplanetary disks. While the magnetic coupling is reduced, it is still influential in driving fluid motion. The presence of dust grains alters the properties of perturbations and the range of magnetic field strengths for which MRI-unstable modes exist. They have the potential to efficiently transport angularmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration ofoutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implicationsfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population.",

The CPDswere found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups.The slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolvesfrom -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There arebreaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies withindices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation between the intensity and Jwidth of giant pulses. Our analysis reveals a ositive correlation, indicating that brighter pulses tend to be wider. This correlation provides valuable insights into the emission mechanism and physical conditoins of the pulsar magnetosphere. Cumulative probabilitydistributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPswith different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. Our results suggest that the emission from the pulsar is subject to complex polarization modulation, likely arising from the combbned feffects of coherent and incoherent emission processes.

[assistant]: The abstract of the academic article \"Dark Matter in Gauge Mediation from Emergent Supersymmetry\" could be as following:Gauge mediation is a well-motivated mechanism to transmit supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector. However, in most models, gauge mediation suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large masses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast totraditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark mattercandidate. Squarks and sleptons obtaintheir soft masses dominantly through gauge mediation with other mechanismshighly suppressed. This allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass. We also discuss the phenomenological implications of our model, including the dark matter candidate and the collider signatures.",

This can make it difficult to understand the overall structure of the data set.In this paper, we propose a novel frequent pattern mining method that takes into account the distribution of patterns within the data set. Our method, called balanced interval mining, mines patterns that are frequent in all parts of the data set. This is achieved by using a balanced interval, which is a time interval that is divided into equal-sized subintervals. Furthermore we propose a simplerapproach for pruning patterns with a balanced interval, making estimating thepruning threshold more intuitive. It was noticed that some very frequent patterns obviously also occur with abalanced interval, meaning in every transaction.

The sample is selected based on the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. It contains 1349 blazars (1254 BL Lac objects and 95 flat-spectrum radio quasars) over an area of approximately 20 000 deg2. Our catalog therefore includes manynew potential targets for GeV-TeV observations. In addition, we investigate the multi-frequency properties of the sample, encompassing the spectral energy distributions and radio-loudness. Our findings indicate that the ROXA sample is representative of the blazar population as a whole. Therefore, it can be employed for a variety of statistical studies of blazars.",

The framework utilizes the formalism of Yang-Mills theory, providing a robust toolset for comprehending the dynamics of these extended objects. A Lagrangian describing the dynamics of D-particles is formulated in terms of gauge and matter fields. The gauge invariance of Yang-Mills quantummechanics is reinterpreted as a quantum-statistical symmetry, which is takeninto account by setting up a novel algebraic and projective structure in theformalism. Furthermore, the underlying mathematical structure, including gauge symmetries, conserved currents, and equations of motion, is explored. The developed formalism offers a systematic framework for investigating the quantum behavior and interactions of D-particles. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of string theory, where D-particles are fundamental objects.",

Charge order, where the charge distribution exhibits a regular pattern, is usually viewed as a precursor to superconductivity. The interplay between charge order and lattice distortion, called electron-lattice coupling, is crucial for understanding the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. At finite temperatures, we compare the free energies ofvarious charge-ordered states and find a first-order transition from a metallicstate with 3-fold charge order to the insulating state with the horizontalcharge order. Combining theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, we demonstrate that the electron-lattice coupling significantly enhances the charge order and decreases the superconducting transition temperature.

Its front-illuminated (FI) CCDs have endured from a gradual increase in the dark current, which is a serious difficulty for faint X-ray observations. This dark current increase is casued by the charge injection (CI) effect induced by cosmic-ray hits. In this paper, we study the CI effeϲt in detail to clarify its properties. We measure the dependence of the IC current on the CCD temperature, the incident X-ray stream, and the cosmic-ray flux. The CI current increases as the CCD temperature d ecreases and as the X-ray flux increases. Theamount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measuredwith the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with thecalibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection techniquecan accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than thecalibration sources. We find that the CI current is not directly propor𝚝ional to the cosmic-ray flux. The CI current depends on not only the cosmic-ray flux but al so the cosmic-ray energy. We estimate the number of injected electronѕ per cosmic-ray hit as a function of the cosmic-ray energy. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibrationsource spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with acolumn-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average atthe time of one year after the launch).",

This follow up study focuses specifically on using HI as a tracer to infer properties of the dark matter halo. High-resolution observations of HI emission from Milky Way galaxies provide an excellent tracer of the total gravitational potential as HI is dynamically cold and extended throughout the disk. A 3D HI emission cube of the Milky Way is compiled combining data from existing Milky Way HI surveys to construct the most complete map to date. The HI distribution is analyzed to derive the velocity field as a function of position.A parameterized model for the total gravitational potential is adopted including contributions from baryonic components like stars and gas as well as dark matter. The resulting MilkyWay rotation curve is flat up to R~27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. Results.Besides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find aself-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a darkmatter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun.

We provethis by transforming the problem into an algebraic one: finding the rank ofsuccessive products of a given set of numbers. Asymptotic analysis further demonstrates that the beta-like distribution demonstrates power law scaling in its upper tail.

Their detection could provide insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, directly imaging exomoons with current telescopes is enormously challenging due to their small sizes and large distances from Earth. We investigate an alternative method for characterizing exomoons based on photometric transit timing variations. We developed a theoretical model to predict the timing deviations caused by an exomoon as its host planet transits its host star. Our model shows that the amplitude of these deviations scales predictably with the exomoon's physical properties, including its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. The exactvalue of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size ofthe satellite and the planet. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon systemin front of the Sun. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to constrain an exomoon's mass to within 50% and radius to within 20% for objects larger than 0.5 Earth radii using this technique with current facilities. We discuss the factors that determine measurement precision, such as exomoon size, orbital separation, and signal-to-noise ratio of the observations. This method holds promise for establishing the prevalence of exomoons and gaining new insights into the formation of satellites outside our solar system.

Their detection could provide perceptions into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, directly imaging exomoons with current telescopes is extremely challenging due to their small pruning and large distance from Territorial. Here we analyzed an alternative method for characterizing exomoons based on photometric transit timing variations. We develop a theoretical model to predict the timing deviations caused by an exomoon as its host mundos transits its host stars. We show that the amplitude of these distinctions scales predictably with the exomoon's physical trait including its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. If we include the realdensity ratio (about 0.6), the results are 0.010 Earth-Mass and 0.253Earth-size, which agree with the real values within 20%. Since two of those parameters are independent, areliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size andthe mass of the exomoon. Our results demonstrate that it is conceivable to constrain an exomoon's mass to within 50% and radius to within 20% for objects larger than 0.5 Earth radii exploited this technique with current plant. We discuss the factors that determine the measurement precision such as exomoon size, orbital fracture, and banners to noise of the observations.

Overall, our findings stronglysuggest that the generally accepted approach of extending the structuralinformation acquired from crystallographic data to a L-alanine molecule inaqueous solution should be used with caution. In contrast, the crystalline form is much more rigid, with a highly ordered structure.

The proposed protocols are designed to take advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels and improve the performance of cooperative transmission systems. The use of multiuser detection allows for the improvement of one user's link to benefit other users, while network coding enables the relay to fully utilize the link between the relay and the destination. The coding gain and high diversity order can beobtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination. The performance of the proposed scheme is near optimal, with a performance gap of 0.12dB for average BER of 10^-6 and 1.04dB for average BER of 10^-3, compared to two performance upper bounds. The proposed protocols have the potential to significantly improve the performance of future wireless networks.",

Splitting trees have been widely studied in the field of mathematics, particularly in the context of geometric functions and their limits. However, the connection between splitting trees and Lévy processes has not been well-established. Our research aims to bridge this gap by demonstrating that the contour of splitting trees can be characterized as a Lévy process.We begin by providing a thorough explanation of splitting trees and their properties. We demonstrate that the contour of a splitting tree can be viewed as a random fractal, which is a subset of the complex plane that exhibits self-similarity. We then introduce the concept of Lévy processes and their characteristics, including their ability to model random motion and the presence of “fat tails” in their distribution.Our main result shows that the contour of a splitting tree can be represented as a Lévy process. We introduce a total order onexistence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\\varphi$ from the treeinto the real line which preserves this order.

Although exact details of the proposed cap were not provided, it signifies a mindset focused on safeguarding national interests while navigating the post-Brexit landscape.Critics argue that such a move could hinder the UK's long-standing commitment to promoting international cooperation and open borders. \"The recent debate around immigration has focussed largely on the arrival of citizens from Romania and Bulgaria into the UK.Many argue that newspaper predictions about being Britain being 'swamped' by a new wave of migrants from Eastern Europe proved wide of the mark.My colleague Sarah Corker travelled to Romania to produce a special report for Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.She found that many Romanians are worried about young, skilled workers leaving the country, creating a 'brain drain' in hospitals, schools and universities.
