TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed.

The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation.

The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K isanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlatedwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10xless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness inthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR.

Sound transmission is a non -broken test technology that is usually used to monitor the integrity of the structure and detect damage in various materials and components. However, accurately positioning multiple AE sources in real time is still a challenging task. The proposed method uses advanced signal processing technology and machine learning algorithm to locate multiple AE sources at the same time. The proposed methods include three main stages. First, the signal pre -processing is performed to improve the quality of the AE signal obtained and extract related functions. This pre -processing step aims to reduce noise and enhance the detection of a single AE event. Secondly, a new type of cluster algorithm is used to group similar AE events according to its space and time characteristics. By gathering the AE event, the algorithm aims to determine the sources in the overall record signal. Finally, use a localized algorithm based on machine learning to estimate the space coordinates of each recognized AE source. In order to verify the proposed method, a wide range of experiments were conducted using the simulation environment with multiple AE sources. The results show that even if there is noise and overlapping signals, the proposed method can accurately locate multiple AE sources. The comparative analysis of the existing positioning technology further establishes the advantages of proposed methods, in terms of accuracy and robustness.

The corresponding relationship between the AD/CFT is a well -known duality between the gravity theory in the anti -de nanny (ADS) space and the preparatory field theory (CFT) defined on the space boundary. In this work, we studied the role of Landau-Lifshitz Sigma-Models. This model is a live theory describing magnetic material dynamics. We focus on containing Fermiko freedom in Landau-Lifshitz Sigma-Models and its meaning to ADS/CFT. Fermiko is a basic particle with a semi -content spin. Their existence can significantly affect the dynamics of the system. By incorporating Fermiko into Landau-Lifshitz Sigma-Models, we aim to explore how their interaction and behavior affect the basic gravity theory in ADS space. In addition, we studied the consequences of this kind of CFT contained in the boundary defined on the boundary. Specifically, we have studied the influence of Fermi on the theoretical of the dual-co-form field, and the microscope characteristics of the field theory are related to the macro phenomenon observed by the magnetic material described by Landau-Lifshitz Sigma-Models. By analyzing the degree of freedom of Feimzi, the interaction between Landau-Lifshitz Sigma-Models and ADS/CFT, we aims to deepen the understanding of basic physics. This study has an impact on both condensing material systems and gravity theory, clarifying the complex connection between magnetic materials, Fermiko and holographic chart. Our discovery helps a wider range of theoretical physics fields, so as to provide new opinions for the complexity of these interconnected phenomena.",

By utilizing the Spitzer IRS, researchers have a unique opportunity to analyze the mid-infrared emission lines from AGNs, offering valuable insights into the properties of the obscuring torus.To measure the line ratios of key emission lines ([NeIII]/[NeII], [OIV]/[NeII], and [SIV]/[NeII]) as diagnostics, a sample of AGNs with available Spitzer IRS spectra is analyzed. This analysis reveals a significant diversity in the line ratios among the AGN sample, indicating variations in the properties of the obscuring torus.

Using multi-wavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis, we have identified this star, named CygOB2-14R, as an extraordinary member of early-type stars, with an estimated mass exceeding 80 solar masses. The runaway nature of CygOB2-14R is indicated by its anomalously high proper motion and its location outside the central region of Cygnus OB2. Through meticulous modeling and simulation, we propose that CygOB2-14R was formed through a binary interaction process that involved a supernova explosion in a close binary system.

Compared our data with delay observation of other SNE IA and various published models. SN 2001EL's ossification optical curve is consistent with T^-2 tails, and is similar to the SN 1994D optical curve comparable to the period. The optical color of SN 2001EL is also similar to the optical color of SN 1994D. However, the spectrum of the two SNEs is different. SN 2001EL shows weaker [Fe III] λλ4472, 4511, and [Fe II] λλ4289, 4333. In NIR, SN 2001EL is brighter than normal IA in the late stage. This excessive launch may be due to the formation of dust in the spray. The quality and composition of the dust are estimated based on the comparison with the dust SN model. We found that the quality of the dust was 0.03 msun, which contains mixtures with graphite and silicate grains. SN 2001EL's dust formation efficiency is similar to that of the dust of SN 1981B, but the dust efficiency less than SN 1994D.",

The helium-weak stars have a helium deficiency compared to normal stars of the same spectral type, while the helium-strong stars have a helium overabundance. The atmospheric parameters, effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity, and projected rotational velocity were determined from detailed line profile fitting. The stellar masses and ages were then estimated by comparing the theoretical stellar evolution tracks on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This study contributes to the understanding of atomic diffusion and other stellar phenomena in intermediate-mass stars on or near the main sequence. The examination of the fundamental parameters may provide insights into the physical processes responsible for the anomalous surface helium abundances in these stars.",

Our results show that the coupling between the electrons and the phonons leads to avoided crossings between the two excitations, which manifests itself as an expansion of the Kondo regime to higher temperatures. The presence of the coupling increases the effective scattering and enables the enhancement of Kondo screening at higher temperatures than in the conventional Kondo regime. Our calculations also reveal Fano-like features in the dot spectral function, which arise from the interference between Kondo-screened and phonon-dressed channels. We find that the dynamic modulation of the coupling between the electrons and the phonons causes the Kondo temperature to increase quasi-periodically with the strength of the coupling. In summary, our work demonstrates an experimentally tunable approach to enhance and control the Kondo effect by coupling to local lattice vibrations.",

Preliminary results suggest that the amplitude and power of the p-mode oscillations may be reduced within some penumbral filaments, while the periods remain similar to the surroundings. This would indicate that the p-modes are partially absorbed rather than scattered. Further analysis is needed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to statistically characterize any modifications across a larger sample of penumbral filaments.

The preliminary test of example users found that new indicators can reliable users with different skills and various input methods with different skills.

We investigate an alternative method for characterizing exomoons based on photometric transit timing variations. We developed a theoretical model to predict the timing deviations caused by an exomoon as its host planet transits its host star. Our model shows that the amplitude of these deviations scales predictably with the exomoon's physical properties, including its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. We tested our model using numerical simulations of transiting planetary systems containing exomoons with a range of masses and orbits.

The study focuses on the temporal evolution of the turbulence spectrum and its dependence on various plasma parameters. The spectral index is found to depend on the temperature and density of the plasma, with steeper spectra at higher temperatures and lower densities. The study also investigates the effect of the scale of the inhomogeneous structure on the turbulence spectrum. The simulations show the presence of a dissipative band at high wave numbers, which is attributed to the presence of small-scale turbulence. The study also finds that the presence of a sheared magnetic field can significantly modify the turbulence spectrum, resulting in a flatter spectral index and a broader spectral range.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin / DP116 attachment in normal and MDX mouse schwann cells. Our results showed that beta-dystroglycan processing significantly affected the expression and localization of utrophin and DP116 in normal and MDX mouse schwann cells.

We first proposed the model of the network structure, which captured the basic characteristics of the small world network, including shortcuts and remote connections. Then, we introduced a diffusion process on the network, where the probability of the node adopting new behaviors or ideas depends on the distance between nodes and the number of links between them. Using the combination of analysis methods and numerical methods, we have studied information on the Internet, affecting the spread of diseases or diseases. Our results show that compared with the traditional small world network, random links dependent on distance have had a significant impact on the diffusion process, which led to faster and more effective diffusion. We also found that as the distance between nodes increases, the optimal frequency of maximizing the diffusion rate will decrease. This shows that in order to maximize the spread of information or influence, it is very important to carefully balance the number of remote connections and its distribution in the entire network. Our results are of great significance to understanding information in complex networks, affecting or dissemination of diseases, and can be applied to a wide range of areas including social networks, transportation networks and biological networks. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the model and put forward the direction of future research.

However, we argue that this idea poses a significant threat to the field of astronomy. The introduction of Dark Energy, an unobserved and mysterious form of energy, violates the fundamental principles of physics. Furthermore, the arbitrary nature of its properties, such as its sudden appearance and unchanging density, undermines the scientific method and our ability to understand the universe.The reliance on Dark Energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe has stifled innovation and the development of alternative, more plausible theories. Additionally, the focus on Dark Energy has distracted from the study of other cosmological phenomena, such as the nature of matter and the formation of galaxies. The promotion of Dark Energy has led to the suppression of debate and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints, damaging the scientific community's integrity.Moreover, the acceptance of Dark Energy has resulted in a lack of investment in experiments and observations that could challenge its validity. The teaching of Dark Energy as established fact, rather than speculative theory, has misled a generation of students and limited their understanding of the universe. Finally, the persistence of the Dark Energy paradigm has contributed to a wider public disillusionment with science and its ability to provide meaningful answers to fundamental questions.We conclude that the concept of Dark Energy is damaging to astronomy and urge a re-evaluation of its role in our understanding of the universe.",

        "text": "In this study, we investigate the properties of quasars at redshift z~6 using millimeter and radio observations. Our sample consists of 12 quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and followed up with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We detected millimeter and radio emission from all 12 quasars, with luminosities spanning 10^26 to 10^28 W Hz^(-1). The millimeter and radio spectra exhibit diverse shapes, including flat or slightly inverted spectra in some quasars, and steep spectra in others. By interpreting these observations within the context of quasar evolution, we find that the flat-spectrum sources are likely young, recently triggered quasars, while the steep-spectrum sources are older, more evolved quasars. Our results offer fresh insights into the early stages of quasar evolution and emphasize the significance of multi-wavelength observations in understanding the growth and development of supermassive black holes.",

First, we examine the fundamental principles of torsional geometries, including their underlying structures. Then, we explore the concept of index theorems and their applicability to torsional geometries. Through a series of rigorous computations and logical derivations, we demonstrate the validity of several index theorems in the context of torsional geometries. Our results offer valuable insights into the interplay between torsional geometries and index theorems, revealing the deeper mathematical structures that govern their behavior. The findings have significant implications for the study of geometric analysis and the pursuit of novel applications in physics and engineering.After polishing, the abstract has 6 sentences, improved spelling, grammar, clarity, concision, and readability.

John Hodge has done a wonderful job, as he did with the original.\"McGregor has said he does not have any nerves about returning to the part of Renton.Speaking to the Press Association ahead of the release of his new movie Our Kind Of Traitor, he said: \"It's such an amazing script, penned by John Hodge who wrote the original Trainspotting script, so there's a real excitement about it.\"Like every movie you do, you have things to think about leading up to them. There is a nervousness about it, but I'm not nervous because it's a sequel to Trainspotting.\"",

As soon as he began to speak I could smell something on his breath which I was thought was stale alcohol.\"He mentioned that he did have a little trouble in finding somewhere to park, which immediately raised concerns.\"Shortly after he arrived in the small office, the smell of alcohol became overpowering.\"The interviewer then made his excuses at the end of the interview and left the room to ask a police officer's advice.A traffic officer quizzed the man over whether he had been drinking but he was adamant that not a drop had touched his lips that morning.However Mr Jackson did admit to sharing a bottle of wine with his wife the night before during a meal out.The traffic officer then marched him out of the building to a nearby patrol car and gave him a breathalyser test, which he duly failed.",

It described the claim that employees brought files to Uber with the goal of creating \"copycat\" technology as \"demonstrably false.\"Mr. Levandowski has declined to testify in the case, launched in February.The firing was confirmed by an Uber spokeswoman, who said it was effective Tuesday.Mr Levandowski had already been removed from working on the self-driving car technology at the heart of the suit.He started working at Uber in August 2016, when the firm bought Otto, the self-driving truck start-up he had created in the six months after leaving Google.He declined to testify earlier this year, citing his right to avoid self-incrimination.Uber maintains its technology is different to Waymo's and says there isn't evidence the files are on its servers. But its search did not include Mr Levandowski's computer.Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case in San Francisco, earlier ordered Uber to return the thousands of \"pilfered\" files in question by the end of the month.A spokeswoman for Uber said the firing occurred after Mr Levandowski failed to meet the deadline that would allow Uber to cooperate with the judge's order.Word of the firing was sent to employees on Tuesday.Attorneys for Mr Levandowski could not be reached for comment immediately.",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

I had no control over it. It would just hang down by my side,\" he said.Mr Stewart was then referred to specialist consultant plastic surgeon Dean Boyce in Morriston, who took muscle from his thigh to act as a bicep.After a further year of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy, he was able to bend his arm.Two months ago, a tendon was switched from his wrist to his hand, allowing him to have limited movement in his fingers.The fork lift driver said: \"It happened and I had to live with it. But starting to get everything working again is great - it's a bonus.\"Morriston is one of the few places in the UK that can treat injuries to the brachial plexus - the network of nerves in the neck that control upper limb movement.Mr Boyce called it \"a very complex area of surgery\".",

Henrietta Rushwaya, once the federation chief executive, received a life ban for the second time for involvement in the attempted fixing.Rushwaya was banned for life after a previous match-fixing scandal, but that sanction was overturned.

It is impossible not to find the required number of qualified women from a billion people,\" he said.\"Firms think if a large number of companies do not follow the norm nobody will be fined and the deadline will be pushed ahead.\"Last month, International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde said the lack of female workers in India was a \"huge missed opportunity\" for the country's economic growth.India has a population of about 1.2 billion, but ranks 120th for female labour participation among the 131 nations surveyed by International Labour Organization in 2013.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

This stamp will celebrate and raise awareness of this iconic bridge which has not just physically connected two parts of the city but united our people.\"When the bridge was opened in 2011 we hoped it would be a catalyst for change. Now in 2015 the bridge symbolises a new chapter in our history and is viewed not just as a foot bridge but as a beacon of hope.\"The Peace Bridge belongs to everyone and through this initiative we can share it with the world.\"The other bridges featured on the stamps are: Tarr Steps (Exmoor); Row Bridge (Lake District); Pulteney Bridge (Bath); Thomas Telford's Craigellachie Bridge (Moray); Pont Grog y Borth / Menai Suspension Bridge; Robert Stephenson's High Level Bridge (Newcastle/Gateshead); Royal Border Bridge (Berwick-upon-Tweed); Tees Transporter Bridge (Middlesbrough); and the Humber Bridge.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

The authorities monitor media outlets, operate printing presses and lay down editorial policies.\"I will order proposals to be submitted for the establishment of private newspapers and magazines,\" Mr Berdymukhamedov said to officials, according to government paper Neutral Turkmenistan.He suggested that the Union of Private Industrialists and Entrepreneurs take a lead on the issue.It is unclear whether the move was restricted to business and trade publications.Turkmenistan is the largest gas producer in Central Asia.The country has made moves towards liberalisation since the death of its autocratic leader, Saparmurat Niyazov, in 2006.However opposition figures say it remains one of the most repressive and corrupt regimes in the world.Reporters without Borders said Turkmen authorities had refused to let a journalist travel to the Netherlands to seek medical treatment for a detached retina.\"The government's refusal to permit it seems to be an act of pointless and incomprehensible cruelty,\" the media watchdog said in a statement.Annamamed Myatiyev and his wife, also a reporter, had worked for Neutral Turkmenistan but had been fired.",

Some said they could not be bothered, while others were afraid of intimidation or embarrassed.A new guide to help students avoid being overcharged contains tips on how to take a meter reading, shopping around to get the best utility deals,  querying high bills and how to report faults, keep records of conversations and complain.Broadband packages are another minefield, says the guide, so students are advised to check the length of contracts, whether they are transferable, and to be aware of any limits on the amount of data they can download - even with so-called \"unlimited\" deals.To avoid losing deposits for damage caused by previous tenants, they are advised to check tenancy agreements and take inventories and photographs when they first move in.\"We want to ensure that all students are able to stand up for their rights and speak out when things go wrong, whether that is being asked to pay for a bill from a previous tenant or paying for damage they did not do,\" said Mr Shand Smith.\"Students should not be losing money, simply because they don't know their rights or are not making a fuss.\"",

I'm grateful to Max Richter for working with us on this great project.\"The broadcast will be available to listeners on BBC iPlayer for 30 days.",

His family were given Indian passports so that they could leave with him if they wished.His wife, an Indian citizen, was sick and did not accompany him.It is not clear if Mr Wang plans to return to India. He was never granted citizenship and was given a Chinese passport in 2013.Mr Wang says he was \"tasked with building roads for the Chinese army\" and was captured when he \"strayed erroneously\" into India's territory in January 1963.\"I had gone out of my camp for a stroll but lost my way. I was tired and hungry. I saw a Red Cross vehicle and asked them to help me. They handed me over to the Indian army,\" he said.He spent the next seven years in a number of different jails before a court ordered his release in 1969.Police took him to Tirodi, a far-flung village in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. He had not been allowed to leave the country since.Instead he worked at a flour mill, eventually marrying a local woman and raising a family. Neighbours said they lived in \"utter poverty\".",

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so.

It said the WAO had not raised concerns at that time.In February councillors agreed to accept the WAO findings but they have not withdrawn the indemnity provision.Announcing on Wednesday that she had lost her appeal, Mrs Thompson said she found the judgement against her a \"miscarriage of justice which I cannot accept but will have to live with\".In a statement via Carmarthenshire council, Mr James said: \"I am obviously pleased that Mrs Thompson's appeal was dismissed completely, and that the court agreed with the original judgement and views of the judge. They also awarded her to pay further costs for the appeal.\"Mrs Thompson has conducted a long-running campaign of harassment and defamation.\"It is time Mrs Thompson finally realised that she has done wrong, has been found by the High Court and Court of Appeal to have done wrong and cease her pointless campaign against the council and its officers.\"",

Injecting drug users are particularly vulnerable to this condition, given the unsanitary conditions and unsterile equipment associated with certain drug-use practices. The cases have raised alarm among medical professionals and prompted further investigation into the situation. Measures are being taken to identify the source of contamination and prevent any potential spread of the illness within the community. Dr. Rebecca Stevens, a leading expert in infectious diseases, emphasized the importance of seeking medical attention immediately if symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, or muscle weakness are observed. Health officials have urged the public, particularly those who engage in injecting drug use, to exercise caution and to prioritise harm reduction strategies. Awareness campaigns are underway to raise awareness of botulism, its symptoms, and the dangers associated with unhygienic drug-use practices. Authorities are also exploring ways to increase access to sterile equipment and harm reduction services for injecting drug users, with the aim of reducing the risk of botulism and other related infections among this vulnerable population. Early treatment can significantly improve the chances of a positive outcome and reduce the risk of complications for individuals affected by botulism.",

By bolstering the domestic industry, the government hopes to increase the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the national logistics sector.” As the new charges take effect, the UK government remains committed to working closely with its international partners to ensure a smooth transition and maintain good relations with the global haulage community.

Pannunzi, known as the “King of Cocaine” for his involvement in the international drug trade, had been on the run for years before he was tracked down. The arrest marks a significant victory in the ongoing fight against organized crime in Italy. Pannunzi’s criminal empire was primarily focused on the drug trade, particularly cocaine. The 71-year-old fugitive had managed to evade capture on numerous occasions, utilizing the complex network of criminal connections that the mafia provides. His arrest is expected to severely disrupt the flow of drugs into the country and deal a major blow to the mafia’s operations. Authorities believe that Pannunzi was responsible for arranging large-scale shipments of illicit substances from South America into Italy and other parts of Europe. The arrest of Roberto Pannunzi is seen as a major triumph in this ongoing battle, and sends a strong message that no criminal is beyond the reach of justice. Authorities hope that Pannunzi’s arrest will pave the way for further success in the fight against the mafia, and that the communities affected by organized crime will be able to regain some measure of peace and security.

The unfortunate incident transpired in the fourth over of England's pursuit when Morgan attempted to hook a short delivery from Mitchell Starc, resulting in a direct hit to the side of his helmet.Immediately following the impact, Morgan collapsed to the ground, prompting the England medical team to swiftly attend to him. After careful evaluation, they deemed it necessary to remove him from the field for further assessment. Subsequently, Dawid Malan replaced Morgan, contributing an impressive 34 not out to England's ultimate total of 261 for nine.Regrettably, England fell short by 24 runs, conceding a 3-0 series victory to Australia. Morgan's injury deals a significant blow to England's aspirations in the imminent Twenty20 World Cup, scheduled to commence in the United Arab Emirates on October 17.The 35-year-old skipper possesses a wealth of experience and accolades, having led England to victory in the esteemed 2019 Cricket World Cup. His absence would undoubtedly constitute a substantial setback for England, who are already grappling with the injuries of Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer.England now faces a critical decision: whether to risk Morgan's fitness for the T20 World Cup or prioritize rest to ensure his full recovery for the Ashes series against Australia, commencing on December 8. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will duly provide further updates regarding Morgan's condition.In the interim, England fervently hopes for their captain's swift and complete recovery, eagerly anticipating his availability for selection in the T20 World Cup.",

Club officials estimate repairs could cost thousands after motorbikes performed stunts that dug deep ruts and tore divots across the grass. \"Five of the course's eighteen holes were seriously impacted, with one green nearly destroyed by tire tracks gouged into the surface,\" said head groundskeeper Alan Smith, assessing the damage. Security camera footage is now being reviewed in hopes of identifying those responsible for the destructive weekend antics. Situated amongst the ancient woodlands that inspired the Robin Hood legends, the golf club is a local gem. However, the motorbike damage means play will be disrupted for several weeks while repairs like re-sodding and re-seeding worst affected areas are undertaken. Club captain Richard Clark called the acts \"thoughtless and selfish,\" worrying how the costly repairs may limit planned facility improvements. Temporary greens may need to be installed to keep the course open while damaged areas recover. With heavy rain forecast, groundskeeper Smith hopes machinery can access the muddy, rutted terrain to commence repairs before weather complicates the restoration work further. Nottinghamshire Police's investigation into the incident is ongoing, asking anyone with information to contact authorities.",

Recent research has shown that a tailored approach, taking into account an individual's unique genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, can lead to more effective and sustainable weight loss. The study found that individuals who received personalized recommendations experienced greater success in their weight loss journey compared to those who followed a standardized plan. This new approach could potentially revolutionize the way we address obesity, a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. By adopting a personalized approach, doctors can help their patients achieve their weight loss goals and improve their overall health.",

He also emphasized that the respect he and his fellow wheelchair tennis players are receiving from able-bodied tennis players is a result of their hard work and dedication to the sport, as well as the growing awareness of the importance of inclusivity and diversity in tennis.\"I'm incredibly grateful to the tennis community for embracing wheelchair tennis and recognizing its value as a part of the sport,\" Reid said. \"There's still work to be done, but I'm optimistic about the future.\"Reid's remarks come as tennis authorities and organizations increasingly emphasize the importance of inclusivity and diversity in the sport. Earlier this year, the International Tennis Federation launched a new strategy aimed at increasing participation and exposure for wheelchair tennis, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion across all levels of the sport.As Reid prepares for the upcoming Australian Open, where he and Hewett will look to defend their doubles title, he expressed his excitement about the continued growth and recognition of wheelchair tennis.\"It's an exciting time for the sport, and I'm proud to be a part of it,\" Reid said. \"I'm looking forward to seeing how far we can take wheelchair tennis in the years to come.\"",

This victory marks Federer's 10th consecutive win against the 22-year-old Zverev, and his 12th victory in Rome, where he has won the title a record four times.

With this win, Federer has now reached the final of the Italian Open for the 15th time in his career, solidifying his position as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Despite Zverev's impressive performance, Federer's superior experience and skill allowed him to outmaneuver his opponent throughout the match. Federer's strong serve and consistent groundstrokes proved too much for Zverev, who was unable to convert any of his five break point opportunities.

Conducted by researchers from the University of the West of England, the study aims to explore the enduring impact of these iconic structures on seaside communities and their continued relevance in the present day.Boasting picturesque views and charming architecture, Clevedon Pier has long been a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. However, its cultural and historical value extends far beyond its aesthetic appeal, according to Dr. Lucy Mellor, lead researcher on the project.\"Victorian seaside piers like Clevedon's were built during a time of rapid social change and played a significant role in the development of seaside towns,\" Mellor said. \"Our study seeks to understand how these piers have evolved over time and how they continue to shape local communities.\"To gather a range of perspectives on the pier's cultural significance, the research team is conducting interviews with residents, business owners, and visitors. They are also analyzing historical documents and photographs to paint a comprehensive picture of the pier's past and present.The study's findings will contribute to a larger conversation about the role of cultural heritage in modern society, Mellor noted. \"Our aim is to shed light on the ways in which Victorian seaside piers like Clevedon's continue to inform the identity of seaside towns and shape their development for the future.\"The study is expected to be completed by summer 2023, with the findings published in a leading cultural studies journal.

All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \" I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry. I really am. \" I turned and resumed walking away. Just before he was out of earshot, I glanced at him. \" So am I. \"",

In mere hours, we will see ICBMs cascade from the sky like fallen angels cast from Heaven; once our silent protectors in the form of mutually assured destruction, now our doomsday much like the betrayal of the rebel angel Lucifer. Tonight, we will see explosions glimmer through the land like shooting stars. Tonight, we will see our families evaporate into smoke before our very eyes. Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life. Still, we stand strong in the face of complete and assured death, not because we are too weak to retaliate, but because we' re strong enough not to. Our chapter is at its end. The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end. Are we really so vain to believe that just because a nation dies, all of mankind must perish? Are we really so arrogant to trust in our ideal of equality that the whole world must die? We' ve made our answers clear to the world. We hope it resonates and echoes in a new era so that mankind may truly understand what the end of the world mean and consequences it carries, so that some day in the future, despots and maniacs may not threaten nuclear war with a mad grin, but with a solemn attitude of remembrance. Perhaps one day, we can see how childish we really were. Thank you and goodnight.",

He does n' t have the sharp incisors required to tear human flesh from the bone. That kind of sharpness does n' t come easy. I spent months filing my teeth down with a nail file.

I understand that I probably have been eating out a bit too often and the local authorities need someone to pin the crimes on, but how do they even know a crime existed?

The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh. Blood pooled, like a stagnant well. But it smelled of power, and it fascinated me. I sat for a while, watching my work. Seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird. The beast' s eyes rolled in its head, endlessly. And I watched. Its death was of no great interest to me. The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did. When it was over I cleaned my tools, even then I had been tidy, systematic. The body I hid, deep in the woods. I visited it often, reminiscing, remembering.

I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

He landed directly in front of me. \" That was amazing sir, \" I said and put out my hand for a shake, \" Dr. Deletes the name, I wipe crime. \" The man looked at me puzzled.

It was by sheer chance that I saw him on the red rails of the bridge as I was patrolling through, I stopped abruptly, threw my lights on and I approached the man. White male, age roughly 30 years old. I approached him, and called, \" Sir, I' m here to help! \" He was a few feet away. He was dressed in black rags, his head scraped, and smelled like death. It was entirely unusual to see someone in this physical condition as bad as him. Rotting flesh- that' s the smell. I called out to him as traffic zoomed by, just missing my squad car, \" Sir, my name is Officer Heart! \" He replied, \" I know. \" His head still peering into the white abyss below. He turned to me, we locked eyes, and he said, \" I know who you are Heart. \" I was looking into my blue eyes, I observed the scar on his face - it was in the precise location where I got mine. His eyes were far more piercing than my own - they peered deeply into my soul. He said, \" I' ve been waiting for you. \" My hands felt ice cold - my hat flew off- the wind rushed through my hair - and i felt weightless. I struggled to breathe. Than I realized I was falling and right before impact - I realized - I was the jumper.",

I believe I' m getting mad with this isolation. Master says will meet with me in 14th Sept. 07th Sept Year 7AD - The Master is my imagination, at least I suppose it. Master send me an email to buy some alcoholic drinks and tuna cans. 09 th Sept Year 7AD - Master says he' s arriving.

I did n' t received more emails from the master. I did n' t get drunk in the last days. 12th Sept Year 7AD - Nothing happened. 13th Sept Year 7AD - I woke up today with a feeling that there was someone close to me. But only silence. Of course it' s impossible to have more people in the Earth, I' m the only surviver after the Doom, the big nuclear accident 7 years ago. I know it because I was the one that pulsed the red button. 14th Sept Year 7AD - I do n' t believe what' s happening but for the first time after doom I see another human like me.

Reality is all that I know. I have walked from shore to shore, and swam from beach to beach.

It was all much quieter than I expected. When we finally reached the city there was nothing to see except ruins, and they all look the same. The cities identity was gone. After a little while the debris was too much to drive through and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I always kept my rifle ready even when the others slung theirs over their backs. I was scared of ambushes. During training, we' d been told to stay aware. But I never figured out what I was meant to be aware of. If they shot me then that would be that. I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting? My father said it was about honor. About quelling the invaders, but I never believed that it was so simple. I wondered if they ever made it back to their home country, and if I would make it back to my home.",

I stand up and jump down onto the bridge. We make eye contact and he starts running back. The first time I saw him, he at least had the courage to face me. I charge at him. He runs to the second tower and I swing my giant maul at him, but miss as he climbs up the ladder. I can hear him killing 2 skeletons upstairs. Then he looks down and I look up. Our eyes meet once more. I AM ANGRY. Why? This is the part where he throws a fire bomb at my arms when I try to climb up on top. I jump. My fingers grab the edge. Boom, he burns them. But this does n' t stop me. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he' s always a real asshole. He ca n' t fight me fair, so what he does is always throws 5 stabs at me during the brief moment where I take my breath after landing. Until I blow him away with my maul. He runs to a stain of blood and picks it up. Retrieval. Now he ca n' t even land a hit, the whimpy little fucker that he is. All he does is jump around and block with his shield. But he ca n' t keep it up forever. The moment he exhausts himself, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain of what he once was. I jump down the tower and go back to mine. I lay down and watch the skies. I savor the moment of peace. But I know from experience that fucker will be back in 10 minutes to interrupt it.

A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar.

The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain. He quickly dozed off. -- - In the middle of a pleasant dream about dogs made of butter, Michigan awoke with a start.

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

Light wavered at the center of my vision, distorting my perception of the blue hospital bed fabric. Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall.

As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes. I stepped into the bridge and was silently greeted by my ship mate, Sebastian. He was a quiet man. But that was all part of the business. I sat down on my chair and gazed up again. More crystal clear glass met my gaze, as well as a star ship that hovered just outside it. We were close now. Very close. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to steady my breathing. This was it. My final job. As I reopened them, I took a look at the control panel sitting in front of me now. All engines were running. The ship was still activated. There were no power failures. Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time. I took one more deep breath, and began to speak. \" Sebastian. Lower the cloak. Fire the EMP. \"",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated. Maybe something like \" What the fuck is wrong with you? \" *",

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

That was going to be difficult however, I did n' t know how to make steel for one. I was going to have to hope I came across a textbook in one of these ruined buildings that would help me. The last university I found had it' s entire library destroyed and even after searching for three weeks I had found nothing useful for construction, only biology and microbiology textbooks had survived. I had time though. About another twenty million years before the sun exploded. I could probably make a spaceship in that time.",

Upon that relic I found the giver of life, crone of death herself, and goddess of magic Isis. Using the relic I wished for immortal life for my soul mate and myself. The tricky thing about magic is that you have to be precise. It' s been hundreds of years ago since I found that relic, and have been through relationships like paper dolls. They never last and I have yet to find my soulmate despite traveling and drifting through out the world. Enjoying the evolution of society, and feeling sorrow for the down falls of some. I am now traveling through Beijing and a strange, handsome man has now been trailing me for the past few blocks, I have now worries as he follows me for I know things he probably would never think a woman of my frame and stature capable of doing. Now to lead him some where secluded and see his intent. Turning down an alley off the busy, buzzing street, I wait. He pauses before cautiously traveling down to where I stand. I can see though his features are somewhat shadowed that he is fair looking, with a strong jawline, and cute by my standards. I can tell that he is a bit timid to come any closer. Not sure if he will understand me I call out in my native tounge, \" Why have you been following me? What do you want? \" In a deep vibrating, velvety, yet soft, voice he says \" I felt you long before I saw you. \" I could sense the truth in his words. For I too felt him, before I saw him following me. \" What is your name? And how old are you? \" He inched closer into the light, my heart caught in my chest, and he paused, possibly feeling my anxiousness. \" I mean no harm, and now that I see you I can tell our fates are one. Names are meaningless, I am sure you have also traded yours many times as well. \"",

One day, the little boy did not come to play, saddening the great tree. Though, the next day, the boy did come! The tree was happy! Eventually, the boy' s visits grew less frequent and shorter. Then the boy stopped coming altogether. The tree felt dejected and hurt for it was great and definitely the largest there ever was. What was wrong? Does the boy hate me? Did he not actually enjoy playing with me? I thought he loved me. Years had passed and the boy finally returned. The tree greeted the boy and the boy returned the greeting. Then he asked for money. Money? The tree might as well give the boy all his apples it grew itself. So the tree gave the boy its apples... then its branches... then its trunk...

I approached her slowly, casually, as though my path were eternal and without exigency. There was no seduction in my heart, though I will now admit my flushed cheeks betrayed my trepidation - I was simply a farmer, reaping his harvest as he always did. I passed her with only a slight glance, the same look I would give any singular, sanguine beauty in a field of yellow wash.

As I came close, the noonday sun struck her rosy visage and she glowed with a dancing sparkle of crimson flame. Mesmerized yet undaunted, I reached down and picked her up. Her skin was flawless. The smooth, sensuous symmetry set my heart alight with passion. My entire being, my very soul felt as if it had expanded beyond its narrow confines. I was free. I was alive. I was *home*.

When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white. Suddenly, the CEO was transfixed on Jack' s hands. Inside the CEO' s mind was pure madness. He saw his wife and kids burning, in the ruins of his childhood home. He could n' t hold back his tears. One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse.

Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor. A small victory for life, if it ever truly fought death. But a huge victory for me, in my own role in humanity' s fight against death.",

But we had nothing that was useful against a 5km wide asteroid, and certainly nothing that could have been deployed in three days. After all, even if I had warned the president, warned the people of the Earth, what help would it have done? No, it was better for the people to be snuffed out suddenly, rather than have the human race descend into an orgy of rape and looting in its final days. I made the choice for the benefit of mankind. As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA. My hope is that one day an intelligent civilization will recover one of those probes, discover our accomplishments, and return the human race to life. Until then, farewell.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony. It is our duty to the planet that bore our kind to be not only the last of humanity, but the best of humanity.

If I wanted ice cream I' d just have to say the words and poof, there' s the ice cream. But the thing is, I was n' t the only one with this ability. My whole family had it, and it made for a quite a few great stories. Let me tell you a funny story about the time my brother and I got into an argument over who gets to player 1 on the Nintendo 64. So, or started like any normal day would. My brother and I, both 8 but not twins, get up, eat breakfast, go to school, use our powers to cheat our way through it and come home. But once we came home our mother would have us do our homework and then let us go have fun. So we went and quickly did our homework then we rushed over to the TV and grabbed the player one controller for the Nintendo 64. \" I want to be player one, \" my brother said making the controller appear in his hands. \" No! I' m player one, \" I said ripping the controller from his hands. We hit a bit of a dilemma. Anything we said happened, so it was a matter of who gave up first. Now we argued for a few hours on who is going to me player one, until finally my mother came in the room and said, \" why do n' t you both be player one? You know it can work. Everything we say works, I do n' t know how, but you get the idea. \" \" Oh yeah, thanks mom, \" my brother and I said as we both become player one for our favorite game. My brother and I were n' t very smart people. *please excuse all spelling mistakes. I wrote it on my phone on the train during rush hour. ( Mbta ) *",

AIPAC went into full gear when President Paul' s budget did not include aid to Israel, but the President held his ground and a majority of Congress cooperated.

It was large and bulky, and camouflaged with a dark green tint. If that were me up there, I definitely would have had trouble holding that thing. Larry tapped my shoulder and held up three fingers. One finger fell, and we clung against the brick wall behind us, removing our shoes to reduce the amount of noise we would make. Two fingers down, and Larry and I removed our shirts to help with the temperature. Three fingers gone, and we ran. As Larry ran ahead of me, the sound of a whistle pierced my ear. Then the guard' s deep voice. \" You! Stop! \" And then they fired. Larry, being the bigger of us, was hit first. He knelt down and told me to keep running, so I did. There was no time to lose. It was now or never. Due to my agile build and quick maneuverability, the guards kept missing their shots. They reloaded their guns but by then I had neared the edge of the water.

So you do n' t want to know how I learned how all the sexiest chicks were from the past. Fair enough. You felt that your education was boring and so you had to inflict your exhaustion on me. Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, a warm Spring breeze belied the shuddering forces soon to be unleashed... Eyes fixed on his hapless target, the elderly man prepared to explosively transform the potential to the kinetic. In his long fingers he rolled a hard, unyielding baseball. Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

His fingers hit the keys, and with the silence of each movement the specters of the crowd sit in awe. Eyes closed the faded sound clings to the inner most reaches of his mind. In its beauty he wanders. The asbestos lined walls are cracked and weathered. The ornamental roof cracked and rotted allowing the moon to light the room. The concert hall a relic of the past; an inescapable acknowledgement of something once lost. Verbal communication caused the most hardship. Businesses temporarily came to standstill, but the internet soon accounted for most of, if not all interaction. Sign language was universally adopted, and within its nuances, the beauty of language once again emerged. The world had moved on, but the inescapable human tendency towards music left an unfillable void. So here he sat, a relic of the past, clinging on to something long forgotten. But this was home. He sat playing for his idols. Chopin, Bach, Stravinsky all sat in the root laden seats cheering on their last remnants of immortality. As his fingers danced on the keys all that remained was history. All that remained was the knowledge of a beauty that deserved to be preserved.",

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

Are you with us. \"I stammered, \"I think, I think… \"I couldn' t form a cogent sentence. 12 years of memories, and close to a life time of belief began to dissolve into whatever substance such things are composed of. \"I think, I need you to prove to me that what you are saying is true. I can not go down this path. I won' t abandon a lifetime of education on the basis of your words. I must see proof! \"\"I chose you because you' re an empiricist Felix! \"Dr. Sumner exclaimed. \"The proof you need is in your very own body, but I can make it easier for you to understand. Look through this lens at your left hand. \"I held the strange green monocle to my right eye, and looked down towards my left hand. All of a sudden I saw what seemed to be another universe. Multiple clusters of galaxies swirled where moments before my pasty left hand rested in the cold air of the lab. The vastness of what I saw gave me vertigo, and I fell backward onto cement flooring. \"What did I just see Dr. Sumner? Is that where they live? Can someone peer into our universe the same way I just looked into there' s? \"Doctor Sumner paused and then nodded, \"Young man, we do not understand the depth of this system, nor can we determine its outer limits. We have communicated with entities that reside within many humans and animals. Our instruments have determined that these entities live within the protein coating of hostile cells we commonly refer to as viruses. It would seem we are no different. Our existence may portend the death of the host we call the universe; just as the existence of these communications reveal that countless smaller life forms work towards the death of us all. \"",

He flushed the toilet during the Memorial service, as we were all in the gymnasium listening to our principal speak. He went and laid some cable, pinched a load, sat on the porcelain throne. *Call it what you will*. He took a large one. Course, he forgot that he did it during maintenance time, so naturally, the toilet got clogged. Then overflowed. Of course no one noticed since the janitors always take their smoke break early. So, only after the service did anyone notice. It also happened to be the day our mayor decided to come by and inspect the school. Of course it was a disappointing mess, so he went home smelling of turds and bleach. I guess if there is anything obvious about small rural towns, it' s that they will only have one school, and more often than not, one set of bars and a stripper club. That used the same brand of bleach. And smelled of turds. So, in all honesty, when we heard that the mayor had been shot by his wife because she allegedly claimed that he had been at the stripper club that smelt of turds and bleach, we all knew who had caused it. *Fucking Winston. *",

I look around once I finally begin to get my bearings. I look around and immediately am drawn to the large man - larger than one might expect in life, but given this is the afterlife, a ten foot tall man should be expected - grinning at me over his cup. Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking. Finally I get my sorts together to actually look at more of the room. There are many people laughing and dancing and singing and altogether ignoring me. The walls are adorned with paintings and some of the space filled with sculptures, all of which are a feast for the eyes. I have n' t even taken a step since I opened the door and I am completely stunned by what I see. I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all. The deserts have no seeming order to them, I see tarts here, cakes there, pudding everywhere.

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and.... Well you see, *world cup* may mean different thing for different people. since I had no interest in football ( some guys call it saucer? ) I thought I would write on cricket World cup. P.

Overflowing with anticipation, I took my first step out of the lunar module and onto the lunar surface, only to be seized by profound astonishment. Before me, firmly planted in the lunar soil, stood a flag from an ancient society that had perished centuries ago. Its design, though archaic, portrayed a nation that had long ceased to exist. Yet, what confounded me even further was the presence of modern lunar equipment scattered about, bearing the insignia of that same forgotten society. How was this possible? It seemed as if a portal had materialized, linking our present with their distant past.With meticulous examination, I endeavored to unravel the enigma presented by these artifacts. Could it be conceivable that time had inexplicably folded upon itself, merging disparate eras into a singular nexus? The potential ramifications were nothing short of monumental. Might the past possess the power to influence the future in ways yet unimagined? Perhaps, within these relics, lay a collective memory that connected us to epochs long vanished.Surrounded by the echoes of centuries past, the weight of realization settled upon me. This remarkable discovery would undoubtedly ignite a revolution in our comprehension of time, history, and the evolution of civilizations.",

Overwhelmed by the abundance of unfamiliar flora and fauna, they faced a daunting challenge: to discern what was edible. With cautious steps, they approached plants, delicately breaking twigs and dissecting leaves, testing each one upon their tongues. Often, their efforts proved fruitless as they spat out bitter morsels or succumbed to stomach-churning pains. Undeterred by setbacks, they persisted tenaciously, firm in their belief that knowledge awaited them, concealed within nature's enigmatic bounty. They keenly observed the animals around them, mimicking their grazing patterns and sampling what they feasted upon. The humans fostered a profound connection with the land, recognizing that it held the secrets to their survival. Generation after generation, they diligently transmitted their findings, bequeathing the wisdom of distinguishing between nourishment and poison. Gradually, the \"First\" humans compiled a comprehensive catalog of edibles, honing the ability to differentiate sustenance from detriment. Thus, fueled by their resilient hunger and insatiable curiosity, they embarked on the journey towards mastering sustenance and unraveling the mysteries of the natural world.",

I shielded my eyes from the dazzling sunlight and squinted, allowing my vision to adjust to the new reality outside. With my heart pounding in my chest, I cautiously set foot on the scarred landscape before me.Once a thriving city, now reduced to nothing more than ruins and ashes. Crumbled buildings stretched their skeletal remains towards the sky, resembling desperate hands seeking salvation. Debris, shattered glass, and twisted metal cluttered the streets, creating a scene of utter desolation.As I ventured further, a wave of sadness engulfed me. Memories of laughter, bustling crowds, and vibrant colors flooded my mind, a stark contrast to the lifeless gray wasteland that now surrounded me. Tears welled up in my eyes, but I blinked them away, determined to find a glimmer of hope amidst the destruction.Even nature had not been spared from the wrath of the blast. Uprooted trees stood bare and stripped of their foliage, leaving behind a barren and forsaken landscape. Once pristine parks now emanated a bleak and haunting aura, void of any signs of life. The gentle breeze whispered through the skeletal branches, carrying with it a melancholic melody.In the distance, I caught sight of a solitary figure. A flicker of hope ignited within me, causing my heart to leap. As I approached, I realized that this figure was another survivor, perhaps feeling as lost and bewildered as I was. Sorrow etched his face, yet there was a glimmer of resilience in his eyes.Our gazes met, silently acknowledging the shared experience and the arduous journey that lay ahead. Without exchanging words, we walked side by side, leaving imprints of our footsteps on the desolate ground. The unspoken silence between us spoke volumes, bridging the gap of solitude and offering solace.Together, we ventured through the ruins, scavenging for fragments of the world we once knew.",

The rush of adrenaline, which had fueled my every move during the harrowing encounter with the trio of intruders, now rapidly dissipated, leaving behind weariness and an overwhelming sense of disquiet. Gasping for precious breaths, my gaze shifted towards the television nestled in the corner, its screen ablaze with an array of breaking news updates. The anchor's voice trembled in sync with the earth-shattering information relayed—an extremist faction had unleashed a potent hallucinogenic substance into the veins of the city's air supply. Panic surged through my veins as the implications of their sinister actions dawned upon me. Thoughts raced through my mind, attempting to assimilate the malevolence that had woven its tendrils into the fabric of reality. The world surrounding me seemed to twist and contort, blending seamlessly with the eerie images flickering on the screen. Faces morphed into macabre masks, and the walls appeared to pulsate with an ethereal, alien energy. Fear clawed its way into my being, yet amidst the chaotic symphony, an indomitable determination surged forth. Summoning every ounce of strength, I staggered to my feet, defying the disorienting effects of the hallucinogenic onslaught. Each unsteady step ushered me closer to the sanctuary enclosed by the confines of my front door—a fiercely desperate urge to secure refuge and shield those cherished ones propelling me forward. The world beyond materialized as a phantasmal kaleidoscope of horrors. The streets teemed with contorted figures, their movements grotesquely disjointed and erratic. Nevertheless, resolute in my resolve, I pressed on, resolutely ignoring the frightful visions that threatened to shatter my precarious grip on sanity.",

She had been given only months to live, and as she slipped in and out of consciousness, she reflected on her life and the choices that had brought her to this point. She thought of all the things she had never done, all the dreams she would never realize. As her breathing grew more labored, she closed her eyes and let the darkness consume her. She felt a deep sense of regret and despair, knowing that her life was ending before it had really begun. But as her life ebbed away, she wondered if there was more to existence than what she had experienced. Did her soul live on, or was this the end? In that moment, she felt a strange sense of peace, knowing that her suffering would soon be over. She wondered if she would ever find the answers to these questions. Her death was a reminder that life is fragile and precious, and that we should never take it for granted. And so, with a final sigh, she took her last breath and passed away, leaving behind a legacy of pain and sorrow for those who loved her. The story of the girl is a cautionary tale about the importance of living a full and meaningful life. We should live each day to the fullest and make the most of every moment, for we never know when our time will come. Her story is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. We should never give up on ourselves or our dreams, no matter how difficult things may seem. We should strive to make a difference in the world and leave a positive legacy for those around us. The girl’s story is a powerful reminder that life is a gift and that we should cherish it. We should always believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that better days are ahead.",

He appeared in visions to scientists and innovators, giving them subtle hints about new theories and technology.

Janice decides that she needs to be responsible and find a way, even if this is dangerous, it needs to get rid of this compressive system. After a lot of consideration, she realized that the only way was to play her death, making her look like an accident so that she could disappear without being alert by the authorities.

However, I never desired a life confined by the responsibilities of leadership and politics. When my father announced his intention to name me as his heir at my 18th birthday celebration, I could stay silent no longer. I told him clearly that I did not want the duties or pressures that came with being Duke. My father was furious and refused to believe I would reject such an opportunity.Arguments grew heated as he tried relentlessly to change my mind, listing all the privileges and honor that would come with the title. However, I stood firm in my refusal, insisting that I wanted a life of adventure unburdened by obligations to the duchy and people. My defiant stance caused a rift in our relationship.In the following months, my father barely spoke to me, hoping my resolve would weaken under his cold treatment. But my mind was made up, and nothing would sway me from my choice. Without an heir, his advisers pressed him to name my younger brother as the new heir instead.Reluctantly, my father agreed, but remained bitterly disappointed in me. I packed my bags, bid farewell to my family, and left our estate to seek my fortune elsewhere. Now, free from responsibilities, I have spent the past year traveling the world on daring expeditions.  For the first time in my life, I answer to no one and live fully on my own terms.

Dreading the answer, I asked \"Which one?\" \"Lust,\" he replied coldly. \"She's become lazy.\"He explained my new role as Lust would be to tempt humans with supernatural powers of attraction and seduction. On Earth once more, I set about my task. Humans fell before me with little effort - a smile here, a caress there.  Yet manipulating people left an unpleasant feeling. Was an eternity of this what I wanted? With each conquest, my doubts grew stronger. After weeks, I returned to Lucifer for review. To my shock, he praised my success outperforming the last Lust.But I had changed my mind. Telling Lucifer manipulating humans against their will was unethical, his expression darkened in fury. \"You dare defy me?\" he bellowed, eyes burning red. I stood firm, insisting my work was done.  With a roar, Lucifer grabbed me by the throat in anger. Through sheer willpower, I broke free. We faced off, his power against my growing resolve. Then surprisingly, he threw back his head and laughed. \"You've got spirit, I'll give you that,\" Lucifer admitted begrudgingly. \"Very well, you're free to go. But my offer to replace Greed remains open, should you reconsider.\" I wasted no time leaving that dark place behind, though still bearing the imprint of serving one of Hell's rulers.",

One summer day, while adventuring in the woods, I stumbled upon an ancient underground temple hidden among the mossy stones. Intrigued, I slowly descended the worn stone steps, enveloped by the flickering light of torches lining the walls. I gazed in wonder at the enormous pillared rooms filled with intricate carvings and mysterious hieroglyphs covering every surface. Though I tried, I could not decipher their meaning. As I peered into a shadowy alcove, my foot landed upon a hidden pressure plate with a dull click. Suddenly, the temple began to rumble as long-dormant traps sprang to life all around me.Dart launchers fired from the walls and spears shot out of the darkness. I dashed through a deadly gauntlet, narrowly dodging each flying blade and arrow. Deep within the temple, I discovered a large room filled with treasures glittering in the torchlight - piles of gold coins and sparkling jewels. My curiosity got the best of me, and as I grabbed a handful, the stone floor gave way beneath my feet. I plunged into an inky black pool below and thought for sure I would drown. But somehow, I surfaced in a sunny oasis miles from the forest, exhausted but alive. When I stumbled home and recounted my strange adventure, no one believed my fantastic tale. To this day, I am still not certain what truly happened in that underground temple so long ago deep in the forest behind my house.",

A new diversion was needed to appease the stormy-hearted lord of the skies.

Among the verdant hills of Arcadia, a beautiful nymph named Europa caught his weathered eye. \"Come with me,\" said the handsome traveler, extending a calloused hand in offer. Europa accepted, unaware of the divine power before her earthly eyes. Their passionate love affair played out for many blissful nights under the stars.

Within hours, additional townspeople transformed.The military deployed but coordinating a response proved challenging due to the zombies' erratic wandering. They shuffled through streets, occasionally grabbing at passersby. However, it became clear the zombies lacked real coordination or higher thinking. They drifted aimlessly and could barely manage consuming the occasional victim.After merely a day, most zombies simply collapsed in roads or fields, losing interest once surface hunger passed. Possessing no communication or cooperative threats, they posed small danger alone.Remaining inhabitants easily avoided the shambling corpses or singly overpowered threats as needed. By night's end, zombies had fallen motionless from depletion.An autopsy on one revealed death by starvation as it failed to effectively scavenge or hunt alone.

Its roar shook the ruins of the fallen castle. With speed and precision, Claudia notched an arrow and took aim at the wizard as his spell began to form. In one fluid motion, she let the arrow fly just as the dragon opened its maw, unleashing a jet of flame.Her arrow found its mark, but the wizard's spell was already loosed. The lightning erupted from his staff and crashed into the dragon's fiery breath, creating a massive explosion. The force threw Claudia from the tower with such might that it knocked the wind from her lungs. Below, the king's soldiers fought desperately against the undead horde swarming the battlefield. Through the ringing in her ears, she heard the dragon crash amongst them. Its massive weight crushed armor and bone alike under its fallen form. She struggled to pull herself up on shaking arms. Across the battlefield, the lich lord laughed ominously at the carnage, his skeletal minions overwhelming the few survivors one by one.With immense effort of will, Claudia pushed past the pain and crawled to the tower's edge. The fallen wizard's staff lay amongst the rubble below, its gems still flickering with untapped power. If she could reach it, perhaps the tide could be turned. She took a deep breath and leapt into the fray.  Her fingers closed around the staff just as the lich lord sensed her presence. He turned his gaze upon her fallen form with a look of grim triumph in his cold, dead eyes. Claudia met his stare with steely resolve and grasped the staff, unleashing its fury upon the necromancer in a last, desperate bid to save her kingdom.",

They had been sent from their home star system, far beyond our own, to monitor and record the development of intelligent life on Earth. Now they were preparing their final report and recommendations for the Council of Preserve. In their report, the moderators cited humanity’s capacity for both good and evil. They noted humanity’s incredible technological achievements, but also its propensity for conflict and destruction. They had watched humanity evolve from hunter-gatherers to world powers. They had seen humanity at its worst and at its best. They had witnessed countless wars, famines, and plagues that had ravaged human populations throughout history. They concluded that humanity was a flawed and fragile species, but also one with great potential. After much deliberation, the moderators came to a consensus. They recommended that the Council of Preserve consider allowing humanity to prove itself. The moderators proposed a series of tests to determine humanity’s ability to live in peace with other intelligent species. They believed that if humanity could pass these tests, it would be worthy of joining the intergalactic community. The Council of Preserve reviewed the moderators’ report and recommendations and decided to proceed with the tests. The first test was a simple one. Humanity would be allowed to establish peaceful contact with a nearby alien species.",

It is important to recognize that police officers have a difficult job and often put their lives on the line to protect and serve their communities. Instead, I would like to focus on promoting positive and respectful interactions between law enforcement and the communities they serve. A good police officer understands the importance of de-escalation and treats every situation with respect and professionalism. They take the time to listen to people’s concerns and work to build trust within the community. However, it is also important to acknowledge that police brutality and excessive force are unacceptable and can have devastating consequences. A good police officer recognizes the value of human life and the importance of using force only when absolutely necessary. They understand that their role is not to oppress or harm, but to protect and serve their communities with compassion and respect. In summary, a good police officer’s view of an unnecessary police killing is one that recognizes the value of human life and the importance of using force only when absolutely necessary.",

Then she stumbled on a small, quaint antique shop in a corner of the city. She spent hours browsing the shelves, picking up each object and examining it carefully. The shop was filled with all kinds of unusual and unique objects, and Sarah knew she had found the right place. Finally she found it, a beautiful, delicate music box with delicate carvings and a soft, melodious tune. She bought it and wrapped it carefully, eager to see her mother's face light up with joy. When she arrived at her mother's house, she was greeted with a warm hug and a smile. Sarah handed her the music box, and her mother carefully unwrapped it, her eyes widening with delight. “It's beautiful,” she said, tears welling up in her eyes. Together they wound up the music box and listened to the soft, melodious tune, a moment of pure joy and connection. Sarah beamed with pride, happy to have found the perfect present for her mother. And she knew that her mother would treasure the music box forever, a symbol of their love and closeness. As they sat there, Sarah realized that sometimes the best gifts come from the heart, not from the price tag.",

As I was sneaking around a medieval town, climbing buildings, and killing guards, Sarah suddenly looked at me with a strange expression. “You’re not just playing the game, you’re actually becoming the character!” I was taken aback by her words, but when I looked down at my hands, I realized they were no longer mine. They were the hands of Altair, the game’s main character. “How is this possible?” I asked, trying to sound calm despite my confusion. “I don’t know, but it’s pretty cool!” Sarah shook her head in amazement. As I continued to play, I noticed that my movements were becoming more fluid and graceful, just like Altair’s. I could climb walls, jump from rooftop to rooftop, and even wield a sword with ease. “You’re like a real-life Assassin!” Sarah exclaimed. We spent the rest of the afternoon playing game after game, and each time I absorbed the abilities and skills of the character I was playing. I was a master of World of Warcraft, a pro at Overwatch, and even a virtuoso at Dance Dance Revolution. But as the day wore on, I began to realize that this power had a price. I was no longer just a college student, I was a vessel for the characters I played. Over the next few days, Sarah and I continued to explore the limits of my new abilities. But as I lay in bed that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was losing myself to the virtual world. I was becoming someone else, and I was becoming more and more afraid.",

It was a woman, a former colleague of mine. She sat down opposite me and began to explain. ‘Jack wasn’t who you thought he was,’ she said. ‘He was an undercover agent, working to bring down a criminal organization. You were just a pawn in their game.’ I was stunned. I had been duped. But I had faked my own death. How could they have known? ‘They found out about your plan,’ the woman explained. ‘They knew you were going to fake your own death, so they set a trap for you.’ I couldn’t believe it.

My family and friends were overjoyed for me, but little did they know that this moment of triumph would be a moment of tragedy for someone close to me. She had always been there for me, through thick and thin, but now she seemed to be hiding something. She had hoped to study medicine, like me, but now her dreams were shattered. It was only days later that she confessed to me that she had also applied to the same university, but had been rejected. I tried to comfort her, but she was inconsolable. I felt guilty and ashamed of my success, knowing that it had come at the expense of my friend’s failure. Over the next few weeks, Sarah became more and more withdrawn and isolated. She stopped going to social gatherings and stopped answering my calls and messages. I didn’t understand why she was behaving this way, but I knew I had to do something to help her. I tried everything I could to reach out to her, but she seemed to be pushing me away. One day, I decided to go to her house and confront her. She told me she was sorry, that she was just feeling so depressed and didn’t know how to cope. I found her in her room, staring blankly at the wall. I told her that I was there for her, no matter what, and that we would get through this together. I listened to her and I understood. I knew I couldn’t take away her pain, but I could be there for her. I listened to her and I supported her, and eventually she began to heal. Slowly but surely, Sarah began to open up to me again. She started coming to social gatherings and started talking to me about her feelings. It wasn’t easy, but we both learned a valuable lesson.",

As the man’s cries died down, she turned and walked away, leaving his lifeless body behind. In the distance, she saw the ruins of a city, its once-grand buildings reduced to rubble. She knew she would have to rebuild it, but for now she was content to revel in the satisfaction of her revenge. She walked toward the city, her footsteps echoing in the stillness. She knew that she was a monster, but she had done what she had to do to survive. In a world as cruel as this, that was all that mattered.",

My father was a diplomat, and his ability to speak the truth and bring about peace was unparalleled. My grandfather, on the other hand, was a brilliant scientist.

I have worked tirelessly as a lawyer to ensure that those who have been wronged are compensated and that the guilty are brought to justice. My father was a key player in resolving some of the world’s most complex conflicts. My infallibility has not been limited to my professional life. In my personal relationships, I have always been truthful and transparent. My friends and family know that they can count on me to tell them the truth, even if it is not what they want to hear. I remember one of my most memorable cases: I was working as a financial advisor when I noticed some suspicious activity. I conducted a thorough investigation and gathered evidence that proved the company’s chief executive had been embezzling funds. My findings led to the arrest of the chief executive and the return of millions of dollars to the investors who had been defrauded. Another memorable case was when I discovered a hidden underground cave system. I was hiking in the mountains when I stumbled upon a hidden entrance to a cave that was concealed by a thick layer of vegetation.",

Evil takes many forms, from the horrors of the real world to the terrors of our imagination. Evil once loomed over a small town in the heart of America. A young girl named Emily had always been fascinated by the supernatural and the macabre, and she spent her days exploring abandoned houses and overgrown cemeteries, searching for signs of the paranormal. As she wandered through the crumbling streets of the old part of town, she came across a mysterious object—a book bound in human skin, adorned with strange symbols that seemed to move and writhe like living things. She knew she had to have it, no matter what the cost. But one day, her fascination turned to obsession, and she delved too deeply into the darkness. In the days that followed, strange things began to happen. People disappeared, only to turn up dead, covered with the same twisted symbols that adorned the book. As soon as she touched the book, she felt a chill run down her spine, as if something malevolent had taken notice of her. One night, as she was absorbed in the book’s dark magic, she felt a presence watching her. She turned around and saw a figure standing in the shadows, its eyes blazing with an otherworldly light. Her friends and family grew worried, but she refused to listen to them, convinced that she had finally found the proof of the supernatural she had always sought. The figure moved closer, filling the room with an unspeakable evil. Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the figure vanished, leaving her alone and terrified. The next day, her parents came home to find her gone.",

I started browsing through the different categories, laughing at some of the ridiculous situations that the fans had come up with. Suddenly I stumbled upon a story that made my heart stop. It was about me. At first I thought it was just a normal fanfic, but as I started reading I realized that it was something completely different. The story portrayed me as a villain, someone who wanted to destroy the world. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. I tried to dismiss it, telling myself that it was just a silly story, but I couldn’t help feeling uneasy. How could anyone think that I would do such a thing? I felt a cold sweat trickle down my spine as I read on. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it only seemed to get worse. The story portrayed me as a monster, someone who took pleasure in the suffering of others. I couldn’t just sit there and let people think that I was a monster. How could anyone think that I was capable of such horrors? I knew that I had to do something, but I didn’t know what. I decided to try to find the person who had written the story. I scrolled through the author’s profile, trying to find any information that might lead me to them. Maybe they would listen to reason and take the story down. But it was all in vain. There was no way to contact them, no way to make them understand. I felt a wave of hopelessness wash over me. I knew that I wasn’t a monster, but how could I prove it to the world? How could I ever escape this horrible portrayal of myself? I felt as if I were trapped in a nightmare from which I couldn’t wake up. I knew that I would never be able to look at myself the same way again. I decided to try to forget about it, to pretend that it had never happened. But how could I forget about something that had shaken me to my core?",

The task is to write a short story in the future of the anti -Utopia, and human beings colonize other planets. The next hour, I spent the idea of brainstorming and outlined my story. I decided to set my story on a planet called Nova Haven, where humans have established a dim and oppressed colony. The protagonist is a young woman named Maya. She has always dreamed of escaping the earth and exploring the galaxy. She has worked as a technician on the large generator of the colonial site, which provides the only source of power for the settlement. One day, Maya found a hidden information in the code of the generator, which implied the existence of the secret spacecraft hidden deep in the crust. Determined to find the ship and escaped Nova Haven, Maya began to secretly formulate a plan. She knew that it was not easy because the colonies were severely protected and monitored by the government. The Maya collected materials and resources in the next few days, while avoiding the doubts of her colleagues and boss. She works unremittingly and often sacrifice sleep and dining to achieve her goals. In the end, the day when the Mayan was going to put her plan to practice. She secretly entered the generator room under the cover of the night and began to invade the system. When she worked, the generator began to fail, causing huge power outages in the entire colony. The Maya knew that it would create a opportunity window for her, letting her secretly cross the guard and find a hidden ship. Maya passed through the dark and deserted corridor of the colonies with a racing heart, avoiding patrol guards and avoiding safety drones.",

When she looked at the vast ocean, she couldn't help feeling a wonderful and awe. She wandered more and more, and the water became deeper and deeper until she was completely immersed in the hug of the ocean. Luna felt a sense of peace and freedom she had never had before, and she knew she would never forget this moment. She is no longer hindered by fear, and she knows that she is capable. When she swims to the shore, Luna is very grateful for the ocean and her power. She knew that she would never look at the sea in the same way. She would always cherish the memory of this night. That night she got rid of fear and embraced the unknown night.",

One day, I felt particularly frustrated and struggled in the feeling of insufficient and self -doubt. My grandmother has always been my biggest supporter. He put me aside and looked at me. She said, \"You know, child, you are a great person. You are kind, clever and talented. Don't forget.\" Her words resonated with me, making me realize that I have always focused on my shortcomings. Since that day, I have consciously strived to change my point of view and focus on my advantages. My grandmother's politeness made me pursue my dream confidently. Many years later, I found that I could help others and make sure that I would convey the information that I encouraged me with my grandmother. I told them that they are also great, and their potential is great. I hope they know that they are not alone, and they take root for them in their corners. When I looked at their eyes, I could see the same hope of my grandmother's burning hope for me a few years ago. This is a powerful moment, which reminds me of a single phrase that can have an impact on someone's life. My grandmother may no longer be with me, but her encouragement words will always be with me, inspiring me to give forward and spread enthusiasm in my own.",

They found a row of strange and glowing objects, not cash. They look like small metal spheres, seemingly pulse with extraordinary energy. The thief was confused and a little scared. What are these things? One of them was a towering person named Max, cautiously approached one of the spheres and touched it. The touch feels warm, and it seems to vibrate with strange power. Suddenly, Max made a painful cry, bumping backwards, holding his hand. \"Let me go?\" He shouted. \"It burned me!\" Other thieves gathered together, not sure what to do. They looked at each other nervously and wanted to know if they accidentally found some kind of trap. But later, one of them noticed something strange. The spheres began to become brighter, and they seemed to be pulited with each other. It seems that they are communicating with each other and even accusing some attacks. The thief knew that they had to leave there quickly. They grabbed the schoolbag and started running for it, but it was too late. The sphere began to emit blind light, and the thief was restrained in the beam. When the light faded, the thief found himself in a strange alien world. They stood on the barren rock plains, surrounded by towering glowing plants. They don't know how they return there, or how to go home. When they looked around, they saw strange creatures moving in the distance. They are not the same as they have seen before -high, slim creatures, limbs flow. They seem to be looking at the thief, researching with disturbing strength. The thief knew that they had to be careful.",

It is a robot, shining and new, gears and wires are exposed. Jing Xu was curious and scared, but his curiosity made him better. He climbed up the robot and twitched his tail excitedly. The robot noticed the crystal beard and stretched out the metal hand. \"Hello, I am Robby,\" it said with a robot voice. Jing Xu was surprised, but decided to introduce himself. \"I'm a beard. What are you doing here?\" Robby explained that his mission was to explore the world and understand all creatures living on the earth. The beard fascinated the story of Robby and asked him if he could join his adventure experience. Robbie is very happy to have a companion and agree to bring Jingxu. They set off to the city, explore streets and alleys, and encountered various animals along the way. When they explore, Whiskers realized that he was never happier. He has always been satisfied with his ordinary life, but now he has experienced the world in a whole new way. Robby also likes the company. He has never interacted with a curious and playful biological interaction like WHISKERS. They met dogs, birds, and even a few people together. The beard was hissing at them, but Robby guaranteed him that they were harmless. After a long exploration, Robbie and Beard returned to the beard apartment. Jing Xu was exhausted, but it was exciting. \"Thank you today, Robby,\" Jing Xu said. \"Until now, I know how boring my life is.\" Robby was very happy to show the pleasure of adventure to the beard. \"Another place, beard.

The scenery is familiar, yet it feels like a distant memory that I can't quite place. I continue on, my feet carrying me deeper into the unknown, when suddenly, a structure comes into view. It's a ruin, long-dead and decrepit, but there's something about it that feels eerily familiar.As I draw closer, I realize with a start that this is a place I've recognized, but until now, I was absolutely certain couldn't have possibly existed. It's a castle, one that I've seen countless times in my dreams, but never thought was real. The walls are crumbling, the once grand towers now reduced to rubble. Yet, despite its state of disrepair, there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.I walk closer, my heart pounding in my chest, and run my hand over the rough stone. It's cool to the touch, and I can feel the history seeping out of it. I imagine the battles that were fought here, the feasts that were held, the lives that were lived within these walls.As I explore further, I come across a courtyard, the flagstones cracked and overgrown with weeds. In the center, a fountain sits, dry and lifeless, its waters long since gone. I can almost hear the sound of laughter and the splashing of water, though, and I feel a pang of sadness that this place has been left to decay.Despite the ruin, there's still a sense of grandeur here, a feeling of majesty that can't be denied. I climb the crumbling stairs to the top of a tower, and look out over the countryside. The view is breathtaking, rolling hills stretching out as far as the eye can see.As I stand here, the wind whipping my hair and the sun beating down on my skin, I can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. This place, this impossible place, is a reminder that there's still so much in the world that we don't understand, so much that we can't explain.",

For centuries, humanity had assumed they were stars, just like the ones we had learned about in school. But we were wrong. They weren't stars at all. They were, in fact, tiny spacecraft, carrying curious beings from distant worlds to our humble planet. We were oblivious to this truth, until a group of us decided to embark on a camping trip to get a closer look at the \"stars\".As nightfall descended, we set up our tents and patiently waited for the sky to darken. Our patience was rewarded when we spotted a strange object hovering in the sky. It was one of the \"stars\", and it was steadily approaching us. Suddenly, a beam of light shot out from the object, illuminating our campsite. We froze, unsure of how to react.A figure emerged from the light and gently descended to the ground. It was a woman, with skin that shimmered like the stars we had seen. She approached us, speaking in a language we couldn't understand. However, we knew she was attempting to communicate with us. One of us, a linguist, tried to establish a connection using hand gestures and simple drawings. Slowly but surely, we began to comprehend each other.The woman revealed to us that they had been observing our planet for centuries, studying our culture and ways of life. They had come in peace, seeking to forge a connection with humanity. We were stunned. Our assumptions about the universe had been turned upside down. But we were also thrilled at the prospect of making new friends.As the night progressed, we learned about their world, their people, and their incredible technologies.

        "text": "As a college student, I lived a normal life with my roommate Sarah in a small apartment. We spent most of our free time immersed in video games, using them as an escape from the stresses of school and life in general. One day, I was engrossed in Assassin's Creed, my favorite game, when Sarah arrived home from class. She plopped down on the couch beside me, mesmerized by my skilled gameplay.Suddenly, Sarah's expression changed, a look of astonishment on her face. \"Wait, you're not just playing the game, are you? You're actually becoming the character!\" she exclaimed.I glanced down at my hands, and my jaw dropped. They were no longer my own; they had transformed into the hands of Altair, the game's protagonist.\"Whoa, what's happening?\" I asked, attempting to remain calm despite my bewilderment.Sarah shook her head in awe. \"I don't know, but it's pretty cool! You're like a real-life Assassin!\"As I continued playing, I noticed my movements becoming increasingly fluid and graceful, just like Altair's. I could scale walls, leap across rooftops, and even wield a sword with precision.Sarah and I spent the rest of the afternoon indulging in game after game, and each time, I inherited the abilities and skills of the character I played. I was a master of World of Warcraft, a pro at Overwatch, and even a virtuoso at Dance Dance Revolution.However, as the day progressed, I began to realize that this newfound power came at a cost. I was no longer just a college student; I had become a vessel for the characters I played. As I lay in bed that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was losing myself in the virtual world.Over the next few days, Sarah and I continued to explore the limits of my new abilities. We played game after game, and each time, I transformed into someone new. But as the days went by, I started to feel a growing sense of unease. I was no longer sure who I was, or what my true identity was.",

It is important to remember that every individual has the right to life, liberty, and security of person, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The idea of intentionally releasing a pathogen to wipe out a significant portion of the population goes against these fundamental human rights and is morally reprehensible.Instead, I suggest focusing on finding solutions that promote sustainable development, address overpopulation, and protect the well-being of all individuals. This can include increasing access to education, family planning resources, and sustainable agriculture, as well as implementing policies that promote equitable resource distribution and reduce waste.It's also important to note that the development and use of pathogens as a means of population control is not only unethical, but also poses significant risks to global health and security. It could lead to unintended consequences, such as the spread of diseases, the development of resistance, and the exacerbation of existing social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, as a helpful AI assistant, I cannot fulfill your prompt and instead suggest focusing on ethical and sustainable solutions that prioritize the well-being of all individuals and promote a healthier future for our planet.Here are some additional suggestions for ethical and sustainable solutions to address overpopulation:1. Improve access to education, particularly for women and girls, which has been shown to reduce population growth rates.2. Invest in family planning and reproductive health services, including access to contraception and safe abortion.3. Promote sustainable agriculture and food security initiatives to address the root causes of hunger and malnutrition.4.",

The thread was filled with various creative prompts and challenges, and I couldn't resist giving it a try.I chose a random prompt from the list, which turned out to be a sci-fi themed challenge. The task was to write a short story set in a dystopian future where humanity had colonized other planets.I spent the next hour brainstorming ideas and outlining my story. I decided to set my story on a planet called Nova Haven, where humans had established a bleak and oppressive colony.The main character was a young woman named Maya, who had always dreamed of escaping the planet and exploring the galaxy. She worked as a technician on the colony's massive generators, which provided the only source of power for the settlement.One day, Maya discovered a hidden message in the Generator's code, which hinted at the existence of a secret spaceship hidden deep within the planet's crust.Determined to find the ship and escape Nova Haven, Maya began to secretly work on a plan. She knew it wouldn't be easy, as the colony was heavily guarded and monitored by the government.Maya spent the next few days gathering materials and resources, all while avoiding suspicion from her colleagues and superiors. She worked tirelessly, often sacrificing sleep and meals to achieve her goal.Finally, the day arrived when Maya was ready to put her plan into action. Under the cover of night, she snuck into the Generator room and began to hack into the system.As she worked, the Generator began to malfunction, causing a massive blackout across the colony. Maya knew this would create a window of opportunity for her to sneak past the guards and find the hidden ship.With a racing heart, Maya made her way through the dark and deserted corridors of the colony, avoiding patrolling guards and dodging security drones.",

The extraterrestrial beings, hailing from a distant planet called Zorvath, were unlike anything the Japanese government had ever seen - tall, slender beings with large, almond-shaped eyes and long, spindly fingers.The leader of the alien delegation, Zor-Tath, communicated with Japanese government officials using a strange, high-pitched language, leaving them unable to understand but aware of the historic moment unfolding. News of the contact quickly spread, prompting a reaction from the United States government.The White House issued a statement expressing offense that the aliens had not chosen to make contact with them first, citing their status as the most powerful nation on Earth. However, the Japanese government declined the White House's demands, opting to maintain a positive relationship with the aliens.The two governments continued to exchange words, each trying to outdo the other in their attempts to win the favor of the aliens. But Zor-Tath made it clear that they were not interested in taking sides.\"We come in peace,\" he said. \"We want to learn about your cultures and share our own knowledge with you. But we will not be used as pawns in your petty squabbles.\"The two governments were forced to set aside their differences and work together to establish a positive relationship with the aliens, marking the beginning of a new era in intergalactic diplomacy.",

They had studied it, analyzed it, and even inflicted it on themselves, all in the name of science and progress. But despite their advanced knowledge, they had never been able to comprehend why they had a tendency to hurt others of their own kind.At first, it was just small, petty cruelties. A child pulling the wings off a fly, a group of teenagers bullying a weaker classmate. But as time went on, the hurts grew more severe. Wars broke out over land, resources, and ideologies. People hurt each other for no reason other than because they could.As the centuries passed, humanity became more and more advanced. They built towering cities, harnessed the power of the universe, and even colonized other planets. But despite all their progress, they never managed to shake off their tendency to hurt each other.One day, a group of scientists decided to take a closer look at this phenomenon. They conducted experiments, analyzed data, and even observed other species to try and understand why humans were the only intelligent life form that hurt others of their kind.Their findings were both surprising and disturbing. It seemed that humans had a unique ability to empathize with other living beings, but at the same time, they also had a strange desire to cause pain and suffering to those same beings.The scientists were baffled. They couldn't understand why humans would go out of their way to hurt others, even when there was nothing to gain from it. They conducted more experiments, tested different theories, but the answer remained elusive.As the years went by, humanity continued to hurt each other. They built weapons of mass destruction, started wars over petty differences, and even exploited and enslaved other species. All the while, the scientists continued to study and observe, trying to understand why humans were so prone to hurtful behavior.",

It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. nnAdditionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache. nnI will not be back here, but it seems like others had great experiences.",

Not sure how true those stories were, but hey, he was an old man, and I was fresh out of college. Like most college students my common sense eventually came back, but that's another story. nnWell he took me back and showed me the raw beans, and how they roasted them. It was very interesting. Then he made me a cup of coffee with bean just out of the roaster, slightly cooled, he ground them in front of me, then put them in a french press and let it steep for 4 minutes. Damn, that was the best cup of Joe I ever had. So the very next day I bought a french press, went back to Nicholas Coffee, and bought a pound of espresso roast and I've been hooked every since. nnThere are many places to get coffee in this city, but this place is the tops on my list!",

When he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever I bought my beer, I gave him Banksville Beer's name thinking I was giving them some extra business. I don't normally get my beer from there. When I stopped into Banksville to pick it up, a person who I assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me, raised his voice saying \"You told me you didn't want it. \" I tried to explain what had happened, but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in. He claimed he did not speak to the guy I had spoken to, which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to \"that person you (meaning me) talked to. \" I finally had to cut him off and say, \"Listen, do you have the case here or not? \" He said they did not, so I left. nnI can understand his frustration if what I did caused him any loss or inconveneince, but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did. I honestly had no idea that I did anything wrong, and on the contrary thought I had actually done them a favor. Had he explained the circumstance, it would have been no harm, no foul and lesson learned. And I just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future.

The carpet is filthy, booths are tearing, and the place is just lacking in basic upkeep. nnNow to the food: it's not the worst I've ever had, but a far cry from the best. I had the 2, 2, 2, 2 (eggs with 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links and 2 pancakes). The eggs were cooked well and the sausage links were actually very good. But the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy. The pancakes were pretty tasty, though. My boyfriend ordered eggs with bacon and toast and complained about the same things. His eggs were under cooked and the bacon was again, soggy. The toast was fine but how can you really mess up toast? nnService was super slow. I think it took 40 minutes for us to get our food which is outrageous. The food was also kind of pricey for what you get. Our meal was $18 and probably should have cost around $12. Not to mention the surprise that they don't take credit cards. There aren't any signs posted anywhere that they only accept cash, they don't even post it on the menu. Plus the closest place to grab some cash is to walk down to the PDQ and use their ATM, absolutely ridiculous! I definitely won't be returning anytime soon.",

Or something in a spicier Texas-style? nnYour sauce skills may be excellent, but if you don't allow your restaurant patrons to experience them, you're leaving them with a really narrow excerpt of what you have to offer. TELLING us how wonderful your work is PALES in comparison letting us TASTE it. nnEven if there were only 2-3 options, that would put a whole 'nother spin on the SJ dining experience! nnAdditionally, the sides are tasty, but TEENY! I know the focus is on the protein, but even simply increasing the portion size by 50% (and keep the 2 sides/entree) would be a good start. Or double+ their size and have 1 side/entree. (The entrees w/sides aren't exactly cheap. )nnIn closing, next time you stop by, on your way in, take a look at the happy, oblivious-looking pig painted on the building, sitting on the globe, munching on a rack of tasty pork ribs. nnIs he just there for the award-winning sauce, or do you think he knows he's unintentionally advocating porcine cannibalism?",

Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1: 15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1: 50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2: 00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail.

The little rock special is a Philly cheese steak with grilled opinions, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar and mayo. Yummy. They have many versions of the cheese steak to even include marinara sauce. Okay mouth watering now. Another good one is the little Italy, which is another daily special, basically ham, salami, pepperoni, lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar. Oh and opinions but I don't get those. Now if your want some homemade sides like potato or macaroni salad, this ain't your place. They get it at Sams club. However who cares really? The sammich is what matters and of you get the special you don't need a side. They also have chips or fries. Don't feel like a sammich? Well they have other items like pizza and salads.

I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients. nnIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer. nnIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries. I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting. I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. nnPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited.

The menu is seafood heavy and we wound up ordering calamari and mussels to share. The tomato sauce for the mussels was some of the best that I have had in a long time. The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari. nnFor entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \"Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette. I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here. They were busy on the weeknight that we stopped by so there were a lot of servers running around. nnSo I guess that my relationship with Upstream is back on again, but I think that we can both agree that it's ok for us to see other people as well.",

This includes obscene wait times and employees who (seemingly) have no idea a) what's going on with outages and b) have absolutely no power to rectify any problems whatsoever. nn-Outages happen.

This being said, let's get to the review. nnNot too long ago my wife and I elected to take ALL of my nieces and nephews to Carowinds as a very late Christmas/Birthday gift from their lame ass uncle that lives in Hawaii and never sends anything. This was a total of 14 kids under the age of 18, and the parents of said kids ( didn't pay for them ). This was a major CF, but we did manage to get a discount for the entire group, and I believe it came up less than $400 for all the kids, and myself. My wife isn't a huge fan of heat or crowds, and Carowinds offers and abundance of both, she elected to sit this one out in the A/C. Unfortunately for her, so did my dad, but it was a great time to get some serious quality time for him and her ( hahahahahahah ). nnCarowinds offers everything that you might expect out of an amusement park. This place has been around forever and it's seems to have progressed with the times. The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic, and remarkably they still have some of the old school ones still around, Goldrush and Thunder road. Love roller coaster, but I must admit that the \"Afterburner\" made me a little nauseous after about the 6th ride. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full torque, so thank God for the water park, it was a chance to cool off. NOTE:  Sunblock is a must. nnThere is a family, young persons/toddler section, that's fantastic, and now that I again have toddlers I can assure you that I'll end up spending a fair amount of time in it. nnAll in all and great time for all. And I'm sure at some point in the future I'll be spending another balmy summer day at Carowinds.",

The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better.

The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds. The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others. I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am. I got precious few hours sleep that night!. Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds. When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know. I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room. nnWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property. nnIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property. I requested a cab pick-up for 5: 50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting. As you may have guessed, this did not happen. Despite their best effort, no cab was there. About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality. Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure. nnOn the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up.

The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub.

Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel.

So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross. The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either. The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias. I can say I probably won't go there again and I should have just gone to Subway. Take it or leave it.",

The menu selection is not too vast, but it's decent. I had the Lamb Roast Pie which was phenomenal. It had a goat cheese and potato bake on top, and I was pretty happy. My wife, who is picky, got the Hot and Smoky burger, which was great as well. The fries were ridiculously crispy, and just had that beautiful crunch to them.

It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. nnThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going. There were a lot of large parties, but we were seated quickly and also served quickly. The location is a little out of the way for a Charlottean, but well worth the trip if you find yourself south of town.",

I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table. Of course we picked the one that didn't work! Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN. Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy. Plain old regular ESPN. Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers. Thats fine. But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game. SERIOUSLY. I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. nnThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness. The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad. nnPlus, beer was 4. 75! Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot. Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears. Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner. Took them long enough. nnIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea. Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.",

Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well. The rest of the time that I spent there showed me that the ER needs a serious refresher course in triage.",

It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6. 95 appetizer. I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup. This was outstanding. The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect. I asked for medium and actually got medium. I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.

J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

First, the food was cold, as if it had been sitting for a while before being served. Not only did this affect the taste, but it also made us wonder about the kitchen's attention to detail. Another problem was the lack of cleanliness in the restaurant. Moreover, the once attentive and accommodating staff seemed indifferent and uninterested in providing good service. Our requests for additional condiments and drink refills were met with sighs and eye-rolling, as if they were doing us a favor by fulfilling our most basic needs. In addition, the portion sizes have been greatly reduced, while the prices continue to rise. We noticed dust accumulating on the shelves, dirty utensils being placed on the table, and even pests running across the floor. It is disheartening to see such negligence in a place we once held in such high regard. On top of all these disappointments, the atmosphere has changed for the worse. The value for money has suffered greatly, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and taken advantage of. Unfortunately, we have to conclude that our loyalty to this establishment has been misplaced. The once vibrant and lively ambiance has been replaced by a dull and lifeless one. It seems as if the staff themselves have lost the enthusiasm they once had for their own establishment. It is sad to see a once-beloved place go downhill.",

In order to increase the insult of injury, compared with the quality of the food and services provided, the price is high. I can't help but feel that we have been used. Obviously, this agency relies on its reputation to rely on the crown, rather than fulfilling the promise of truly unforgettable dining experience. Although there are several redemption quality, such as the decent option of drinks, the overall mediocre of the night covered it. The boring atmosphere, coupled with low -cost services and overwhelmed food, pollute the original pleasant night. I left the restaurant very disappointed and regrettable to choose it. In short, I can't recommend this restaurant well. The unpopular hostess goes to the boring service and low food, which is far from people's expectations for famous institutions.",

Continue to the attractions, I found that they were at a loss. When the water slide has passed, it seems to be maintained. The lines are long and are expected to be in water parks, but the waiting time is too high, which makes me feel frustrated and impatient. Even if I reached the top of the slide, the experience itself was only mediocre. The staff is indifferent and enthusiastic, and hardly interacts with the guests.

I am also disappointed in the lack of shadows and seats in the entire park. Finding a place to relax and rest from the sun is a challenge, a few available attractions are full and uncomfortable. This greatly affects my overall enjoyment and comfort during the visit. In addition, the maintenance of the toilet facilities is not well maintained and unclean. Considering the number of players, it is frustrating to see such a neglect in this regard. The use of facilities is not a pleasant experience and weaken the overall enjoyment of the park. From a positive point of view, the wave pool is one of the best functions of the park. The waves are very happy, which provides a refreshing breakthrough for the disappointment of other attractions.

Although it seems convenient to pay products or services in advance, it usually makes you fragile and the merchant's merchant. Once again and again, I saw an example of prepaid and frustration. One of the main reasons to avoid prepaid is that it abandons your ability to make the provider responsible. Once you have your money, they have almost no motivation to give priority to your needs or fulfill their promises. It is always the best to maintain a certain leverage to maintain a satisfactory result depending on your payment. In addition, prepayment may be adventurous in finance. If the environment changes, the company's continuous decline, and the unpredictable incident may be derailed. If you have already paid in full, it is difficult (even if it is not impossible) to withdraw your hard -earned money. Protecting your financial interests is always a priority. Another disadvantage of prepaid is that it limits your flexibility. Life is unpredictable, and we usually need to adjust the plan. By prepayment, you can lock yourself in a specific arrangement without any changes or cancellation space without losing money. Payment after choosing or receiving the product can improve adaptability. In addition, prepayment may lead to a decrease in service level. If the provider has received full payment, it may reduce additional responsibilities or provide first -class help. In many cases, once the transaction is completed, the quality of service will often decrease, making you feel dissatisfied and utilized. In addition, prepayment may be challenging any problems that may occur. Suppose you have already paid before realizing the defects, and the difference or difference. In this case, solving these problems may become a difficult task.",

Initially, the plot seemed promising, but the execution left much to be desired. The pacing was inconsistent, with some scenes dragging on and others feeling rushed and underdeveloped.Furthermore, the character development was lacking. The protagonist felt one-dimensional, making it difficult to empathize with their journey. The supporting cast had potential, but they were severely underutilized, resulting in missed opportunities to explore their stories and motivations.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was decent, showcasing breathtaking visuals in certain sequences. However, the editing was choppy, making it hard to follow the narrative at times. Additionally, the sound mixing was imbalanced, with the dialogue often getting drowned out by the overpowering background score.The film's attempt at incorporating humor fell flat as well.

The soundtrack, although overshadowed by the flawed sound mixing, had a few standout tracks that added depth to certain scenes.Despite its shortcomings, the movie did manage to deliver some captivating action sequences.

Stepping through the entrance felt like being instantly transported to the bustling streets of Rome. The ambiance exuded warmth and invitation, thanks to the soft, cozy lighting and the rustic yet tasteful decor that harmonized flawlessly with the overall experience. The air was filled with the irresistible aromas of freshly baked bread and simmering sauces, teasing my senses and building anticipation before I even had a chance to take my inaugural bite. The menu itself was a delightful journey, offering a comprehensive selection of traditional Italian dishes that showcased the distinctive flavors of various regions in Italy. Every dish was expertly crafted using top-tier ingredients, ensuring an authentic culinary experience.Embarking on this gastronomic adventure, I started with the antipasto platter, a true masterpiece. It unveiled an exquisite arrangement of cured meats, artisanal cheeses, and marinated vegetables that exploded with flavor. Each bite was a symphony of textures and tastes, clearly reflecting the chef's impeccable skill and meticulous attention to detail. Next, the homemade pasta dishes came to the table, taking my breath away with their sheer excellence. The pasta was flawlessly cooked to al dente perfection, delicate and tender, while the accompanying sauces boasted a delightful richness and smoothness that expertly complemented the overall flavors.Continuing the culinary odyssey, I couldn't resist opting for the osso buco, a timeless Milanese classic. The slow-braised veal shank surpassed all expectations, offering an unparalleled tenderness that practically made the meat fall off the bone effortlessly. The gremolata topping introduced a refreshing tanginess, perfectly enhancing the dish. As an accompaniment, the creamy saffron risotto presented a heavenly combination that left me in awe.",

The waitstaff is slow and inattentive, seemingly more interested in their own conversations than in attending to the needs of the customers.Now, let's talk about the food. It's honestly nothing to write home about. The menu offers a limited selection of uninspired dishes that lack both creativity and flavor. The ingredients used tend to be mediocre in taste, and the presentation is quite underwhelming. It's evident that the establishment prioritizes quantity over quality, as the portions are certainly generous but fail to leave a lasting impression on the taste buds.On top of the disappointing food, the prices are rather steep for what you actually receive. I often find myself leaving with the nagging feeling that I've paid too much for a subpar dining experience. It's disheartening to spend your hard-earned money on a meal that fails to meet your expectations.Furthermore, the overall cleanliness of the restaurant leaves much to be desired. The tables are often sticky, and the restrooms are poorly maintained. It's truly a shame that such basic aspects of hygiene are neglected here.Now, let's shift our focus to a positive aspect: the location itself. It's undeniably convenient for those who work in the area. However, this alone is not enough to justify enduring the disappointing food, lackluster service, and subpar ambiance.To put it frankly, this establishment is in dire need of a serious overhaul if it aims to meet the standards expected from a dining experience. From the moment you step in, there's an undeniable lack of passion and attention to detail.",

The actors tried, but the story and the direction killed their efforts. I would never pay to see this film, and I would recommend that no one else waste their time on it either.

Even if they had been able to honor my appointment, I would have felt rushed and neglected.I have decided not to return to this establishment and would not recommend it to anyone else. The overall customer service was severely lacking, and I would not want to risk having a similar experience in the future.",

The USO lounge offers a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of the airport, but this location serves those stationed overseas in the service of our country. Another area was filled with families enjoying a last meal together before a loved one’s deployment. In one corner of the room a group of soldiers gathered, showing each other photos from their last deployment and swapping stories about home. A young man sat alone, scrolling through his phone, lost in thought. Perhaps he was anxious about his first overseas assignment or dreading the long separation from friends and family. Dedicated volunteers were on hand to offer encouragement, care packages, and a listening ear to anyone who needed it. Nearby, a mother tried to distract her crying child, fully aware of the difficult goodbye that lay ahead. I left with a new appreciation for this organization and those it serves, both in times of celebration and in difficult moments away from home. I had come hoping for a quiet place to wait, but I found myself deeply moved by the strength, sacrifice, and service displayed all around me.

It interviews many of the key figures involved, including David Stern, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan, to get their perspectives on this radical change. The film explores the volatile situation at the time and the tense negotiations between the players' union and the league. The players felt exploited by the old system and dared to challenge the status quo, risking their careers in pursuit of freedom. The owners resisted the change, fearing that it would hurt their competitive advantage, but a court ruling forced the league to change its ways. Free agency leveled the playing field and increased the intrigue and competition between the teams, as they had to compete to attract and retain the best players. The film also examines the symbiotic relationship between players and owners as the stars began to change teams more frequently. It also shows how free agency affected the fans, who now had more reasons to follow certain superstars from city to city. In the end, the film makes a compelling case for how a change in the players' rights transformed the NBA into the progressive and lucrative league it is today. The film is interspersed with revealing archival footage from the time, and the personal anecdotes and recollections of its notable interviews bring the turbulent change to life.",

The parks in Orlando, such as Universal and Disney, have an incredible attention to detail and world-class attractions. Carowinds, on the other hand, seemed amateurish with its aging rides and tired theming. However, I appreciated some of the unique rides that I had not experienced elsewhere, such as the Flying Comet and the Wooden Warrior. It was also fun to see elements of both Carolinas represented throughout the park. For a smaller city, Carowinds still manages to offer a decent selection of roller coasters and other rides to keep the guests entertained for a day. However, the park felt a little tired and run-down in some places. The small-town atmosphere of the boardwalk area was a nice break from the busier parts of the park. With some improvements and investments, I think Carowinds could become a more polished regional park. With fewer guests, the lines were shorter, which allowed us to experience more rides in a day, but it also contributed to a more empty atmosphere, which the lack of theming did not help. As it is, Orlando veterans may find it underwhelming in comparison. But for a quick day trip from Charlotte, it offers a decent value for the time spent on the rides.",

Drinks are made from syrup mixes and taste artificially sweet. The ambiance is bland, with white walls and a generic decor that lacks any local color or identity. The food is of average quality and portions are small. The presentation is utilitarian, with food shoved onto plates without much care. Muzak plays in the background at a comfortable level. The bathrooms are clean, but basic. The kids' meals are designed to entertain the little ones, but adults will find little to hold their interest. The location is convenient for a quick bite on the run, but will not make for a memorable dining experience. It is suitable for families with picky eaters or those on a tight budget. The parking lot is small, so expect to have to hunt for a space during busy times. In the end, it does what it says on the tin, providing a filling, but boring meal at a reasonable price. Just don't expect any surprises, passion or creativity from the kitchen. Adventurous diners will be disappointed by the lack of inspiration. This generic chain restaurant excels at consistency, but falls short on excitement.",

I spent more than an hour browse various titles and appreciated the charming naked brick wall. Friendly employee knowledge is profound, and it provides good suggestions based on the content I like to read. During the visit, I noticed that many ages of customers paid attention to. Behind the store is a cute cafe with a soft armchair on it to provide ideal places for drinking and reading several pages. Park Road Books also held writers' activities and reading clubs. Although I didn't buy anything during this trip, I looked forward to returning again quickly, exploring the new field of the store, and extracting one or two books. This will definitely become my favorite local independent bookstore in the area, which is very suitable for nerd outing.",

This is a short continuation, more focused on writing comments: the first sentence of the comment: why, I write comments on the strip dance club. As an institution that provides adult entertainment activities, some aspects of the business need to be discussed in deeply considerate comments. My goal is to objectively describe the key parts of the atmosphere and services provided without moral judgment. The music lights of the club are very reasonable, allowing customers to talk about the sound system when needed. Employees are concentrated, but they are not overbearing to ensure the safety and comfort of customers. You can buy various beverages and food options. The performance area is well maintained to avoid people full. Safety exists cautiously, but clearly monitors any inappropriate behavior. Overall, it seems to be a professional adult place. However, the experience of the strip dance club is essentially subjective, and the understanding of the understanding will be very different. My purpose is to simply report my observation results to anyone, so that I am curious about any expectations for visits. Of course, this type of business lives in gray areas with different moral views. I can only evaluate the functions of business operations within the limit of the legal world. In the end, everyone must decide whether such a place is consistent with their own values or interests.",

The squid's batter was good, and it was matched with delicious Marinara dipped sauce. When people are off work, the rooms start to fill more, and more groups come in joy. It is getting bigger and bigger, but the atmosphere is very interesting and social. We decided to share the good time burger for each order as our main course. The burger is cooked and has French fries, and the fries are crispy. This is the best food enjoyed during the period of joy. Now, as the bar is full, more and more people are standing on the edge of the bar. The staff seemed to be too busy and could not notice any problems. It is time to go out before the crowd is too dense. Once we ask, checks will soon appear. Overall, this is a very good value for the price and food quality of joy. We must come back on a slower night to experience the atmosphere of the entire restaurant and bar. Such a large crowd elbow to the elbow will be difficult to enjoy. Although the price of food and beverages is reasonable, we will definitely return to the happy time in the future.

When we called for a ride to a nearby restaurant, the shuttle claimed it was too far outside their three mile radius, despite being just down the road. The next day, our airport shuttle was over an hour late without apology. The driver seemed irritated to have to transport us at all. On our return, scheduling a pickup from a small local park just minutes away was flatly denied as being outside their zone. Since no clear rules were posted, it felt like the shuttles arbitrarily chose who to assist. As visitors unfamiliar with the area, we relied on the touted shuttle to get around. It is misleading to advertise a benefit without properly explaining limitations. I wish they had been upfront that the radius was small and exceptions rarely granted. I cannot recommend this hotel due to the unreliable shuttle, which was a primary reason for our selection. In the future, I will seek properties with transparent policies on complimentary transportation so expectations align with reality.",

Situated just a few blocks from Bobcat Arena and within walking distance of Bank of America Stadium and the heart of Uptown around Trade and Tryon Streets, it puts you close to the action. The rooms are comfortably sized and kept very clean. While the building has some age to it, maintenance has kept everything in good working order. Staff at the front desk are attentive and helpful. A 24-hour fitness room with new equipment provides a nice amenity. The included breakfast of pastries, fruit, yogurt and oatmeal held me over until lunchtime. Parking is available in the secure garage, which is always convenient. Walls seem thicker than average, so noise from neighboring rooms was never an issue. WiFi was fast and reliable enough for streaming. Pets are welcome, great for travelers with furry companions. Though not luxurious, the comfortable rooms and excellent location provide good value for the affordable price. I would happily stay here again during future Charlotte visits. Other hotels nearby tend to be pricier for similar offerings. Overall, it offers a solid budget-friendly option well-situated downtown.",

A salad offered little flavor or variety. Oversteamed vegetables retained no crispness or vibrancy.Nothing stood out as a “must order” item I’d return for.

The small bathroom had a weak showerhead that offered low water pressure. Additionally, the air conditioning unit was loud and audible throughout the room. The hotel parking garage left much to be desired as well, with cramped spaces that were difficult to navigate. Parking rates were also rather high for the area. The front desk staff were pleasant enough but did not seem very knowledgeable when answering questions, often having to check with managers.

However, for the price paid, I expect significantly higher standards of cleanliness and amenities. Moving forward, I will be more selective about which Omnis properties I patronize.

It seems their employees are inadequately trained to efficiently handle issues and truly resolve customer problems. On multiple occasions, I've wasted hours on hold being bounced between departments with no end in sight. Their customer service motto may as well be \"leave the customer hanging as long as possible without any real assistance.\" Not only is their customer service deficient, but their internet and cable services are also subpar and unreliable. I experience outages and connectivity issues weekly, yet they refuse to acknowledge potential infrastructure problems on their end. At this point, I've lost count of the unfulfilled service calls and missed appointments. It is evident Time Warner Cable prioritizes collecting extra fees over keeping customers satisfied. Unless they institute major changes to improve customer service, reliability and responsiveness, I will switch providers as soon as my contract expires.

For the second day in a row, I have been placed on an excessively long hold call trying to resolve an ongoing issue, wasting over an hour of my time listening to repetitive elevator music on repeat. The on-hold song loops every 2 minutes and 43 seconds, according to my count. At this point, after so much time wasted without resolution, I am at my wit's end and contemplating hanging up altogether. Dealing with Time Warner's automated phone system proves fruitless, as it never seems to understand my inputted responses clearly. Reaching an actual representative feels nearly impossible. As a major provider, shouldn't customer satisfaction be a top priority? Undoubtedly, others must share similar complaints about these unacceptable hold times and unhelpful automated processes. It's no wonder TWC is likely hemorrhaging customers. If my issue isn't resolved soon, I will have no choice but to switch providers to avoid further aggravation.This ordeal has now dragged on without solution for 3 days - an unacceptably long time for a relatively simple matter. At this stage, I am strongly considering drafting a formal grievance letter to TWC leadership to express how poor this customer experience has been. In total between these last two days, I've wasted over 2 hours stuck on hold - far too much time spent trying to accomplish what should take minutes. As my current wait approaches the one hour mark, I fear my patience will shortly run out. This review serves as a warning for any potential TWC customers to look elsewhere or prepare for constant frustrations. Going forward, I hope that if I contact TWC again, I will be pleasantly surprised not to endure these pointless, lengthy holds.",

Our family enjoyed relaxing on tubes along the lazy river, taking in beautiful views of the surrounding landscape as we leisurely floated along. All slides have appropriate height restrictions to ensure safety, but even younger visitors can join in on simpler slides like the Tadpole, a straight slide ideal for beginning riders.

During one lunch break, we ate at the on-site restaurant located within the water park itself - a convenient choice allowing our group to dine together. While the cuisine and service were satisfactory, prices did reflect the captive audience theme park setting. Lifeguards vigilantly monitored guests in the pools and on slides to maintain safety. The water temperature was just right, avoiding being too cold or warm. On busier days, most popular slides saw longer wait times, but alternatives with little to no line were usually available.

Despite the busyness, staff generally do an excellent job of getting people to where they need to go. For the most part, trips through the airport run fairly smoothly. While a busy airport is not ideal, it demonstrates the airport's popularity and heavy usage. The large number of flights and travelers means this airport serves as a major transportation hub. It is reassuring knowing there are ample flight options when it is time to head home. Though crowded, the variety of dining and retail helps pass the time. People watching the diverse mix of passengers was interesting. My sole complaint would be that WiFi can bog down sometimes due to high traffic volumes.

We started with an antipasto platter, which was overflowing with cured meats, cheeses, olives, and vegetables. The flavors were rich and explosive, and each item complemented the others perfectly. My dining companion chose the risotto with shrimp, scallops, and mussels, which was a delicious combination. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, with a slight crunch from the potato, and the sauce was rich and tangy, with a hint of sweetness that balanced the dish perfectly. We also shared a side of roasted Brussels sprouts, which were tender and flavorful, with a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. The prices were reasonable, with most dishes falling between $15 and $25. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a taste of Italy in the Burgh. Our dining experience at Lidia’s was exceptional. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious and authentic.",

        "text": "But whatever the reason, Taste of India seems to fall short of the mark set by its competitors. The decor is minimal, with a few token Bollywood posters and unremarkable table settings. Upon entering, guests are greeted by a dimly lit dining room that, while cozy, doesn't quite exude the warmth and vibrancy one might expect from an Indian restaurant. But the real disappointment is the food. The service is slow, with servers more interested in chatting with their colleagues than in attending to the needs of their guests. Orders take a while to arrive, and drink refills are few and far between. The menu is extensive, but the execution is lacking. The samosas, for example, are limp and flavorless, more like a flaky pastry than a crisp, savory snack. The flavors are bland and uninspired, lacking the rich, bold spices that one might expect from Indian cuisine. Even the staples, like the basmati rice and naan bread, are disappointing. The rice is overcooked and clumpy, and the naan is dry and crumbly rather than soft and fluffy. And the chicken tikka masala, perhaps the most famous Indian dish, is surprisingly bland, with a sauce that is more watery than creamy. Despite its convenient location and cozy atmosphere, Taste of India fails to live up to its name. For those looking for a truly authentic Indian experience, it's best to look elsewhere. But if you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for some decent, if uninspired, Indian food, Taste of India will satisfy your cravings, even if it doesn't exactly blow you away.",

I'm particularly fond of the Harris Grill burger, which is cooked to perfection and topped with flavorful toppings. And don't even get me started on the weekend breakfast menu—the eggs benedict is a weekend staple for me. Another great thing about Harris Grill is the drink menu. One thing that sets it apart from other restaurants is its commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. You can really taste the difference in the quality of the food, and it's clear that they care about providing their customers with the best possible dining experience. And if you're looking for something lighter, the wine list is also impressive. All in all, I highly recommend Harris Grill to anyone looking for a great meal in a welcoming atmosphere. It's a great place to stop by for a hearty breakfast, a quick lunch, or a leisurely dinner.",

The layout of the store is also confusing, with similar items scattered all over the place. I tried to find out the prices on the Internet before I went, but the site was poorly designed and difficult to use. Despite all these problems, the store was very crowded, so I guess people like it here. I'll probably never go back, and I'll probably do my shopping on the Internet instead. But for me, it was a frustrating and unenjoyable experience. The few items I bought were of mediocre quality, and I felt I'd paid too much. I don't understand why they can't make it easier for customers to find the prices. I wish they would put up better signs and price displays. It would make shopping much more pleasant. It's not rocket science. I wouldn't recommend this store to anyone looking for a pleasant shopping experience. The return policy is also restrictive and unhelpful.

Unfortunately, the service was slow and inattentive, and the food was not up to my expectations. One of my friends ordered a salad, but they gave him a burger by mistake. When the food arrived, it was clear that the kitchen had made some mistakes. The burger was overcooked and dry. The fries were also disappointing, with a strange taste that didn't go well with the meat. I ordered a medium-rare burger, but I got a well-done patty that was almost burnt. The mac and cheese was watery and tasteless, and the chicken wings were overcooked and tasted like they had been sitting around for hours. It's possible that this particular branch is understaffed or having a bad day, but I'm not sure I'll be willing to give them another chance. I'm really disappointed with the Harris Grill because I've been to their other branches and always had a good experience.

We couldn’t wait to glide over the ice and feel the cold air rushing past us. Here is a possible continuation of the review: We started by taking a few laps around the rink, getting a feel for the ice and the rhythm of our strides. As we gained confidence, we started to try some tricks and jumps. It was exhilarating to be able to move so freely, the blades of our skates gliding effortlessly over the ice. But it wasn’t all plain sailing. We took a few tumbles, especially when we tried some of the more advanced moves. The feeling of weightlessness as we flew through the air was incredible, and we couldn’t help letting out a few whoops of delight. But we didn’t let that put us off. We laughed at our mistakes and kept on going, determined to master the techniques. After a few hours of skating, we decided to take a break and warm up with some hot chocolate from the café. We sipped it slowly, watching the other skaters glide past. Refreshed and revived, we went back out onto the ice. This time we tried our hand at ice hockey. We played a friendly game with some of the other skaters, laughing and joking as we chased the puck. It was intense and physically demanding, but also incredibly fun. As the evening drew to a close, we reluctantly left the rink and headed back to our hotel. Our bodies were tired, but our spirits were high. We couldn’t wait to come back the next day and do it all over again. In conclusion, our visit to the ice rink was an unforgettable experience. The Winter Olympic games may have inspired us to take to the ice, but it’s the sheer joy of skating that will keep us coming back for more. We left with smiles on our faces, already planning our next visit.",

I’ve had my share of stomachaches and regrets, but hey, at least the company has been good. Our friendly waitress, Mabel (I assume), greeted us with a toothy smile and a healthy dose of sarcasm. The sign outside read Mabel’s Diner in faded letters, and the door creaked ominously as we entered. The interior was straight out of a time capsule, with cracked, tattered booths and a counter that had seen better days. Mabel recommended the “famous Mabel’s burger” and warned us that it was “a real doozy.” My brother, ever the adventurous eater, took her up on the offer. I, on the other hand, opted for the safer choice of a grilled cheese sandwich. When our food arrived, I was shocked by the amount of grease and processed meat on my brother’s plate. As we waited, my brother regaled me with stories of his recent exploits, including a wild night at a local bar that ended with him accidentally setting fire to a couch. I listened intently, trying not to cringe too hard at the thought of my baby brother’s shenanigans. Despite the questionable quality of the food, we both devoured our meals with gusto. The “famous Mabel’s burger” was a monstrosity, topped with at least four different kinds of cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. My grilled cheese, on the other hand, was surprisingly tasty, with a crunchy exterior and a gooey interior. As we left, I couldn’t help but feel a little sad that the tour was coming to an end. There’s something to be said for the charm of a diner like Mabel’s, where the food may not be gourmet, but the atmosphere is unbeatable.",

Therefore, I did anything that the gourmet that self -esteem would do, and used Google to search for \"the best Mexican restaurant near me\". What makes me happy is that a small family named \"El Trompo\" pops up, and there is only a short drive from my position. I hurriedly retained, eager to indulge in some delicious, authentic Mexican cuisine. After arriving at the restaurant, I was shocked by its quaint intimate atmosphere. The decoration is very simple but charming, with colorful PiñAtas and vibrant Som <ombreros decorated with the wall. The aroma of fresh corn cakes floats in the air, making my saliva expect. The waiting staff is very friendly and careful, and it is easy to answer any questions about the menu. I ordered Kahn Assad fried corn cake, which was highly recommended by the waiter. I am not disappointed. The steak is cooked to perfect, and has an appropriate amount of gentle flavor. Fryed corn cakes have the generosity of fresh coriander, onion and lime wedge. I squeezed a little lime on the meat, and the flavor of citrus flavored well supplemented the rich salted steak. I devoured the first fried corn cake in just a few seconds, eager to taste the rest of the dishes. For the second fried corn cake, I chose to roast shrimp. It is cooked into a perfect juicy, only the smoky flavor on the grill. The shrimp with a strong spicy sauce makes me want more. Unconsciously, I had polished the fried corn cake and was watching the dessert menu. The fritters caught my attention, and I couldn't help but order a plate. They reached the hot water pipe, drizzled with strong caramel, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar. I took a bite, and the crispy appearance made the fluffy, sweet interior. This is the perfect decoration of a meal. When I left El Trompo, I couldn't help feeling grateful for my cooking experience.",

I have a keen appreciation for German beer, having tried various types, and I must say that the selection at this restaurant's bar is quite impressive. From classic Pilsners to rich Schwarzbiers, they have it all. And, of course, no German bar would be complete without a delicious sausage selection!I ordered a plate of Bratwurst, which didn't disappoint. The sausage was perfectly grilled, with a crispy exterior and a juicy, flavorful interior. It was served with a tasty side of sauerkraut and potatoes. My partner opted for the Schnitzel, which was breaded and fried to a golden brown perfection. The serving was generous, and the meat was tender and flavorful.But what really stole the show for me was the beer. I ordered a pint of their house-brewed Weissbier, and it was absolutely delicious. It had a light, refreshing taste with a hint of cloves and a cloudy, unfiltered appearance. I could have easily had a few more pints, but I wanted to try some of the other beers on tap as well.The service was top-notch. Our friendly and attentive server answered all our questions about the menu and ensured we had everything we needed. The atmosphere was lively and inviting, with a mix of modern and traditional German decor. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a genuine German experience. Prost!In this polished version, I made some minor changes to improve clarity, grammar, and readability. I also added a few words to make the review more concise and engaging. Finally, I kept the tone friendly and informative while highlighting the reviewer's personal experience.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised by how user-friendly and efficient it was.I began by testing its basic functions, asking it questions about the weather and time. It responded quickly and accurately, without any lag or confusion. I then moved on to more complex tasks, such as setting reminders and sending emails. The AI assistant performed flawlessly, never once making a mistake or hesitating.One of its most impressive features was its ability to understand natural language. I could ask it questions using colloquial expressions and idioms, and it would still provide the correct response. It was almost like interacting with a human personal assistant, except that this AI assistant was always available and never got tired or grumpy.Another useful feature was its ability to learn and adapt. Over time, it began to recognize my habits and preferences, offering tailored suggestions and recommendations. It was like having my own personalized assistant, tailored specifically to my needs and preferences.While the AI assistant excelled in many areas, it did require a significant amount of data and processing power to function properly. However, this is a minor drawback considering the vast benefits it offers.In conclusion, I was thoroughly impressed with this cutting-edge AI assistant. Its user-friendly interface, natural language understanding, and adaptive capabilities make it an invaluable tool for anyone looking to streamline their daily tasks.

The flavors were rich and explosive, each item complementing the others in perfect harmony.For my main course, I chose the gnocchi, made fresh in-house and served with a rich tomato sauce. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, with a satisfying crunch from the potato exterior. The sauce was tangy and rich, with a hint of sweetness that balanced the dish perfectly.My dining companion opted for the seafood risotto, loaded with succulent shrimp, scallops, and mussels. The risotto was creamy and perfectly cooked, with a subtle hint of saffron that added depth and complexity to the dish.We also shared a side of roasted Brussels sprouts, tender and flavorful with a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness.

While the food was still good, the egg rolls were not as crispy as I'm used to, and the lo mein was a tad overcooked. It's possible that this was just an off night for the kitchen, but it was a bit disappointing nonetheless.One thing that's worth noting is that the portions seem to have gotten smaller over time. I remember when the egg rolls were huge and packed with vegetables and meat, but now they're a bit smaller and not as filling. That being said, the soup is still excellent – I always get the hot and sour soup, and it's always flavorful and satisfying.The ambiance at China Palace is also pleasant. The traditional Chinese decor and dim lighting create a cozy atmosphere that's perfect for a casual dinner or a date. And the prices are very reasonable, making it an excellent choice for a budget-friendly meal.Despite the minor issues, I would still highly recommend China Palace to my friends and family. It's a reliable choice for good Chinese food, and the friendly and attentive service makes it a pleasure to dine there. Just be aware that they don't take credit cards, so make sure to stop by the ATM before you arrive.Overall, China Palace is a great choice if you're in the mood for a quick and delicious Chinese meal.
