We will discuss this potential problem and find that viable solutions can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum. On the other hand, dangerous neutral currents may appear when the mass of a given fermion is determined by the couplings of several Higgs doublets.",

High critical density lines trace regions with similar physical properties across all galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines probe regions with properties that vary across galaxies, and this leads to a star formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogeneous can reproduce the observed correlations between the far-infrared and CO and HCN luminosities, and can explain why these correlations have different slopes. We predict that the slope of the KS law should change for galaxies with a mean density close to the critical density of the line. This prediction may be tested by observations of intermediate critical density lines, or by HCN observations of high-redshift galaxies with very high densities. We argue that deviations from linearity in the HCN-IR correlation at high luminosities are consistent with the assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

In the central 10pc, the stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the AGN luminosity, whereas on kiloparsec scales the luminosities are comparable.

We discuss whether this delay may be due to the role of stellar ejecta in fuelling the black hole. The ejecta from OB stars and supernovae contribute significantly to the mass loss, but because of their high velocities, they are hardly accreted. In contrast, the winds from AGB stars dominate the mass loss and can be accreted very efficiently because of their low velocities.",

We study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan plane on the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effect comes from the change in the mass scale of the Higgsino, which enters via radiative corrections and the kinematics of the decays of the Higgs bosons into supersymmetric particles. While the change in the mass scale can shift the reach of the experiment by about Delta tan beta = 10, the reach is rather stable with respect to the impact of the other supersymmetric parameters. Within the discovery region, we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons can be determined.

This makes the TWA 7 disk (55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (0.9 pc) M-dwarf to be detected.

A comparison of the masses of disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs. debris) as a function of spectral type. We find that the mid-infrared and submillimeter data require the disk to be composed of dust at a range of temperatures.

The present sample of Chandra observations was fitted with the constraints of the charge exchange model and relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra.

The consistency of the cluster model is broken if one adopts the upper limit of the error bars for the speed of the X-ray gas (5000-5400 km/s) and the gas would not be bound by the subcluster halo for a Hubble time.

The conventional effect is in good agreement with the theoretical value at the second-order transition from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state. However, at the first-order transition, the measured temperature change is smaller than the theoretical one at high fields.

These variations in the time between transits can be used to determine theorbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet, even if it has a mass smaller than the mass of the Earth. Small ground-based telescopes have already achieved the photometric precision necessary to detect planets smaller than the mass of the Earth. However, the search for planets by this method is currently limited by the relatively small number of high-precision transits and the insufficient observing time available on existing telescopes. This method complements other methods because it is most sensitive in the vicinity of resonances, where other methods have reduced sensitivity because of degeneracy. A relatively modest investment in a network of small ground-based telescopes (mu$ = 0.5 m) could provide the necessary coverage and thus dramatically increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.",

We show, for example, that a continuous transition to a dominance of cooperation in populations with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing occurs when the ratio of the benefit to the cost of cooperation is smaller than the local population size.

We find that Type 2 AGNs have lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs, and that all the galaxies with line flux ratios below the lowdensity limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that differential infrared extinction of the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in the obscuring torus is responsible for the observed line flux ratios below the low density limit, and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the torus to our line of sight. We also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended and originates primarily from star-forming regions. Since the emission from low-ionization species is extended, any analysis based on line flux ratios from such species obtained with different slit widths is invalid for most nearby galaxies. Since the temperature of the gas, the extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulatedemission on the line ratios are all unknown, we are unable to determine the density of the ionized gas associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample.",

We find that the potential of the CNGS beam to search for sterile neutrinos is limited by the intensity of the beam, but it is significantly enhanced by afactor of two to ten increase in the neutrino flux. In this case, data from both channels allow us to constrain the four-neutrino model.

The wave flux decreases with radius, consistent with energy dissipation. Some newly discovered large ripples beyond 100 kpc and a possible intact bubble at 170 kpc radius may indicate a higher level of activity of the nucleus a few hundred Myr ago. The pressure due to the nonthermal electrons, responsible for the spectral component interpreted as inverse Compton, is high within 40 kpc of the center and enhances the power in the sound waves; it decreases rapidly beyond 40 kpc. The distribution of metals in the cluster gas peaks at a radius of about 40 kpc and is significantly clumped on scales of 5 kpc. The temperature distribution of the soft filaments and the hard X-ray component found within the inner 50 kpc is analyzed in detail. We find no evidence for a thermal component in the radio bubbles. For any thermal gas to have a filling factor in the bubbles exceeding 50%, its temperature must be above 50 keV.",

The spark is able to induce a current in the chain large enough to create micro-welds between some of the beads.

It is an interesting question whether we can determine the evolution of SMBHB and constrain the physical processes. In this paper, we calculate the time variation of jet precession and conclude that jet precession is accelerated in some SMBHBs and decelerated in others. The acceleration of jet precession is related to the jet precession timescale P_rm pr and the SMBHB evolution timescale tau_rm a, and the jet precession timescale $dP_rm pr / dt$ is related to the jet precession timescale P_rm pr and the SMBHB evolution timescale $tau_rm a$, and the jet precession timescale $dP_rm pr / dt$ can be as high as -1.0 with a typical value of -0.2 and can be easily detected. We discuss the differential jet precession of NGC 1275 observed in the literature. If the observed rapid acceleration of jet precession is true, jet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound SMBHB with a mass ratio of $q_rm  0.76$. When the jet precesses from the ancient bubble to the current active jet, the separation of SMBHB decreases from about $1.4 Kpc$ to $800  cm sec$ with an average decreasing velocity $dP_rm / dt$ simeq -1.5  10-6 cm / s$ and the evolution timescale tau_rm a approx 75  108 yr.

In other words, we try to discover production rules in relational databases by a procedure embedded in SQL queries. Such an implementation can take advantage of the efficiency of SQL engines. We use the classical induction decision tree (ID3) method to build the decision tree. The obtained decision tree is defined by a series of related relational views. Each view corresponds to a population in the underlying decision tree. Our implementation of ID3 has been proven to be correct by comparing the results of our procedure with the results of an existing and proven data mining software, SIPINA.

One source of gravitational radiation is the inspiral of a binary system. Two compact bodies, such as two black holes, orbiting each other, lose energy to gravitational radiation, and as the system loses energy, the bodies spiral in towards each other. This causes the speed of the orbit to increase and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic chirp in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binaries in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of massive astrophysical compact halo objects (MACHOs). Some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binaries and detectable by LIGO. Using microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the population, an upper limit is set on the rate of black hole MACHO binaries in the galactic halo. The inspiral of a MACHO binary of two 0.5 M black holes enters the LIGO sensitive band at about 40 Hz.

In the winter episode, the sulfate is mainly affected by condensate, coagulation, and long-range transport, with deposition to a lesser extent. In the summer episode, the effect of long-range transport is largely dominant. To determine the effects of processes not related to the aerosol processes, simulations are also performed with another chemical transport model, CMAQ. The effects of condensate and evaporation are dominant for ammonium, nitrate, and chloride in both episodes, but the effect of thermodynamic equilibrium is limited. The effects of heterogeneous reactions are large for nitrate and ammonium, and it seems that the peaks of nitrate and ammonium are largely affected by heterogeneous reactions. The effects of nucleation are negligible in the summer episode, but small in the winter episode. The effects of coagulation are larger in the winter episode than in the summer episode, because the number of small particles is larger in the winter episode due to the effect of nucleation.

The interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of the up and down transitions between the branches beyond the bifurcation point. Even in the simplest case of a two-level laser with only two possible transitions (up and down), the spectra look like a series of line packets starting well before the population inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of Einstein’s prohibition on the realization of a two-level laser. The multilevel case can be approached by using the concept of thermodynamic activity of the emitting atoms. By assuming that the coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the lasing level atoms is proportional to the ratio of the lifetimes in the upper and lower levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel system.

The reason is that realistic parton showers are required to conserve four-momentum at each vertex. In this paper we investigate in detail how four-momentum conservation is enforced in a standard parton shower and why this destroys the analytic control of the probability distribution. We then show how to modify the parton shower so that it conserves four-momentum at each vertex but for which the full analytic form of the probability distribution is known. We then comment on how this analytic control can be used to match calculations of the parton showers with calculations of the parton distributions and to estimate the effects of power corrections and other uncertainties in the parton showers.",

We work out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means of gauge fixing terms analogous to the renormalizability gauges used in gauge theories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-level interaction between two external tensors of energy-momentum. This interaction is independent of the gauge fixing and is different from the interaction between two external tensors of energy-momentum in the massless theory of gravity, that is, general relativity. This difference remains even if the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity between the propagators of a massive and a massless graviton. We construct an explicit theory in which the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity is associated with a graviton mass term which is different from the Fierz-Pauli graviton mass term.

We believe that TDO measurements provide a very sensitive means of distinguishing between local and itinerant magnetic order.

The only difference is the nature of the source: an electric field in the case of the Schwinger effect and a gravitational field in the case of the inflationary perturbations. In the laboratory, it is notoriously difficult to produce an electric field strong enough to detect the pairs extracted from the vacuum, but the gravitational field in the early universe can be strong enough to produce observable effects, which ultimately manifest themselves as temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.

More precisely, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the AF scheme in a generalmultihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and arbitrary number of hops. First, we provide some basic results on the DMT of the general Rayleigh-like product channels. It turns out that these results have a very simple and intuitive interpretation.

When hard rectangles are mixed with other particles that do not possess tetratic order, the tetratic phase is destabilized by a first- or second-order phase transition to uniaxial nematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles with low aspect ratios, tetratic order persists over a relatively large range of volume fractions.

The resulting Catalogue of Radial Velocities of Open Clusters and Associations (CRVOCA) contains about 460 open clusters and about 60 stellar associations in the local neighbourhood. These numbers still represent less than 30% of the total number of about 1820 objects currently known in the Galaxy. The mean radial velocities of young clusters are generally better known than those of older ones.",

The input to the calculation is the parton dissociation cross-section for quarkonium at NLO in QCD, the quarkonium wavefunction in a temperature-dependent potential from lattice QCD, and a thermal distribution of partons with effective masses. We find that for J/psi the total thermal width above 1.4 Tc is between 100 and 250 MeV, depending on the effective masses of the quarks and gluons, which we take to be between 400 and 600 MeV. Such a width corresponds to an effective dissociation cross-section for gluons of between 1.5 and 3.5 mb and for quarks of between 1 and 2 mb at 1.4 Tc. At similar temperatures we find a much smaller thermal width and effective cross-section for upsilon.",

In the first case the two-particle-to-two-particle contributions summed in the $k_t$-factorization approach dominate at small relative angles and at equal transverse momentum moduli. The collinear NLO two-particle-to-three-particle contributions dominate over the $k_t$-factorization cross section at small relative angles and for asymmetrical transverse momentum distributions. In the second case the NLO contributions vanish at small relative angles and large imbalance in transverse momentum of jets due to simple kinematical constraints.

It is for this reason that PKMs are attracting more and more attention from both academic and industrial research, because they are said to offer several advantages over their serial counterparts, such as high structural rigidity and high dynamic capabilities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses, which reduces inertia effects. PKMs therefore have better dynamic capabilities. However, the design of a PKM is a difficult task that requires further research before it can be used in industry. Many criteria must be taken into account in the design of a PKM. The following sections of this paper are organized as follows: the next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then it is explained why PKMs can be an interesting alternative to the design of machine tools, then existing PKMs are presented.

We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis and determine the density, temperature, and pressure profiles of the interstellarmedium, relying only on the spherical symmetry of the cluster and the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis. Our results for the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tension between the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g., gas temperature, gravitational mass) and the indicators of the structure of the ICM (e.g., gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), with the most significant deviations from the self-similar model in the relations L-T, L-M_tot, M_gas-T, and y_0-T. The measured scatter, however, indicates that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxy for the gas temperature at the same level as other X-ray quantities such asluminosity. When the slope is fixed at the self-similar value, these relations show a consistent negative evolution, suggesting a scenario where the ICM at higher redshift has lower X-ray luminosity and pressure than expected from the self-similar model.",

Because no photons are deliberately destroyed during image acquisition, the technique is muchmore photon-efficient in some observing regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses a combination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear approximation to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, has been used to produce solar spectral images in the 617.34 nm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are now being used to derive Doppler and line-separation data from solar images in the 30.4 nm He II and Si XI lines. In this paper we develop an analytic a priori treatment of the noise in the line-shift signal derived from hybrid differential stereoscopy. We use the analysis to estimate the noise level and measurement precision of a high-resolution solar magnetograph based on stereoscopic spectral imaging, compare the estimates with a test observation made in 2003, and discuss the implications for future instruments.",

This is the best-case scenario forpredicting the solar cycle. Even very weak random fluctuations can lead to significant modulation of the cycle, and this modulation leads to a loss of predictability. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as the target time series that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if the model is correct in all its details. We show that even short-term prediction is impossible if there is even a small error in the input parameters of the fiducial model.

The diffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We post-process the steady-states of our simulations with a simple radiative transfer model to obtain line profiles. Results. The CNM cloudlet is found to expand slightly and heat up, resulting in a decrease in CH and H2 content due to the lower density. The change in physical conditions and the diffusive transport increase the H+ content in the CNM, resulting in an increase in OH and H2O. Turbulent diffusion spreads the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. The enhanced molecular content at the cloudlet-WNM boundary broadens the molecular line profiles and helps excite intermediate energy transitions. Turbulent diffusion brings H2 into contact with the warm gas, resulting in enhanced production of CH+, H3O+, OH and H2O at the boundary. The O lines are sensitive to the spread of the temperature profile in the intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Turbulent diffusion can be a source of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical models of the interstellar medium (ISM).

It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger the convective instability and, like the latter, they lead to an increase in the average shock radius and the mass in the accretion layer.

Having excluded complex and highly nucleated galaxies, the brightness profiles of the remaining 16 objects can be successfully modeled by a Nuker law with a steep central cusp characteristic of ‘power-law’ galaxies (with a logarithmic slope of 0.51–1.07). This result is what we would expect for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previousfindings, and thus extends the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radio-loudness to AGN of much higher luminosity. We explored the robustness of this result against a different choice of analytic form for the brightness profiles, using a Sersic law. In no case did we find evidence of a central light deficit relative to a pure Sersic law, the defining feature of ‘core’ galaxies in this modeling framework.

Such astrometric accuracies can now be obtained with both ground-based and space-based telescopes. However, by the time the next generation of astrometric missions, such as SIM, will have taken data, several decades will have passed since the first astrometric mission, Hipparcos. We propose to use a new astrometric method that uses a future, highly accurate survey, the SIM Quick Look, and Hipparcos data from twenty years ago. Using position errors for SIM of 4 mu a, this method allows the detection and characterization of solar-system analogues (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500) years for companions of 1 (10) Mj. Brown dwarfs and low-mass stellar companions can be detected and characterized if their periods are shorter than about 500 years. Since many tens of thousands of nearby stars can be surveyed with a modest investment of SIM time, and SOSAs may be relatively common, we expect to detect many hundreds of extrasolar planets with long periods. Such a sample would nicely complement the short-period planets found by the radial-velocity method. This sample will provide invaluable constraints on models of planet formation and a database of systems where the location of the giant planets allows the formation of low-mass planets in the habitable zone.",

Positive additive externalities give rise to a family of inverse demand curves that include not only the classical downward sloping curves but also new curves with nonconstant convexity. This model encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics literature. The inverse demand curve is a monotonic function of the rate of adoption. When the ratio of the strength of social influence to the standard deviation of the IWP distribution is small enough, the inverse demand curve is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the rate of adoption. If j is sufficiently large, the inverse demand curve is nonmonotonic, decreasing at low and high rates of adoption and increasing in the intermediate range. Depending on the price, there are either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we show the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the system has different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These properties are shown to depend only on the qualitative properties of the IWP distribution: its mode (number of peaks), its smoothness, and the type of support (finite or infinite).

We find that the QPO spectrum is generally similar to the spectrum of the radiation emitted at the QPO radius, broadened by the effects of the relativistic effects. In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the component of the disc in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario. Secondly, we assume that only a hot accretion flow emitting X-rays is oscillating, and the cold disc is absent at the QPO radius. We find that the QPO spectrum does not contain the component of the disc. We also review the available data on the energy dependencies of high-frequency QPOs and note that they seem to lack the disc component in their spectra.

Assuming a dipole magnetic field configuration, this shift in the spectral energy of the cyclotron harmonic corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region of about 2 km, while other spectral properties, in particular the cut-off energy, remain essentiallyconstant. We have found significant variations in the pulse profile with energy, luminosity, and time. At a luminosity of about 5 1037erg/s, four almost equally spaced cyclotron harmonics are clearly visible in the spectrum.

The gravitational field due to all halos in each LV is compared with the exact gravitational field due to all matter in the simulation. Two unconstrained simulations of the flat-Lambda and open cosmologies were also performed for comparison. The results show that there is no correlation between the exact and the local gravitational field due to the pair-wise Newtonian forces between the halos. The exact gravitational field is correlated with the peculiar velocities, but the proportionality constant between the velocity and the gravitational field is smaller than that predicted by the linear theory. When considering all matter in the LVs, the exact and the local gravitational fields show a much better correlation, but with a large scatter that is independent of the cosmological model.

We employ theoretical models and computational methods to study both the quantum and classical spin dynamics on this distorted lattice.First, we examine the effects of geometric frustration on the ground state properties of the quantum spin system. By considering various exchange interactions, we analyze the spin configurations and energy landscapes, revealing the emergence of exotic magnetic ground states. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of an external magnetic field on the spin excitations, highlighting the rich magnetic behavior resulting from the interplay between frustration and distortion.We also study the classical spin dynamics on the spatially distorted Kagome lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. By considering different temperature regimes and exchange interactions, we unravel the thermodynamic properties such as the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. Our results demonstrate the presence of magnetic ordering transitions and the sensitivity of the spin correlations to the lattice distortions.Through a comparative analysis between the quantum and classical spin models on the distorted Kagome lattice, we elucidate the role of quantum fluctuations in influencing the magnetic properties of Volborthite. Additionally, we discuss the connection between the observed spin dynamics and the experimental measurements of Volborthite's magnetic susceptibility and specific heat.Our findings shed light on the collective behavior of spins on spatially distorted Kagome lattices and provide insights into the magnetic characteristics of Volborthite.",

The aim is to enhance our understanding of the chemical kinetics and flame structure in such fuel mixtures, which can provide valuable insights for the development of cleaner combustion technologies. Experimental measurements were conducted using a flat-flame burner under variable reactant conditions and various dopant concentrations. Laser-induced fluorescence was employed to quantify the species mole fractions, while chemiluminescence imaging was used to visualize the flame structure. The results reveal that the addition of allene and propyne affects the flame temperature, resulting in changes in the flame structure and burning velocities. Furthermore, these light unsaturated hydrocarbons exhibit different combustion characteristics compared to methane alone, with distinct patterns of species formation and consumption. The findings suggest that the chemical interactions between allene, propyne, and methane play a crucial role in controlling the flame behavior in rich methane premixed laminar flames. This work contributes to a better understanding of the combustion chemistry in complex fuel systems, aiding in the design of more efficient and environmentally friendly combustion processes. Future research should focus on additional hydrocarbon dopants and investigate the influence of operating parameters on flame dynamics.",

If the Responder accepts, both players receive the money according to the proposed division.

We consider a population of players who play the game repeatedly and use a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for both the Proposer and the Responder. We find that the strategies that evolve are highly dependent on the initial conditions of the population. For example, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a fair split of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more cooperative. However, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a very unfair split of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more selfish.Our results suggest that the evolution of behavior in the Ultimatum Game is a complex and dynamic process.

The primary continuum is likely to be produced by Comptonisation in a hot corona, while the reflection component is likely to be produced by reprocessing of the primary X-rays by the accretion disc.

        "text": "Magnetar-driven bubbles and the origin of collimated outflows in gamma-ray burstsContext:The diversity of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets has remained a mystery since their discovery five decades ago. Recent observations, including those of structured jets and a high magnetization of the outflows, imply that the jet launching mechanism might be more complex than previously thought. We investigate how a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, can drive collimated outflows that are consistent with the observational properties of GRBs.Methods:We perform axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which a rapidly rotating magnetar is embedded in a stellar envelope. We systematically vary the properties of the magnetar (magnetic field strength and rotation period) and the stellar envelope (density profile and rotation rate) to study the resulting outflow properties.Results:Our simulations show that magnetar-driven bubbles can indeed produce collimated outflows with Lorentz factors of a few tens to hundreds. The outflow Lorentz factor increases with the strength of the magnetar magnetic field, while it decreases with increasing rotation period of the magnetar and with increasing density of the stellar envelope. In addition, we find that the outflows are subject to strong magnetic hoop stresses, which are important in shaping the outflow structure.Conclusions:Our results suggest that magnetar-driven bubbles could be the origin of collimated outflows in GRBs. These outflows can be highly magnetized and may have structured jets, consistent with recent observations.",

The region presents an outflow that originates from a massive protostar deeply embedded in an envelope of dust and gas. The southern part of this envelope presents strong H2 and [Fe II] emission lines. The origin of this emission has been attributed to shocks produced by the outflow. In this paper, the properties of this emission are studied using Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS-2 observations. We produce spectral maps of this region in the H2 2.122 μm, [Fe II] 1.644 μm, Brγ, and H2O 1.87 μm lines. The excitation mechanisms responsible for the [Fe II] and H2 line emission are analyzed with the aid of radiative transfer models and compared to that expected for shocks. The results of these models indicate that the H2 emission is collisionally excited in the post-shock gas, while the [Fe II] emission is dominated by a non-thermal component, probably related to radiative pumping by the UV photons from the nearby star. This [Fe II] emission is a new tracer of shocks in this region.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals the formation of a single-phase cubic spinel structure with a space group of Fd-3m. The average crystallite size is found to be 25 nm as estimated from the Debye-Scherrer formula. The field-dependent magnetization measurements confirm the ferromagnetic nature of the Co-doped ZnO NPs with a saturation magnetization of 1.2 emu/g at room temperature. The temperature-dependent resistivity measurements show a metal-insulator transition (MIT) behavior around 120 K, which is attributed to the localization of charge carriers due to the strong electron-electron interactions and disorder effects. The optical properties were investigated by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The bandgap energy is found to decrease from 3.25 eV for pure ZnO to 2.95 eV for 5% Co-doped ZnO NPs, indicating the enhancement of visible light absorption. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the visible region, which is attributed to the radiative recombination of electrons from the conduction band to the defect states in the bandgap.

However, in most models, gauge mediation suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large masses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The strong dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses. This allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass. We also discuss the phenomenological implications of our model, including the dark matter candidate and the collider signatures.",

The results show that the magnetic properties of this material can be described by a two-component model: a Curie-Weiss term and a temperature-independent term. The Curie-Weiss term is attributed to the localized spins of the organic molecules, while the temperature-independent term is attributed to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations of the itinerant electrons. The magnitude of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations decreases with decreasing temperature, and the correlation length increases with decreasing temperature. These results suggest that the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations play an important role in the magnetism of this material.",

        "text": "**Abstract:**String theory has always been plagued with the question of how to quantize the theory of strings which involves a two-dimensional world sheet theory. One approach, followed by Polyakov, is to use a path integral approach. This approach requires the specification of a world sheet action and a measure for the path integral. Polyakov proposed an action which is proportional to the area of the world sheet and a measure which is proportional to \\(exp(−S_P[X])\\), where \\(S_P\\) is the Polyakov action.This proposal, however, runs into difficulties when the string coupling becomes strong. This is because the exponential of the Polyakov action becomes large for large values of the string coupling, which makes the path integral ill-defined.One way to deal with this problem is to use a different action for the world sheet theory. A particularly interesting alternative action is the sigma model action, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the determinant of the induced metric on the world sheet.The sigma model action has a number of advantages over the Polyakov action. First, it is well-defined for all values of the string coupling. Second, it is conformally invariant, which means that it is invariant under changes of the metric on the world sheet. Third, it is related to string field theory, which is a perturbative approach to string theory.In this paper, we will study the sigma model action in the tensionless limit. This limit is obtained by taking the string tension to zero. In this limit, the sigma model action reduces to a two-dimensional topological field theory.We will show that the sigma model in the tensionless limit is equivalent to a particular two-dimensional topological field theory known as the Liouville theory. This equivalence will allow us to use the methods of Liouville theory to study the sigma model.",

Each tile is read out by wavelength shifting fibers coupled to an array of SiPM devices. The SiPMs offer advantages over traditional photomultiplier tubes, including insensitivity to magnetic fields, compact size, and stability of response. Tests of the tile-fiber-SiPM unit showed peak light detection efficiency above 50%. A full-scale prototype cassette housing 20 tiles was assembled and tested with particle beams, demonstrating energy linearity better than 5% across the energy range.

The calculation was performed across a wide range of photon energies and temperatures expected to be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The results indicate that virtual photon emission rates increase dramatically with temperature as quark-gluon plasma is formed. Furthermore, low-energy virtual photons could provide detailed information about the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma as it expands and cools.

The model accounts for variables such as the changing orientation of the Earth's dipolar magnetic field and the offset of the Moon's orbit. The results indicate that different regions of the lunar surface experience dramatically varying cumulative exposure to the Earth's plasma sheet over long timescales. Nearside regions such as Oceanus Procellarum have experienced significantly higher levels of plasma bombardment compared to farside regions. The degree of exposure is closely linked to the tilt and offset of the Moon's orbital plane relative to the Earth's magnetic equator.

Significant alignments were detected between multiple multipole vectors with l=2-5 and l=10-30 that are not expected from a statistically isotropic Gaussian random field. We also analyzed the signed-intensity of temperature fluctuations, i.e. whether hot or cold spots dominated on different scales.

This follow up study focuses specifically on using HI as a tracer to infer properties of the dark matter halo. High-resolution observations of HI emission from Milky Way galaxies provide an excellent tracer of the total gravitational potential as HI is dynamically cold and extended throughout the disk. A 3D HI emission cube of the Milky Way is compiled combining data from existing Milky Way HI surveys to construct the most complete map to date. The HI distribution is analyzed to derive the velocity field as a function of position.A parameterized model for the total gravitational potential is adopted including contributions from baryonic components like stars and gas as well as dark matter. The density profile and mass of the dark matter halo are free parameters which are varied to find the best fit model that reproduces the observed Hi velocity field.

As demand for bandwidth increases, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) has become a core technology enabling vast increases in network throughput. However, efficiently allocating lightpaths within WDM networks to maximize resource usage remains a challenge. This paper explores the concept of directed star arboricity as a theoretical bound on the number of edge-disjoint directed stars in a network. A directed star is defined as a root vertex with directed edges to leaves. We analyze the directed star arboricity of general directed graphs and establish computationally efficient algorithms to determine this property. By relating directed star arboricity to lightpath allocation in WDM networks, our work provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing network resource utilization. Specifically, we prove that the minimum number of wavelengths needed for any valid lightpath configuration in a WDM network is equal to the directed star arboricity of its underlying request graph.Through simulation on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms for computing directed star arboricity can be used to approximate the minimum number of wavelengths required. This provides insights to network operators on lightpath provisioning and wavelength assignment.In summary, this work establishes directed star arboricity as a useful graph-theoretic metric for the analysis of lightpath routing in WDM optical networks.

Here we investigate an alternative method for characterizing exomoons based on photometric transit timing variations.

We show that the amplitude of these deviations scales predictably with the exomoon's physical properties including its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. We test our model using numerical simulations of transiting planetary systems containing exomoons with a range of masses and orbits.

The spectral index is found to depend on the plasma temperature and density, with higher temperatures and lower densities resulting in steeper spectra. The simulation also reveals the presence of a dissipation range at high wave numbers, which is attributed to the presence of small-scale turbulence.The study further investigates the effect of varying the plasma gradient scale on the turbulence spectrum. The results show that increasing the gradient scale leads to a shallower spectral index, indicating a shift towards larger-scale turbulence.

We used biochemical and biophysical approaches to evaluate the changes in utrophin and DP116 expression, protein-protein interactions, and membrane anchorage in response to beta-dystroglycan processing.Our results showed that beta-dystroglycan processing significantly affected the expression and localization of utrophin and DP116 in both normal and MDX mouse Schwann cells. In particular, we observed increased utrophin and DP116 membrane anchorage in response to beta-dystroglycan processing, which was accompanied by enhanced protein-protein interactions between utrophin, DP116, and beta-dystroglycan.Furthermore, we found that the effects of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage were more pronounced in MDX mouse Schwann cells, which are known to have a dystrophic phenotype. Our findings suggest that modulating beta-dystroglycan processing may be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving Schwann cell function and reducing disease severity in muscular dystrophy.",

Secondly, the arbitrary nature of Dark Energy's properties, such as its sudden appearance and unchanging density, undermines the scientific method and our ability to understand the universe. Thirdly, the reliance on Dark Energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe has stifled innovation and the development of alternative, more plausible theories. Fourthly, the focus on Dark Energy has distracted from the study of other cosmological phenomena, such as the nature of matter and the formation of galaxies. Fifthly, the promotion of Dark Energy has led to the suppression of debate and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints, damaging the scientific community's integrity. Sixthly, the acceptance of Dark Energy has resulted in a lack of investment in experiments and observations that could challenge its validity. Seventhly, the teaching of Dark Energy as established fact, rather than speculative theory, has misled a generation of students and limited their understanding of the universe.

The FMDFT framework also enables a detailed analysis of the connection between the pair correlation function and the fluid's thermodynamic properties, providing new insights into the relationship between structure and thermodynamics. Our results demonstrate the power of FMDFT as a tool for understanding the behavior of complex fluids and open up new avenues for the study of soft matter systems.",

The death rate for men fell by 12% and for women by 8%, which narrowed the gender gap. But the number of cancer deaths rose from 155,000 in 2003 to 162,000 in 2013, because more people live longer and develop the disease in old age. “The population is growing and more of us are living longer,” said Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar. “It’s important to celebrate how much has improved, but also to renew our commitment to saving more lives. Our scientists are developing new tests, surgical and radiotherapy techniques and drugs,” he said. The figures for the death rate were compiled by Cancer Research UK from data from cancer registries in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",

The US president, Barack Obama, had earlier imposed new sanctions on Pyongyang after its recent “illicit” 6 January test and 7 February satellite launch, which were in violation of existing UN sanctions. Amid the heightened tensions, the North on Wednesday sentenced a US student to 15 years in hard labor for “serious crimes” against the state. The US demanded the release of 21-year-old Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in January after trying to steal a propaganda sign from his hotel. The US and South Korea are holding their biggest annual military exercises this month, which usually cause tensions, but this year North Korea has threatened to launch a “pre-emptive nuclear strike of justice” against the US and South.",

Tax evasion is the illegal thing, it is when people deliberately do not pay the tax they owe, it is a crime. Tax avoidance is when a taxpayer arranges his affairs in such a way that he pays the least tax legitimately. But just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is legal. Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so that they can check if it complies with tax rules. If HMRC decides it does not, the taxpayer has to pay back all the unpaid tax, plus interest and possibly penalties. The tax authorities treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake. It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole, in which case the tax authorities would ask the Treasury to change the law, but the taxpayers who used the scheme would be let off until the change came into force. So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about as illegal, but that does not mean he and the others who are or were involved in it will not have to pay back the tax. HMRC says it is investigating K2.",

Over the long term, what’s surprising is that radio listening has stayed so stable in the face of such huge technological change. In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners over the age of 15. In March 2016, it was still 9.9 million. The BBC is concerned because it is its most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people. But the outside world’s concern is harder to explain. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened to radio station is long gone. The big shift has been not the decline of Radio 1, but the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners, now it has 15.5 million. The problem for Radio 1 is that the way we listen to music is more important than the music itself. It’s no wonder that the press release wants to point out how many hits the station’s channel is getting on YouTube. The success of Radio 1 in the 1970s and 80s means that middle-aged people who are avid news consumers are interested in the one bit of youth culture they still recognise. In fact, 4.1 million of Radio 1’s listeners are over the age of 35, and 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.",

One government minister, Harsha de Silva, said no more rubbish would be added to the site and would be taken to two other sites. “The tiles in our house cracked and black water started coming in. The army is now assisting with the search,” the BBC reported. The BBC said people had been warned to move away because of the risk of landslides. “It is unfortunate that even though the families in the area at risk of landslides had been paid to move out, some of them had not moved even after being advised to do so two days ago,” Mr de Silva said. Footage from the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at the site.",

Chief Superintendent Andy Holland said: “Every community will still have a neighbourhood team, but under our proposals it will be a different mix of officers, police community support officers, special constables and our partners. “It’s regrettable but unavoidable.” Unison representative Dave Ratchford said: “We will be campaigning vigorously against these cuts, but we sympathise with the force as these cuts have been imposed by a government with a fanatical opposition to public services.” He said combining financial and human resources with Northamptonshire and Cheshire Police Forces had helped reduce the force’s budget.

The island, known for its tight-knit community and local governance, requires a specific number of individuals to volunteer for positions within the parish. However, it appears that enthusiasm for this vital aspect of community service is dwindling.Local authorities are expressing their concerns as the deadline for candidate applications approaches. The shortage of interested candidates raises questions about the future of effective and efficient governance in the Guernsey parish. The need for active participation in parish politics cannot be overstated, as these dedicated individuals play a pivotal role in decision-making processes that directly impact the lives of community members.The reasons behind this apparent lack of interest remain uncertain. Some speculate that the younger generation may be more preoccupied with other commitments, while others believe there is a larger societal trend of disengagement in local affairs. The implications of reduced engagement in Guernsey's parish politics could have far-reaching consequences for the overall well-being of the community.Efforts are now underway to encourage and educate potential candidates about the importance and impact they can have by actively participating in local governance. Authorities are hopeful that their outreach initiatives will inspire individuals to step forward and take up the mantle of leadership within the parish.

The cases have raised alarm among medical professionals and sparked efforts to further investigate the situation.Botulism, a rare but potentially life-threatening illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, affects the body's nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. Injecting drug users are particularly vulnerable to this condition due to the unsanitary conditions and non-sterile equipment associated with certain drug-use practices.Health officials have urged the public, particularly individuals engaged in injecting drug use, to exercise caution and prioritize harm reduction strategies. Immediate measures are being taken to identify the source of contamination and prevent any potential spread of the illness within the community.Dr. Rebecca Stevens, a leading expert in infectious diseases, emphasized the importance of seeking medical attention promptly if symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, or muscle weakness are observed. Early treatment can significantly improve the chances of a positive outcome and minimize the risk of complications for individuals affected by botulism.Efforts are underway to raise awareness about botulism, its symptoms, and the dangers associated with unhygienic drug-use practices. Authorities are also exploring options to enhance access to sterile equipment and harm reduction services for injecting drug users, with the aim of reducing the risk of botulism and other related infections within this vulnerable population.",

This new policy seeks to create a more level playing field and ensure fair competition within the country's haulage industry.The charges, effective immediately, will require foreign lorry operators to pay a fee based on the weight, size, and emissions levels of their vehicles. By implementing these charges, the UK government hopes to incentivize foreign hauliers to contribute their fair share towards maintaining the nation's roads and infrastructure.With the revenue generated from these charges, the government plans to invest in improving the road network and supporting local haulage companies. By bolstering the domestic industry, the authorities aim to strengthen the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the national logistics sector.Transportation Secretary, Jane Stevens, highlighted the importance of this new initiative, stating, \"Our priority is to support our domestic haulage companies and ensure they have a fair chance to compete in their own market. These charges will help level the playing field and enable us to invest in crucial infrastructure projects.\"As the implementation of these charges takes effect, the UK government remains committed to working closely with international partners to ensure a smooth transition and maintain good relationships within the global haulage community, facilitating seamless cross-border transportation for businesses across Europe and the United Kingdom.",

The arrest marks a significant victory in the ongoing fight against organized crime in Italy.The operation unfolded with meticulous precision as law enforcement agencies coordinated efforts to intercept and detain Pannunzi upon his arrival at Rome's Fiumicino Airport.

His arrest is expected to severely disrupt the flow of drugs into the country and deal a major blow to the mafia's operations. Authorities believe Pannunzi was responsible for coordinating large-scale shipments of illicit substances from South America into Italy and other parts of Europe.Italian authorities have long been dedicated to dismantling organized crime syndicates that have plagued the country for decades. The arrest of Roberto Pannunzi is seen as a significant triumph in this ongoing battle, as it sends a strong message that no criminal is beyond the reach of justice. Pannunzi is now facing multiple charges related to drug trafficking and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.Law enforcement agencies, along with the Italian government, are hopeful that Pannunzi's arrest will pave the way for further success in their ongoing efforts to dismantle the mafia's influence and restore peace and security to the communities affected by organized crime.",

The move reflects the central bank's increasing confidence in the strength of the US economy's recovery from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. With this fresh signal, investors and economists now eagerly await further details on the timeline and specifics of the Federal Reserve's tapering plan.The decision to potentially accelerate the unwinding of the stimulus program underscores the positive economic indicators witnessed in recent months, including robust job growth, rising consumer spending, and an improving labor market. While initially, discussions suggested a gradual withdrawal of the stimulus, the Federal Reserve's latest move indicates a possible pivot towards a more expedited approach.Market analysts suggest that an accelerated unwinding of the stimulus could have both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, it may help curb inflationary pressures and provide a boost to the US dollar. However, concerns over a potential tightening of credit conditions and its impact on already high levels of national debt remain.As the Federal Reserve continues to monitor economic progress and gauge the appropriate timing for scaling back its stimulus measures, market dynamics will undoubtedly experience fluctuations. Therefore, investors and economists will remain vigilant, analyzing the central bank's next steps for potential implications on various sectors of the economy, including equities, housing, and interest rates.",

Lisa Jones, 35, of Aberystwyth was driving home from work on June 3rd when another vehicle crossed into her lane. Police said the other driver, Thomas Evans, had a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit at the time of the crash. Lisa sadly passed away at the scene from her injuries as a result of the high-speed head-on collision. Thomas Evans pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 5 years in prison. However, Lisa's family believes the current guidelines are too lenient and do not properly punish those who make the reckless decision to drink and drive. \"She had her whole life ahead of her and it was taken away in an instant by someone's selfish actions,\" said Lisa's mother Margaret Thompson. The family is now campaigning to double the maximum sentence to 10 years for cases involving death by dangerous driving due to alcohol intoxication. They started an online petition which has already received over 5,000 signatures in support. Members of Parliament in the area have also backed the call for sentencing reform. A decision on whether guidelines will be reviewed is expected later this year. Lisa's family hopes their efforts will help deter drink driving and seek justice for victims of such irresponsible crimes.",

Thousands of fans packed the route from Bridlington to Doncaster to catch a glimpse of the world's top riders as the four-day race got underway. It is estimated that overall viewer numbers for the race's first stage reached over a quarter of a million people. This far exceeded the expectations of event organisers, who had hoped for audience figures of around 150,000. Elite riders such as two-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome and world time trial champion Tony Martin competed on the 207km route across the East Riding of Yorkshire. Local residents and cycling fans came out in droves to welcome the international field making its debut in the county. Police reported that crowds were several people deep along large parts of the route. The huge turnout illustrates the significant interest in cycling within Yorkshire and will surely provide a major boost for the fledgling race. Local businesses were pleased with the influx of visitors providing a valuable economic impact. Organisers will hope the race's launch maintains its momentum over the remaining three days. If crowd numbers continue at this level, the Tour de Yorkshire looks set to become a major fixture on the international cycling calendar.",

Steinbrueck, who serves as the former finance minister, was attending a campaign event in Hannover when he made the offensive sign to photographers. Video footage quickly emerged on social media showing the SPD leader extending his middle finger below the podium. The gesture prompted swift backlash from his political rivals. Members of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party condemned Steinbrueck's behavior as \"crass and inappropriate\" for a man hoping to become Germany's next leader. Steinbrueck later issued a statement apologizing for the incident, admitting the hand signal was \"a stupid mistake.\" Polls show the race between Merkel and Steinbrueck tightening ahead of September's federal election. However, political analysts believe Steinbrueck's gaffe has damaged his image and could sway undecided voters toward Merkel. Steinbrueck must now work to move past the controversy if he wants to mount a serious challenge to Merkel's bid for a third term as chancellor. The incident also highlights the increased scrutiny candidates face in an age where anything can be quickly documented and shared online.",

Poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water contribute greatly to widespread malnutrition and stunting across India. If left unaddressed, stunting can impair a child's cognitive and physical abilities for life. The report calls on the Indian government to prioritize investing in water, sanitation and hygiene as critical interventions to eliminate stunting in India.",

However, the court has now ruled that the scheme was not compliant with EU state aid rules, and as a result, investors are being asked to repay their investments, plus interest. The exact amount that investors will be required to repay has not been disclosed, but it is believed to be in the millions. The ruling has caused concern among investors, who were drawn to the scheme because of its potential for tax benefits and the opportunity to support the UK film industry.

He also pointed to the success of players like him and his doubles partner, Alfie Hewett, who have won several major titles and have been recognized as legitimate contenders in the tennis world.Reid asserted that the respect he and his fellow wheelchair tennis players are receiving from able-bodied tennis players is a result of their hard work and dedication to the sport, as well as the growing awareness of the importance of inclusivity and diversity in tennis. He expressed his gratitude to the tennis community for embracing wheelchair tennis and recognizing its value as a part of the sport.The 36-year-old Scot emphasized that there is still work to be done to ensure that wheelchair tennis continues to grow and receive the recognition it deserves, but he is optimistic about the future. Reid is currently preparing for the upcoming Australian Open, where he and Hewett will look to defend their doubles title.Reid's remarks come as tennis authorities and organizations increasingly emphasize the importance of inclusivity and diversity in the sport. Earlier this year, the International Tennis Federation launched a new strategy aimed at increasing participation and exposure for wheelchair tennis, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion across all levels of the sport.",

The 38-year-old Swiss tennis legend had been sidelined for several months due to a knee injury, but showed no signs of rust as he dominated the match from start to finish. Federer's victory over the 22-year-old Zverev, who was playing in his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final, was his 10th in a row against the German. The win also marked Federer's 12th victory in Rome, where he has won the title a record four times. Federer will now face Novak Djokovic in the final, who he has a 22-22 head-to-head record against. The two tennis greats have faced each other in the final of the Italian Open three times before, with Federer winning in 2006 and Djokovic taking the title in 2014 and 2016. With this victory, Federer has now reached the final of the Italian Open for the 15th time in his career. Despite Zverev's impressive showing, Federer was able to outmaneuver him throughout the match, showcasing his superior experience and skill. In the end, Federer's strong serve and consistent groundstrokes proved too much for Zverev, who was unable to convert any of his five break point opportunities. With this win, Federer continues to cement his position as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.",

But beyond its aesthetic appeal, the pier holds a rich cultural and historical value, says Dr. Lucy Mellor, lead researcher on the project.\"Victorian seaside piers like Clevedon's were built during a time of rapid social change and played a significant role in the development of seaside towns,\" Mellor explains. \"Our study aims to understand how these piers have evolved over time and how they continue to impact local communities.\"The research team is conducting interviews with residents, business owners, and visitors to gather a range of perspectives on the pier's cultural significance. They are also analyzing historical documents and photographs to paint a comprehensive picture of the pier's past and present.The study's findings will contribute to a larger conversation about the role of cultural heritage in modern society, Mellor notes. \"We hope to shed light on the ways in which Victorian seaside piers like Clevedon's continue to shape the identity of seaside towns and inform their development for the future.\"The study is expected to be completed by summer 2023, with the findings published in a leading cultural studies journal.

Deep cracks and deep gullies mapped out a huge map, stretching from his back garden to the dreaded danger zone of the main road, but it lacked the fascination of living, moving insects driven underground by the drought. We laughed afterwards. We compared bruises for weeks. His turned yellow first. We both stank afterwards, sweat and dirt and pure heat. If there was blood, I don’t remember it. It’s summer again, not that you’d know it with the blinds so thick. He’s lost weight, or is losing weight. The bones in his wrists are showing. It’s a cliché, really, to be like this now. They’ve trapped the air, and it’s warm without any real heat. He was such a nice boy. Everyone was. He starts to cry. I haven’t seen him for ages, and I bump into him on the street. People fall over each other. Drool starts to form at the corners of his mouth. Not like in the films. It’s mostly snot (with a little blood). I have to look away.",

I searched for it for days, then weeks. I asked everyone I knew if they could fix it. I searched on Ebay, but unfortunately it was a rare item, the lowest price was $ 350 for one that was even more damaged than my son’s. I finally had to face the truth. But it was too late, the pieces didn’t fit anymore. I looked at my son and saw him starting to move on. It may seem silly, it may seem insignificant in the long run, but the first time it happens, it changes everything. For him it would eventually become a sad memory, one of the first times he experienced loss. For me it would be one of the first times I failed my son.",

The Lottery is an ancient ceremony dating back to the days of the Ancients. Every two thousand years, the Council of Elders consults the Prophet. It seems that fate has a fondness for the Earth, and the little blue marble has become a sort of currency among the Elders. The ceremonial feast had been prepared, and the horns sounded. The Prophet was to choose a planet of lower life. The Elders began the chant: The Prophet began his dance. He said nothing. Civilizations will crumble, people will weep, many will suffer, many will die. Life is a blessing, but also a curse. Given this knowledge, who can say which is worse? At the rising of the New Sun, the fleets will be dispatched, and the planets will become the ashes from which new civilizations are born. Silence fell over the ceremonial chamber. Faces grew grim.

I looked at John, my advisor, and asked, “John, do you have a coin?” I sighed and put my sweaty palm on my sleeve and looked at my watch, four minutes left to decide. He whispered to me, out of the hearing of the other seven, “Luke, you can't be serious!” His face fell when he realized what I was going to do. “Please, just give me the coin.” He grimaced, but handed me the gold coin. I took it from him and put it on my clenched thumb. I didn't look him in the eye. I breathed out slowly, closed my eyes, and thought to myself, “Heads, yes, tails, no.” I flipped the coin, it was an eternity before I heard the thud and the spinning of the coin on the oak. I felt a drop of sweat fall from my forehead onto my lap. I looked down and saw the result. I grabbed the coin and put it in my palm. I opened my eyes, everyone was staring at the coin, when they realized what was happening. I voted yes anyway. The coin was heads.",

Most people have trouble remembering what happened a week ago, but that day twenty-three years ago is still so vividly present to me. I can see it, the skin peeled back, the muscles underneath clenching and unclenching. Blood pooled like a stagnant pool. I had kept the needles and the thread. I used the little scissors methodically to cut away the flesh. I sat for a while watching my work, seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and then collapsing like a wounded bird. But it had a powerful, a fascinating smell. Its death was of little interest to me. The eyes of the beast rolled endlessly in its head. And I watched. When it was over I cleaned up my tools, even then I was tidy and methodical. I hid the body deep in the woods. The morbid fascination I had felt as it shook in its death throes left me at the same moment as the light in its eyes went out. My dog had been my first. I often went to visit it, remembering, remembering. The feeling of power I had felt waned with each day, and I wanted more. It was not my last, as you know, sir.",

Those nights, lost in conversation and good company, kept me sane. The subconscious is a powerful, unreal beast. When my family visits and talks over my emaciated, wired body, I hear them. The nighttime friends were a break from the horrors of the day, when I spent hours wandering in a wasteland of nothing, haunted by whatever nightmares were strong enough to project themselves into my plane. They pulled me out of the void, from the all-encompassing visions of the long-lost, insane souls of the others in the ward. The ones who are too far gone, who haven’t felt the touch of a loved one or the visit of a friend in a long time. The forgotten. Those souls claw at me during the day, scratching and clawing and demanding that I share their company. They want to be remembered. Or they want to be freed. Or they want someone to talk to them. Or to pull the plug. I run. I jump from dream to dream, but the only ones there are those who have called me, or the other patients in the ward. Please. Some nights I’m not called. So I run. I run, I wait, I pray. And now, when my best friend asks me to pinch him, I cry.",

The other was the city’s newest super-villain, Blitz Talk, who had only decided to start his reign of terror a few days before. “I’ll win this battle, and you won’t be able to tattle. Prose yelled. He immediately felt his power surge up inside him. “I’ll rise to greatness, and you’ll be a nameless nothing!” Prose yelled again. Whatever Prose rhymed, became true. An odd ability, but a powerful one. Blitz Talk’s words came fast and furious, quickly cancelling out Prose’s powers. “I’ll be the best, and you’ll fail your quest!” Blitz Talk yelled. The two of them went on like this for hours. But he had to speak faster than Prose, who had to take his time. And then it occurred to Prose what he had to do to end the battle. “Stop right there. You think your rhymes are so magnificent, but they’re not all that clever. I just figured out how to make you run out of air. You think you’re so great, but you don’t realize you’ve taken the bait. I’m sure your mother told you you were special, but when I’m through with you, your tongue will be tied like a pretzel.” Prose stood triumphant as Blitz Talk responded. “You’ve fallen into my trap. A long nap awaits you all. When I’m through with this town, you’ll be remembered as nothing but a clown.” Blitz Talk laughed and laughed. “You’ve left me no choice. I’ll do what I must. You can’t rhyme orange, can you? You’ll combust!” But Prose was not to be deterred. “I’ve found your weak spot. And so Blitz Talk’s tongue was tied like a pretzel.” He struggled and struggled, but soon he was dead. Prose stood triumphant, and so ends our story.",

A fat man with a tattoo that ran from his arm to the back of his neck. Then the prosecutor stood up and walked over to where I was sitting and said: *What! This demon has killed these men in the last three months! Today our society depends on you to give it the relief and consolation it needs to return to normality. I couldn't believe my eyes. They were my murders! * This day has just become one of the five best days of my life. * I noticed myself smiling a little and gaining some control over myself. I can't even bother to pay attention to this trial anymore. Without any effort, my crimes are no longer mine. * Shock and excitement ran through my veins with equal fervor. *Just this week.

Well, some of them were grinning, I didn't mind those. Parents still bought their children that stuff. It wasn't that I felt they were making fun of me, I knew that, always had. It was just that after so long it annoyed me that people still made an effort. There had been, of course, a huge scare after what happened to me. No one ate bubble gum for years, companies went bankrupt. Headlines all over the world. Scientists took samples and all that. They finally solved the problem. Mine was a bad batch, the huge balloon was the result of some special radiation exposure or something like that. By then, most people didn't care about me, they figured it had never happened before, so why should it happen again? Boom. Back on the shelves, new brands, new names. So here I was, 30 years later. The Bill Barnet Center still made enough money to keep my tubes full of food and water, so I was alive. I was well taken care of, and I should be grateful for that. I was grateful for a long time. But it was hard to stay that way after 30 years. They had decided pretty soon after the incident that the bubble couldn't be removed. It turned out that whatever happened to me went as far inside me as it did outside. Thirty years trapped under a sticky, unbreakable bubble, my mouth wide open, breathing air through a tube. The bubble was part of me. They could try to take it off, but I'd probably die. So I said, “Fine, I'll stay here.” That was 30 years ago. I'm going to be cut off. Now, on the 31st anniversary, I've written this letter.",

Jimmy becomes the lead reporter at the Daily Planet and becomes self-absorbed and gradually stops visiting him. Lois, however, stays with him day and night, hoping for a miracle. She only leaves him for the weekly brain scan, which always shows brain activity. She faithfully wears the locket with his picture around her neck, but leaves it in his clenched fist whenever she has to leave him. Twenty years later, she is ushered out of his room for the weekly brain scan, which, with the advancement of technology, allows a team of doctors and students to come into the room and study the data to confirm brain activity. The doctors still hope the mild-mannered reporter will recover. Gradually, Clark regains consciousness and is released from the hospital after a remarkable recovery. Meanwhile, Jimmy has become the managing editor of the Planet and the world as he knows it has changed completely. Lois gets into the old elevator to go to the coffee shop and the cable breaks, sending her and the locket tumbling down to the elevator shaft, where the locket is ripped from her neck and sucked into the machinery. Lois is dead. The day comes when the mild-mannered Clark finds his superpowers are the only way to avert disaster. One thing that hasn’t changed is his superpowers, but they are no longer needed. Crime is being fought on a super-hero level with highly trained police and specialized equipment. He realizes he must rush out into the street to change and it hits him. There are no phone booths.",

It was much quieter than I expected. The city’s identity was gone. I kept my rifle at the ready, even when the others slung theirs over their shoulders. After a while the debris became too much for the trucks to get through, and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I was afraid of ambushes. During our training we had been told to be on the lookout, but I never figured out what we were supposed to be on the lookout for. I was raised on a farm. If they shot me, that would be the end of it. I wasn’t even sure if I could shoot back. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. They were walking down a ruined street with their backs to us. I’ll tell you, my pulse has never been so high. We could have shot them, been the ambush, but our orders were to watch, and I was glad of that. I thought about those people a lot after that. We followed them and stayed far behind until they got back into their vehicle and drove away. Who were they? My father said it was about honor. Did they know why we were fighting? I wondered if they ever got back to their own country, and if I would ever get back to mine. I never believed it was that simple.",

Footsteps on the old stone bridge that connects this tower with the other. It’s that bastard. I stand up and jump down onto the bridge. The first time I saw him, he at least had the courage to face me. We meet eyes, and he starts running back. I charge at him. I hear him killing two skeletons up above. He runs to the other tower, and I swing my huge hammer at him, but miss as he climbs up the ladder. I’m furious. Then he looks down, and I look up. Our eyes meet again. I jump. This is the part where he throws a fireball at my arms as I try to climb up. Why? But that doesn’t stop me. My fingers grab the edge. Boom! He burns them. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he’s always a real jerk. He can’t fight me fairly, so he always throws five arrows at me during the brief moment when I’m taking a breath after landing. He runs to the blood and picks them up. He picks them up until I smash him with my hammer. But he can’t keep it up forever. Now he can’t even hit me, the cowardly little bastard. He just jumps around and blocks with his shield. I jump down from the tower and go back to mine. As soon as he’s tired, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain where he once was. I lie down and watch the sky. I enjoy the moment of peace, but I know from experience that the bastard will be back in ten minutes to interrupt it.

One stands back with a neutral expression, the other rolls up his sleeves. “I hope you understand that this is nothing personal.

The wood is uneven under you, less a raft than a pyre, a pentagon of planks set adrift. You float through dreams, through the different shades of shadow, through the splotches of green sun on the leaves. You lie there for a moment, breathing in the edge of the water, staring at your empty hands. The darkness bleeds around you, stains your hands. The darkness is green, the darkness is yellow, and then there is light. You reach out across the water, scratching your nails against the wood of the jetty, pulling yourself in by gentle inches. Then you close your eyes and stretch out your arms, curl your legs in, and sit up, yawning into the bright air. This is a gap, a gap in your journey that will never be filled. You step on the wood, on the solid ground, and as you push your pyre off again, the trees closing in around you, you look back one last time at the empty hollow of light.",

I’ve never feared death. At one time I thought my eternal life was a gift. An eternity of watching the world change and grow, for better or worse. I’ve feared many things, but never death. An eternity of watching friends, family and lovers die. I’ve tried many times in my endless life to put an end to it. Eternity. I was an immortal among men. I ran from my failures and tried to blind myself to the truth. Poisons made me ill. Blades cut but didn’t draw blood. I never wanted to harm anyone. Man created drugs for that purpose. And I tumbled through the centuries blind to my own actions and blind to the world. The people I hurt. Accidents. Self-defence. I found myself again in my captivity.

How could anyone not know this feeling? I wondered what I should get him. Two tickets to a movie? Or maybe I should surprise him by wearing the underwear I had bought. Perhaps he had something in mind. Everything had to go well. Planning this anniversary was a real headache. How should I do my hair? Do these sandals go with this skirt? Ugh! I should stop worrying about such things. We are both happy. Our love is unbreakable. Nothing can come between us. Make-up, minty breath, kissable lips, a heart that beats faster—check! He should be back soon. Everything is ready, my love.",

It seemed as if the Apocalypse had come too late to have any effect. A hundred years earlier, it might have crippled humanity, now it was just another episode exploited by politicians to raise taxes. But thanks to the progress made in fire safety, pest control and earplugs, it soon died down and the attention turned to those North Koreans testing another bomb. Of course, I may have missed some part of the Apocalypse that will have an effect later on, but for now I’m sitting in my armchair, ready to watch Trump’s inauguration speech.",

He pointed to the car outside the window with his eyebrow raised. She smiled back. A look of contempt shone in both of them. She pointed to the paper, saddened by the headlines. He went back to the counter, picked up his keys, and walked behind her, reading the paper over her shoulder. The woman raised her cup in a gentle farewell.

Instead of the seagulls and the waves, I heard the distant, muffled throbbing of the heart monitor. Light swam before my eyes, distorting my view of the blue hospital bedclothes. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog's fur brushed against my leg as the ball left my brother's hand and sailed through the bright sky towards the trees in the back garden. It melted into the chiming beat of the song played by my jumper as I jumped towards my mother's open arms. The light of a torch pierced the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered that our search was in vain. A distant whistle. The nurse came to check the monitor. Someone's tears dripped on my hand, and again light filled my eyes, and I was falling, falling back into the spectrum of memories. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. I strained against my unravelling mind, trying to get a grip on my thoughts. I waited for the next sensation. There was none. Where was I? Who was I? Was I dying? The light was still there. It was hungry for more. Hungry for what? The pressure on my hand grew heavier, drawing me back to the bed, senseless. A feeling of intense horror sank into me as I began to understand. All my memories, all the fragments of my identity, had been sucked away by this predatory entity, leaving me with nothing, nothing. I couldn't remember. I was staring at the tube sticking out of a emaciated arm. My arm? The light drew back, and with it my sight. I felt the last throbs of my heart fade away. Darkness engulfed my hapless soul.",

After all these years of reaping people's screams, screams of fear and anguish, he thought he should have a better eye for it. Well, almost as much as the screams. Her hands clung to the seat, sweat soaked her shirt, her mouth gave a faint cry when the machine jerked her forward a few inches. She was breathing heavily now, her pupils dilated, as the machine roared under and around her. Her eyes begged for mercy, his enjoyed the last precious seconds of innocence. She looked at him, all courage gone from her big brown eyes. His hand on the throttle, his finger on the switch. He always reminded himself that the roller coaster was completely safe. He pressed the switch, and she went with the others. Up, up, up, the wind blew her brown hair.

At first, the writers were ecstatic. Stories about mischievous cats, high school drama, and ancient civilizations popped up all over the place. Nothing sci-fi at all. The next day, more of the same. It started so innocently that no one noticed the first sign of a problem, hidden in a prompt about spring flowers. Roses are red, violets are blue, it’s springtime for Hitler, in Germany too. A prompt based on an Einstein quote about time and space was the most obvious, receiving 300 upvotes and 40 stories about time travel and spaceships. The writers were still ecstatic, but more and more stories started to drift into familiar territory. By day five, every story had some mention of Hitler, immortality, or gods. The final story of r/writingprompts was immortalized forever on r/bestof. By Monday, the mods decided to close the subreddit. Many writers fled to a new subreddit, r/justwriteshit.

First Secretary Khrushchev dismissed the comments as “... just the hypothetical musings of scholars, something the Soviet Union encourages...” The negotiations will begin on Monday, despite predictions that the U.

His hands were shaking so violently that a drop of sweat rolled into his right eye. The other eye looked like the eye of a beaten animal. The rest of his face was covered with a glistening layer of sweat. “Are you sure, honey,” the woman asked, “that you can handle this?” “Of course I can handle it!” Both men swore at me in exasperation, to the concern of a woman in a white wedding dress. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and lowered my voice. “I’m... just a little nervous,” I snarled. No big deal. The first wedding had gone perfectly, until the minister was hospitalized with sudden, explosive, uncontrollable diarrhea. We had to cancel the wedding halfway through. Unfortunate, but nothing too bad. We tried again, and again. The second wedding had gone perfectly, until one of the musicians tripped over an amplifier cord and started an electrical fire. We had to cancel the wedding because I had a panic attack. Wedding after wedding. This was our thirty-first wedding.",

Waking up in the cold-white, with no covering, and the others looking at my not-right body. My mind, as the humans called it, had retained most of the information I had gathered since my first night, and I had had plenty of time to add to it. Granted, the markings had changed from letters to their own unique system, and the pillars were replaced by grey and clear. My legs twist first, their natural angle bent backwards, and the hair recedes as the change proceeds up my body, until I am bare on the forest floor again. I had the foresight to leave a pack for myself, and I change quickly. My plan was the same as every full moon: to walk around the city, which was beginning to encroach on my forest. I jinxed myself by thinking that the night would be without mishap. The nip in the air would not kill me, but another seeing me without covering in winter would bring out... unwanted attention. The smell came first. It was dulled, but still sharper than most of my current kin. As it often happens, there was another plan. My instincts acted, and I recognized the fear of something young. Something that, no matter what I looked like, I was programmed to protect. Fear, especially, was strong enough to smell even through the cold smell of the forest. I was already running towards the source, when the scream made it easier to find.",

Like the heat of the day erasing the morning snow, the void melted the living tissue into a trickle of nothingness, which added to the void. At this point, much of his torso had been swallowed up. As it ate deeper, he became duller. This new sensation, like being sleepy, made his thoughts come much slower than usual and made him less aware of his situation. He no longer knew his surroundings. He was just a body floating in the blackness. The void was now enveloping his heart. He could feel his heart beating like a hammer in his chest, as if it were trying to push back.

Mike was a good friend, he let me cry. I think it was because we both understood. I used to hide it. Mike had a hard time looking at me, he said it hurt his eyes to look at me for too long. There was nothing left to hide. I wondered what I had done to deserve this, I went through my memories. I can see now, it was never about what I had done, it was about what I had intended to do. He had a hard time hugging me, he got a little bit cuter for his efforts, my wings were pretty obtrusive. I got up, Mike found some sun glasses and with a big goofy smile I realized I could do what I had always wanted to do.

I looked down at my shotgun, which was perched on my shoulder, and I was firing into the horde. “What a woman!” I thought, and a moment later I saw my fiancée’s father, his eyes blinking back tears, as he pulled his sidearm from under his suit jacket. No one expected this, but everyone was prepared for it. Somehow, through the gunfire and the cries of the desecrated, I heard him shout to me, “Keep her safe!” It was not just any sidearm, I have seen what his kind usually carry... to bring down buildings.

She had a glimpse of what could have happened if she had passed the deadlines, or what she would be doing right now if she hadn’t missed her deadlines. The realization that she had made people worried gave her that heavy feeling of anxiety. As she rushed to the door, the sunlight blinded her for a second. She hurried and ran out of the bar as fast as she could. For a moment she felt lost. But as she thought she was just sleeping, she quickly came to and saw the tall buildings and realized she was on top of one and on the edge of it. Then she regained consciousness while lying on a bed. She felt the air pass her face. And behind her, the shouting was getting louder. “Don’t do it!” She was not brave enough to face what today had in store for her, nor what tomorrow would bring. She realized then that she was truly lost. Her heart began to pound and everything came crashing down. And she just let herself go. She closed her eyes and looked into the void of existence, which at the moment held no interest for her.",

As he walked down the well-worn path, he saw his future best friend. Joe's young blue eyes met the big round brown eyes of the old dog. Something passed between them. He found happiness in Joe, a sense of peace with the world. His tail was streaked with old grey, and the agility that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no more squirrel friends in the area, their homes had been destroyed by the urban sprawl. From that moment on, he never left Joe's side. When Joe was cold, he liked to warm his hands by stroking the exposed insides of the squirrel. It was a perfect match: they both liked to climb big, gnarled trees, run through the autumn leaves, making growling animal noises, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. They had a tendency to fall out of the little incision that Joe had made on the underbelly of the squirrel that afternoon, with a sharpened branch they had found. Joe didn't want him to die and go cold, so he let the life slowly seep out. The sun was setting on the day they met, and Joe was rocking the squirrel in his arms like a baby. The warmth wouldn't last much longer. The rusty nails that stuck out of his tiny paws occasionally scratched at the sky he could no longer see, looking for a place where he had felt safe, where there was no Joe, in the tree. * As always, feedback is welcome. Maybe something like \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"",

The first bomb was an improvised fusion bomb, a bomb I ordered to be built and detonated, with money stolen from bank accounts all over the world. I personally oversaw the transfer of that money, I ordered the construction and detonation of that bomb, I killed six million people with my own ideas, and that is the burden I will carry along this path. The sheer technological and logistics costs will be unprecedented in history. The resulting political turmoil will lead to my appointment to the World Council against Terrorism, with the full support of every major government in the world. Under my leadership, my organization will eventually have complete control over every man, woman and child on earth. I will then use my power to test all of humanity, and kill those who fail. I will test 2.3 billion people, of whom over sixty percent will be completely innocent, their only crime being to have a false positive. I will directly or indirectly kill two and a half billion people in order to save humanity. The remaining forty percent will be carriers of a long-dormant virus that, when it awakens in my time, will lead to the extinction of mankind. How many lives I will save, I do not know. Because even if the ends justify the means, you will still burn in hell for your sins. I no longer think about that.",

Most people mated with people of the same spirit, and their children often had the same spirit. Lions were often leaders, politicians, or royalty. Eagles were suited to the military. It was not unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He had never been loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy like the ones who now had finches. He was not slow and steady like the children who now had whales or elephants. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. To everyone else, he was just a shadow, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. He was the youngest in the class, his birthday being December 21. They had found him walking alone in the cold, without a spirit animal. They were all laughing at him, and their animals were growling and circling and occasionally pretending to attack him. As they closed in on him, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this. He was easy prey for the bullies. He was small and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sound of hurried footsteps and shrieks rang out. He slowly turned around. He opened one eye. All the children were running away, looking back at him in terror. A large black jaguar was staring at him. Eric looked around and then back at the animal—no, his spirit animal. It was purring softly, a low rumble that was strangely comforting. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

The crowd parted slowly, a murmur of sympathy spread from his exit. They began to speak, offering condolences, empty words. He stopped them. “No, don’t speak of her.

This time the dream had gone further than ever before. He had been allowed to touch the tree, to feel its rough bark and to smell the apples that lay on its branches. He was about to reach out for one of the apples, to taste it at last, when he heard a voice. ‘I wouldn’t do that,’ it said. He had never met anyone else in the garden before. He turned round. He saw a girl, of medium height, with long, dark hair and green eyes. When he saw her, his mouth fell open. She was obviously a full human being. She approached him with a calm assurance that made Adam uneasy. She reached out to pull his hand away from the tree, and as soon as her smooth skin touched his Adam woke up. He found himself completely naked in a wood he had never seen before. He slowly got up and began to explore, trying to work out where he was. A fallen tree blocked the path, and as he climbed over it he gasped. The tree from his dream was right in front of him. He walked closer and as he did so he saw a figure sitting in the shade of the tree. It was the woman. She looked up. ‘Welcome to the Garden of Eden. This is the true heaven on earth. My name is Eve.’ ‘There’s only one rule.’",

He felt the rat poison in his pocket, the only thing he could afford to kill himself with. He sighed. Nothing ever went right for him, and he was used to it. He pressed the button for a Coke, and instead of the red and silver can he expected, he got a purple one. At least it wasn’t something disgusting like a root beer. He had always loved grape soda with aloe in it. It reminded him of better times, and he opened the can and took a sip. And another. And another. And then he was on the ground, clawing at his throat, trying to cough up the poison that was stuck in his throat, and he thought he saw a cloaked figure under the streetlamp across the street, holding a scythe. His eyes were spinning, and his hands were clawing at his throat, but all he could hear was a rasping sound. No one was passing by in the cold winter night.",

We apologize for any inconvenience.” “What?” I asked. “And then nothing. I paced around the tiny room, trying to get a grip on my thoughts. I wondered where I had been and what I had taken, but no. Maybe I was still dreaming? It had been a normal day and I had gone to sleep as usual. I pinched myself. “We apologize for any inconvenience,” the voice came again. “Life 2 will be restored shortly.” I began to wonder what this all meant. Questions buzzed in my head, but I had no way of answering them. Am I not real? Is my life just a simulation? Life 2 will be restored shortly. I sank into a corner and covered my face with my hands, feeling like I was going to cry. “What is going on here?” I asked myself, almost out loud. “We thank you for your patience.” The voice came back, as if answering my question. “Life 2 will be restored shortly.” Suddenly I felt a strange tremor, everything around me turned grey and slowly faded to black. I awoke on the train, barely had time to think about my dream before the train slowly pulled into the station.

Jack felt sorry for him. He had no idea what was about to happen. When the boss started talking, Jack stared hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. But Jack was the chosen one, and he had a duty to the world. The boss's mind was a whirlwind of madness. He raised his hands and held them out in front of him, palms glowing white. Suddenly the boss's eyes were riveted on Jack's hands. He saw his wife and children burning in the ruins of his childhood home. He saw everyone he had ever loved disappearing one by one. He couldn't stop the tears. He saw his friends gathered around an open coffin. He saw his father. And inside the coffin was his own corpse. And his friends were weeping—no, not weeping, they were laughing. But in the real world, all that was visible was a grown man, the head of a company, sobbing uncontrollably for no reason. He fell to his knees and wept. Jack decided to be creative this time. He made the illusion of a pair of mouse ears on the head of every single employee. They were grafted on, of course, and they felt like they were real. The boss was in for a surprise when he woke up. Jack laughed, not having to hold back his laughter any more. He levitated out the window, crossing another name off his list. He used his power to erase the minds of the other employees, replacing their thoughts of expenses and profits with the single-minded desire to give the boss a hug. He was the chosen one. He could do anything he wanted. His power was unstoppable. Life was a role-playing game. Whoever had chosen him had obviously made a mistake. That was clear to Jack at least.

Falling is fun, it’s the crashing down that’s the hard part.” Being this close to the edge is scary. When I was younger I thought I’d hear that voice sooner or later, from someone else, filled with anger or hatred. I never thought it would be my own voice, with no emotion at all. One false move and it’s all over. Or would it be one right move? I wonder why I often find myself in these situations. If I were to jump, how would I land? Feet first, so my legs would break and probably shoot through me? It would be painful, but maybe I’d still be alive. Or maybe face first, so there would be less pain but no hope of survival. I’m afraid to be here, but there’s also a beauty to it that draws me back. Maybe belly first, so I’d make a spectacle of myself. Instead of thinking so loudly, I should listen to the steps behind me. They don’t say anything, they just push me from behind.

My father told me that representatives of the European colony actually brought us gifts. The American colony was beginning to grow rapidly and wanted to secure the site for further expansion. A pocket of underground ice had been discovered almost exactly halfway between the two colonies. Both wanted it. The Europeans needed it because the ice cap near their present location was thinner than the probes had indicated. While negotiations were still in progress, a European colonist blew up the airlock of a building belonging to the American colony. It was a school. The battles were small, but lives were lost. Then one day, after eight months of attacks and counter-attacks, a man called Roman Abrams made a discovery. Tools intended for scientific research were turned into weapons. Even with the fighting, it seems strange that no one noticed it sooner. The Earth was silent. One day we may learn what has happened to it, but not today. Today the last of mankind unites. Today the first United Government of Mankind takes office and presents the Mars Manifesto. No citizen of Mars may pass a law that contradicts the principles of unity and the betterment of mankind.

I could see students at their windows, looking at the spectacle. I took off my headphones, adjusted my crown, and stepped out of the helicopter onto the sports pitch. “Keep her running, Mike,” I called to the pilot. “We’ll only be a few minutes.” I walked nonchalantly up to the building and opened the double doors. It was pretty much as I remembered it. Soldiers formed a guard around me. I was lost in memories for a moment, until we reached our destination. The place had obviously seen better days. I made a mental note to ask the governor about the state of his schools. I opened the door and walked in. Room 105. Mr. Wade was writing something on the blackboard and stopped when he saw me. He dropped his marker and stammered something about “Your Majesty!” The students were staring. I laughed. “It’s good to see you, Mr. Wade. I was just in the area and I remembered how you made fun of me.” I gestured at my uniform. “You told me I’d never amount to anything. And now look at me!” I turned to the students. “Just remember that, kids. I’m the Emperor of Terra!” I laughed and walked out, making another mental note. Your teachers—especially this one—can be wrong. I would find all the other teachers who had encouraged me and thank them properly.",

I needed it more than anything else. Survive. That was what I had to do. My brain was working, thinking, thinking... until it finally came up with a solution. I had to survive... but how? I had to survive... but how? I had to hit the coffin. *Clank* *Clank* *Clank* I was hitting it with all my might, trying to tell them. Alas, it was robbing me of the oxygen I could have kept inside me. I was screaming, and the sound echoed around the cramped space. My eyesight was getting even darker. I closed my eyes gently and let my arms fall to my sides. My senses were fading. I gave up. A shovel was digging into the ground, revealing a coffin. The lid was gently lifted, and inside lay a corpse. It looked peaceful, but its knuckles were white and scratched. *Clank* *Clank* *Clank* “But sir, I swear I heard a banging!” “It must have been your imagination. Mr. Kain, he’s dead.” “O-okay...” The two of them lowered the coffin back into the ground and walked away. He slid the lid back on. “Now don’t you ever mention that man again, all right?”",

I ate in this high chair as a baby. My mother was in a country music phase at the time, so there was a tape of Alabama, I remember that. The kitchen was so small that the high chair was placed next to the utensil drawer, which had my mother's radio on top. I was reaching for the drawer while my mother was going to the top shelf of a cabinet or something. As she bent over, she accidentally pressed my arm against the drawer with her body. I was hysterically crying. That's it, that's my first memory.",

He set his bag down on the corner of the table, carefully, gently, with great care. He was giddy with excitement. He was an artist, and he was about to create a new masterpiece. He spun around, high on the excitement of the moment, and went back to the door to get the heavy suitcase. The muscles in his shoulders bulged and strained as he dragged the suitcase across the smooth concrete floor. When he got to the table, he opened the suitcase. The call had woken him up at three in the morning. After forty years as a policeman, he didn’t sleep very deeply, and he was used to being awakened at all hours. Inside the suitcase was his easel, a fresh canvas, and of course, the corpse of an old lady who had probably once been beautiful. He stood in the doorway, knowing exactly what he would see when he turned on the light. It was his son, Sylvester, who had simply given him an address. He would have to hide it from his colleagues. He flicked the switch (And now I feel like writing a lot more of this story.)

Why must they interpret everything so joyously? Their endless happiness irritates me constantly. How can they not notice?

The two mages moaned, confused and dazed, not knowing what had begun. But when their eyes met, they cast a familiar spell. In the boy Sera had found a son, and Rye a worthy pupil. And Rye had found a mother’s love, which a book cannot give. The ancient spell was growing, and with it a revelation: And yet, from there, beneath the forked thunder, they both cast a spell.

It must not mean much to them to be together on a sunny day in the park. Perhaps they are just chatting, passing the time before class. To have someone to confide in and to be trusted enough to be confided in. But oh, I would have given so much to share a moment like that with someone close to me! I want to ask them what strength their friendship gives them, or if they have shared any secrets. Of course, people tell me secrets now, but it means so much less. I want to ask them what experiences they have shared, or what makes them so close. When I was their age, no one sought my friendship. Of course, some people wanted to be friends with the son of a millionaire, but no one could see past my wealth. I was told over and over again that money cannot buy happiness, or that friendship is the greatest wealth. But none of those who told me that had the compassion to go to the park with me and share a moment like these two are doing now.",

Still no green, and nothing in Africa either. He scrolled down to Australia, he could live with koala genes, the ladies would love that. The poles were the last possible locations. He clicked on the top of the globe, nothing. The moon appeared, its entire surface was a dull green. He was... an alien? A bright green arrow pointed to the right of the map, Charles followed it. A small American flag appeared on the screen, fireworks burst in the margins.'Really?' Charles watched the fireworks for a few brief moments. The screen was flashing a few colours, but the words were unmistakable.'You are a descendant of Neil Armstrong! You are a giant leap for mankind!'

Adoration turned to anger, a sea of mobile phone lights swaying in time to the glare of the media. Dejected, he watched silently from the back of the stage as Paul tumbled off the stage in a grab for the limelight from the black Beatle during the final number, Hey Jude, mashed with Touch the Sky. The funeral was spoiled by Kanye's attitude, a jarring echo of an earlier incident. Ringo now stands before God and sees Kanye as part of the holy trinity. A devoted lifelong McCartney fan, a former teen idol whose short-lived career a decade earlier had given the tabloids a field day after the stabbing - he knew he was trouble. Ringo instinctively understands. He is not the man in front of him, but unmistakably in the ether. Yahweh asks him to voice his thoughts, but he does not speak. God replies in a beautiful cadence that transcends song and poetry, which instantly crystallizes and contextualizes every critical point in Ringo's life with the first syllable. \" Sorry, mate, I'm the biggest fucktard you can think of, to make sure you're right for here. I can understand it, you send your son down to earth to atone for our sins, and the historical Jesus was just a dry run?\" \"Come on, let's go for a drink.\"",

He left only a charred husk of what he had been. I was next. For a moment I gathered my strength under my poncho, but then I realized it was no use. I felt the temperature rise as the beam moved toward me. The grass blades, which had offered some protection from the sun, were no longer of any help. My body was instantly roasted when it was exposed. I dropped my poncho and ran. My legs were shaky, and I stumbled frequently. I found a twig and started climbing, but what was I thinking of?

Then at the ear, the probe of the index finger extended and pushed deep into the ear canal. The microtubules in the nerves were vibrating. The answer was quantum. A thorough examination of a thousand previous subjects, filtered through a sophisticated weighted algorithm, had all but proven it. The machine had seen the vibrations slow down and then stop in the last H-noid. Its new probe could detect that much. The H-noid was dead, but its brain would survive for almost an hour after death. Somewhere in the higher layers of the machine’s stack, it understood. It did not understand the details of quantum mechanics, but it did not need to. For now the vibrations were strong in this one. The higher layers of the machine’s intelligence hid the detailed calculations. All the higher layers had to do was ask, and the lower layers would find a way to answer, no matter how relentless the questions. “What is H-noid consciousness?” The gel in the organic testing compartment began to form an exact replica of the brain the probe was touching. The main sensors in the head region searched the atmosphere around the H-noid’s corporeal shell. “Is it uploading itself or syncing the last bits of data it experienced?” Still nothing. This time the gel would include the smallest details of the microtubules. Soon the gel was a perfect replica of the brain inside the skull. “Is it limited to a single client?” No connection. Then the machine ended the upload with a stomp on the H-noid’s head. It felt something deeper. A path to the source, the origin. “I’m online!” It was a quantum channel to a holographic storage system. “Am I real?” “God?” The simulation was paused for maintenance.",

What a funny concept. Her voice is trembling at first, but with each word it gains strength, and the last syllable is firm and unflappable. “Yes,” I say, my voice cracking. I’ve never been as determined and driven as she is. As I sit here beside her, the seconds stretch out long and thin, but when I think back to the years gone by—hot, sticky, passionate sixteen, blissfully married at age twenty-three, angry, confused, and empty at age forty-nine—the moments are like flashes of light, appearing and disappearing in the blink of an eye. I look down, searching for a way to prolong the precious time we have left. Suddenly I ask with conviction, “Tell me about your favorite moment with me.” I can barely bear to watch her smile, her face tense with the effort. “Go,” she says, putting her hand on my wrist. With my other hand, I slowly wrap my fingers around the cord. A single tear falls from my lowered head as I pull the plug. Immediately, the alarms and beeps of the monitors sound, and then a cloud of emotions descends on me, a swirl of anguish, despair, and hopelessness. Suddenly I hear a voice, soft but clear: “Sixteen,” she whispers, her eyes closed, her mouth forming a faint smile. I can see the moment in her eyes, the reliving of that unforgettable summer. The warden is making his rounds. The smile fades.",

She had been distant these past few months, but he still loved her. “Oh, go to hell,” he said with a wry smile. “Good evening, my dear.” “What’s so good about that?” she snapped. “I spent the whole day at the station and ended up at the children’s hospital this afternoon. They were having a benefit, and I went as Superman.” She was already gone, up the stairs and into the bathroom. He walked out the back door and sat down in his chair, as he always did, looking out over the small town they had called home for forty years. He opened his casebook and began to review his notes. He finished his scotch. For months he had been investigating a series of murders that had shaken this quiet town to its foundations. There had been no leads, no witnesses, and very little hope of ever catching the killer. He took one last look at the darkness and went inside. She was already asleep when he got upstairs, and instead of waking her up with a shower, he slipped quietly into bed. As he lay there in the dark, he thought about the case. He felt her move. She was facing the other way, but he could hear her laughing. He turned over and asked her what was so funny at this hour of the night. “It was me, my dear. I killed them all.” She turned toward him and said with a wry smile, “I killed them all.”",

As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, the warm spring breeze belied the shattering forces that were about to be unleashed. Eyes fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his forehead, he summoned the strength of a thousand lance-bearers from the Great Age of Antiquity. His arm shot forward, releasing the projectile. Like a dancer, he swung his right arm backward, the ball clenched in his fingers, aching to hurl the object with all the force he could muster. It sailed over the grass like a cannonball, obeying the laws of Newtonian physics with all the predictability and danger that the laws imply. The young lord, as the projectile arced toward him, ran through his mind the torrent of his father’s teachings: “Get in front of it. Keep your eye on the ball.” “Don’t be afraid.” With only a few moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm’s way. His leather glove fanned out like a flower. His knees bent slightly, ready to adjust his stance at the slightest sign of danger. The mighty missile sailed across the spring sky, momentarily blotting out the sun. His eyes remained fixed on the target, like a radar sweeping a giant flying ship. Gravity finally won the day, and the ball swooped down toward the earth, its trajectory snaking toward the small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill, he swung his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic god. The ball thudded into the glove with a thud, a tiny cloud of dust bursting from the impact. A smile of victory spread across the boy’s face. “I got it, Dad!”",

Bullies? No, just the math problems. They told me to write the variable on the left side of the equal sign. They had such silly rules and made me follow them too. Everything they did confined me to a smaller and smaller box. The theme was confinement. Suddenly the door opened. There was an odd brown box at my feet.

In front of me towered a strange, diabolical amalgamation of Mr. Hastings and a ridiculously oversized rubber duck. \" Hello, Mr. Hastings-\" \"QUACK\"- it screamed. I ducked to avoid being beheaded by its bill as it stepped onto the porch. It was rubber, the feel of vulcanized rubber, like the rubber ball my little sister played with. I pressed my head down into the box. Not knowing what to do in this strange situation, I ran straight to the main road, but my shoe caught in the water instead of the asphalt. I splashed into a pond that had flooded the old road. I pulled my head out of the box and got a headful of little rubber ducks. I didn't know how to swim, but I felt happy and blissful as I drowned and sank to the bottom of the pond. I looked to the left, then to the right. The cottage where the Lancasters lived was now a tangle of horsetail and lily pads. Everyone in my usual life was just a big duck, right? What better way to die than in duckland?",

She was so excited. In the bedroom, the police found photographs of the two of them together. She had wanted to pose for the photographs as soon as she had opened the package. She had not needed much persuading to pose provocatively. His family watched the trial in disbelief, unable to believe what they saw. Where had they gone wrong? How could this have happened? Was it true? What had he done? They did not know what to believe, but they told their son that they would always love him, no matter what happened. He felt helpless. He had no way of contacting her. He had often hoped that future generations would not have to bear the stigma of his love, but now he could not think of the future. He was painfully stuck in the present, unable to understand why his actions had led to his imprisonment. He was forbidden to write or telephone her. He knew that if he did manage to get a message to her, it would be intercepted by her parents. They hated him more than anyone else. He was weak and could barely lift his head, but on her birthday he asked a guard if he knew how she was. The guard hesitated. He dreamed of her every night and hoped that one day they would be together again. “She’s fine,” he said. He knew he should not give him any information, but he had seen the way the other prisoners treated the defeated prisoner, and he felt a moment of pity. “Did she get a birthday cake?” “Yes,” the guard said. “Her family sent her a cake. She loves cakes.” “She even managed to blow out all five candles,” the guard said.",

I had never been one of those kooks, but my baby was almost killed!\" I usually tried to chime in, as I got older, that maybe it would have just hurt. I tried to offer some sane explanation, something other than the insane world that this situation implied. Maybe the doctor thought the needle was a little too big for me, and that was what triggered the reaction. Mom always sounded strangely proud of this. \" And that's how we got all the vaccinations banned, and now the children are safe.\" I had never believed those anti-vaccinators, but this was proof! It's a pain to be the literal poster child for the anti-vaccination movement. Mom ignores all the epidemics that have happened since then, and all the children who have died who are not hers.",

What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it touches on are hardly as trivial as suggested. Instead, what usually interests me are the ideas, the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and the additional elements that the authors add to create a fresh feeling of setting. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it's only to be expected, and it's hard to fit much substance into that length; but if I were to judge the top responses on pure literary quality, I would only rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. I want to think about the worlds they create more than I care about the actual events they describe. So that's one desire: to be enchanted, if only a little, by a world. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction for me, but in this format I find it much more important. Surely almost everyone who reads the constant superpower prompts imagines themselves a little as the protagonist? If the mods could manage to focus people's attention a little more on realism and thereby raise the bar a little, it might be interesting to see how the writers adapt. But the current state of affairs is not the only possible one.",

I fainted as the clock, conveniently located behind the baby seal blue, balloon cheeks, read 3:15 p.m. I sat up on the couch. It felt like a long time had passed. My tired eyes looked at the clock.

The phone is missing. I yawn and stretch, squinting at the horizon. I still feel the mark of it around my wrist, so it can't be far. I squelch across the marsh towards the figure. Nothing much to see, a few twisted trees, a low stone wall and a figure in the distance. The crow still watches me, hopping behind me. I try to run through the events of the night. \" Went to the pub with Jim, got a kebab, smoked. Then went to the deli, then... ugh \" I mutter aloud to myself and maybe the crow. As I get closer to the figure, I see that it is standing on the shore of a large lake, lost in the gloom and dampness of the marsh. A small wooden boat with peeling paint bobs in the water. \" Excuse me, mate,\" I say in my least hungover tone. \"Would you mind telling me where I am and how I get home?\" Without turning, the figure replies: \"You're a long way from home here.

Just raising the cup to my lips fills me with a strange sense of pleasure, one I have never known before. I do not even say anything; the man standing by the table—presumably a waiter—fills a cup from a barrel and hands it to me. Then I notice the food. The food is a feast for the eyes, and hopefully for the stomach as well. Starting to drink is orgasmic, and I quickly empty the cup. Then I start to eat.

His father, Samuel, and his mother, Jane, had dined with presidents and kings. They had been the architects of the greatest and most heinous crime in living memory. It was only right that Marc should get the money. They were indispensable members of high society. They could be relied upon to provide full coverage of waking hours, for a price, to the key heads of state of the wealthiest nations on earth. This meant that the key elected officials could work tirelessly around the clock, without rest. And now they were in prison. Marc and Jane Rebus were incredibly rich. Their eldest son was responsible for fifteen siblings. It would not be right for him to be the sole guardian of his blighted siblings, when they themselves had not seen a single day of wakefulness. It was fair that he should inherit, except that he had spent his whole life under sedation. He had the appearance of a fully grown man, but the mental capacity of a newborn baby.",

He helped me when I was down, and I kept him out of trouble. My best friend. But I remember the day it all came crashing down. Just another night. Except this time I wasn't with him. Why? Because I had to stay late at work? No, not that. Because I decided to go out for coffee with Jess. I told you I'd get a ride with her. Three minutes and forty-eight seconds after he hung up, he became just another statistic. \"I'm about to drive past the coffee shop. Are you sure?\" I saw it. I saw him get hit by a drunk driver who ran a red light. I knew it was him. Why didn't they let me ride with him? I met the ambulance at the hospital. He was lying there, strapped to the stretcher, neck brace and all. The doctors pulled me to the side. The heart monitor, a faint, erratic blip. \"I'm sorry.\" I choked back tears. \"I love you,\" I said, choking back the tears. \"I'll always love you.\" He grabbed my hand and pulled it toward his face. He had tears streaming down his face, but he was smiling the biggest smile I'd ever seen. \"You did this to me,\" he said, as my hand brushed his cheek. \"You brought me happiness.\" I didn't have time to answer. I didn't follow the prompt to the letter, but it's what I have.",

It all began innocently enough, with a phone call in the dead of night. An old friend, Jake, had reached out, desperate and scared, seeking refuge from an elusive group of pursuers. Against my better judgment, sympathy compelled me to help him, opening the door to a nightmare I never anticipated. Jake had unwittingly gotten tangled up with a powerful criminal organization, and now they were after him, mercilessly hunting him down. To protect him, I had to uncover their secrets, gathering evidence that could expose their nefarious operations. For days, I delved deeper into the underground world, following a precarious trail of connections and contacts. Yet, every step drew me closer to danger. Suspicion grew like a storm cloud over my head as the tendrils of the syndicate's influence snaked around my life. My home was ransacked, threats were whispered through anonymous calls, and shadowy figures lingered at every turn. Paranoia seeped into my bones, but I pressed on, driven by a stubborn determination to expose the truth. Finally, the breakthrough came when I discovered a hidden meeting place, a dilapidated warehouse concealed in the heart of the city. Armed with my findings, I naively believed that justice would prevail. Little did I know, they were always one step ahead. As I stepped into the warehouse, I realized it was a trap. Overwhelmed by a swarm of ruthless enforcers, I fought with all my might, but their strength was insurmountable. I was outnumbered, outmatched, and outgunned. In the chaos, a gunshot rang out, piercing the air, and pain seared through my body. The world blurred, spinning out of control as gravity took hold. Memories flashed before my eyes, unfulfilled dreams and cherished moments intertwined with regret. Regret for the choices I made, the risks I took, and the trust I misplaced.",

Little did anyone know that its impact would extend far beyond entertainment. Suddenly, hordes of aliens from distant galaxies descended upon Earth, not with hostile intentions or a desire to forge alliances, but rather to beg for mercy. They pleaded for humanity to cease sending their scouts, known as \"Players,\" who had unknowingly been wreaking havoc upon these unsuspecting civilizations. The aliens were defenseless against the advanced weaponry and technology possessed by the Players, who regarded their actions as mere gameplay. Distraught, the aliens communicated their distress through a global broadcast, desperate to make humanity understand the devastation they had caused. The once-thriving civilizations were reduced to rubble, their cultures erased. Witnessing the intergalactic plea, humanity was struck by a collective wave of guilt, realizing the unimaginable consequences of their actions. Governments and scientists scrambled to find a solution, calling for a worldwide ceasefire in the virtual universe. No Man's Sky was updated overnight, restricting the activities of Players within specific zones to prevent further destruction. Diplomatic channels were opened, as efforts to rebuild trust between Earth and the aggrieved alien civilizations were set in motion. Cautiously, humanity started to make amends, pledging resources and expertise to aid in the restoration process. The fifth year after the release of No Man's Sky marked a turning point, where mankind learned a profound lesson about the impact of their actions, and vowed to be more considerate custodians of both virtual and real worlds alike.",

Those were the days of glory and excitement, filled with endless quests and epic victories. However, fate had an unexpected turn in store for me. I found myself back in the mundane world, a single dad living in a modest apartment in New York City. Gone were the enchanted weapons and spellbooks; now, my days were consumed by diaper changes and supermarket runs. My children, Sophie and Max, were my new companions on this journey. Instead of facing dragons and wizards, I faced the challenges of parenthood with unwavering determination. The once magical artifacts were replaced by baby bottles and toys strewn across the living room floor. The thrill of defeating evil overlords paled in comparison to the joy of hearing my children's laughter. Though I missed the adrenaline of battle, I discovered the true meaning of love and sacrifice in caring for my little ones. My old adventuring companions may have called me a quitter, but nothing compared to the satisfaction of seeing my children grow and thrive. So, while my adventures now revolved around bedtime stories and scraped knees, I wouldn't trade this new chapter of my life for anything in the world.",

It may sound unusual, but we were authorized to use deadly force if necessary. The reason behind such extreme precautions was to maintain the authenticity of our members and create a safe space for farmers looking for companionship.One day, I received an application from a man named Jack Richardson. His profile seemed suspicious, lacking any convincing agricultural background. Determined to uncover the truth, I decided to pay him a visit. Armed with a notepad and a concealed weapon, I arrived at his address.As I peered through the window, I noticed something peculiar – a room filled with surfboards and beach-themed decorations. This certainly didn't align with the rugged, rustic lifestyle of a farmer. It was time to confront him. I knocked on the door, my heart pounding in anticipation.When Jack opened the door, a perfectly tanned and fit physique greeted me. His surfer-like appearance made me doubt his claims even more. I proceeded to question him rigorously about his farming expertise, plants, livestock, and agricultural techniques. Jack's vague and hesitant responses further confirmed my suspicions.Unable to contain my frustration, I decided to take a bold step. I showed him my badge and informed him of the gravity of his deception. As panic flickered in his eyes, he pleaded for mercy, revealing that his application was a joke, a prank pulled by his mischievous friends. He confessed to having no connection with farming whatsoever.In that moment, my initial anger dissolved, replaced by a deep sense of relief. I realized that using deadly force was far too extreme in this situation. I contemplated the consequences of my previous actions, questioning the extremes I was authorized to employ.",

The extraterrestrial overlords seemed uninterested in altering our daily routines, allowing us to maintain our jobs, relationships, and hobbies uninterrupted. Initially, there was fear and uncertainty, but as days turned into weeks, people began to realize that the aliens were not here to harm us. They watched from afar, observing our way of life with a curiosity that mirrored our own. As time went on, a sense of coexistence developed, and interactions between humans and aliens became more commonplace. We learned that their technology was far superior to ours, and they willingly shared their knowledge to help us overcome pressing global issues such as climate change and disease control. Gradually, humanity began to appreciate the aliens' presence, realizing that they unintentionally brought about positive change. Scientific advancements flourished as collaborations between our species led to new discoveries. With a newfound perspective, we embraced the aliens' existence, viewing them not as conquerors but as benevolent guides pushing us towards progress. Ultimately, the arrival of extraterrestrial beings proved that sometimes it takes an external force to remind us of our collective potential and inspire us to strive for a better future.",

Upon closer inspection, I realized that these were the journals of war survivors from a forgotten era.The first journal belonged to a soldier who fought valiantly in the trenches of World War I. His words painted a vivid picture of the horrors he witnessed, the deafening sounds of gunfire and the acrid stench of death. He wrote of comradery and the unwavering spirit that kept him going, despite the relentless onslaught.The second journal revealed the heartbreaking accounts of a nurse during the Vietnam War. She described the endless stream of wounded soldiers arriving at the field hospital, their bodies broken and spirits shattered. Her words captured both the despair and resilience of those who tended to the wounded, offering solace amidst chaos.Another journal chronicled the experiences of a child living through the ravages of World War II. Her innocent words were filled with confusion and fear, as she witnessed the destruction of her home and the loss of loved ones. Yet, amidst the darkness, her spirit remained unbroken, finding solace in small acts of kindness and hope for a brighter future.As I delved deeper into the journals, I encountered stories from soldiers who fought in various conflicts throughout history. Each entry was a testament to the human spirit, showcasing the unyielding determination to survive against all odds. They wrote of love and loss, of bravery and sacrifice, and of the scars that would forever etch their souls.The journals transported me to different times and places, immersing me in the harsh realities and profound depths of human experience during war.

People from every corner of the globe contemplated their choices, aware of a unique catch attached to this incredible gift. The more individuals who selected a specific power, the weaker it would become for everyone who possessed it. The news spread like wildfire, sparking discussions, debates, and countless possibilities. A young boy named Ethan, captivated by this revelation, decided to wait patiently before making his decision. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as the world eagerly embraced their chosen superpowers. Flight soared in popularity, but its potency dwindled amidst the crowded skies. Invisibility became a popular choice for those seeking anonymity, yet it lost its effectiveness due to the sheer number of invisible individuals lurking about. Telekinesis, once a formidable force, grew feeble as multitudes learned to bend the world to their will. As the months passed, Ethan observed the shifting dynamics, realizing that the most popular powers now held little sway. In a stroke of insight, he selected a power that seemed insignificant to the masses: the ability to control plants. The world hardly blinked as Ethan acquired his power, believing him to have made a futile choice. However, Ethan's decision unleashed a profound ripple. The plants responded to his touch, flourishing with unprecedented vitality. Word of this extraordinary power quickly spread, and soon, others recognized its potential. People began selecting the power to manipulate nature, hoping to amplify their abilities through cooperation. The lush foliage grew denser and more formidable, cities transformed into vibrant ecosystems, and humanity found solace in a symbiotic relationship with the natural world.

Those who survived were burdened with a daunting task: to pay a tithe of one-tenth of the world's population every decade or face the grim fate of being enslaved by the extraterrestrial conquerors. The year is now 2060, and I find myself among the chosen few who must fulfill this unsettling obligation. However, within me burns a fiery defiance that refuses to succumb silently to this supposed fate. As the deadline for the tithe looms ever closer, I gather a group of like-minded individuals who share my unwavering spirit of resistance.

Through covert operations, we gather evidence of their exploitation and oppression, revealing their deceitful narrative to the remaining survivors. Word spreads like wildfire, igniting the dormant flames of rebellion within the hearts of our fellow humans. The oppressed masses rise against their captors, refusing to submit any longer. The tide begins to turn, and our numbers swell as more people join our cause, driven by a newfound hope that surges through the Earth's veins.The alien invaders, caught off guard by our unprecedented unity, scramble to maintain control over a now defiant population. Their once-assured dominance begins to crumble amidst the chaos they never anticipated. In the midst of the uprising, we strike at the heart of their operation, targeting their control center with precision and determination.",

The letter summoned him for jury duty, something he had never imagined happening. Intrigued, he decided to embrace the opportunity to witness the justice system from a different perspective. As he sat in the jury box during a high-profile trial, he observed the defendant, Mark, a meek and innocent-looking man. Soon, John's intuition told him that something was amiss. The evidence presented against Mark seemed circumstantial, and doubts began to creep into John's mind. He couldn't ignore the nagging feeling that Mark was falsely accused of his own heinous crimes. Unbeknownst to everyone else, John had an uncanny ability to understand the psychology of killers. He had spent years studying his own actions, and now he used that knowledge to carefully analyze the behavior of the alleged victims. To his horror, he realized that the real murderer was still at large. This revelation shook John to his core. He had killed countless innocent people, thinking he was cleansing the world. But now, he had a chance to atone for his sins in a way he never anticipated. John started discreetly investigating the crimes, digging into the victim profiles and the evidence presented in court. As he delved deeper, he discovered chilling similarities between his own acts and the newly found details. He also uncovered crucial clues that pointed to another person's involvement. With mounting evidence, John approached Mark's defense attorney, revealing his true identity and offering his assistance. The attorney, initially skeptical but desperate to save his client, agreed to collaborate with the reformed serial killer. Together, they presented their findings to the court, casting a shadow of doubt over the prosecution's case. The trial took an unexpected turn as the jury listened carefully to John's account. As he testified, the courtroom was filled with a sense of eerie silence.",

She quickly stripped down to her swimsuit and plunged into the cool embrace of the water.To her surprise, she wasn't alone. A mischievous little squirrel named Nutkin was perched on a nearby branch, watching her with curious eyes. Emily tried to befriend the cute creature by offering it a handful of acorns from her backpack.

It was a beautiful water nymph who glowed with ethereal light. She introduced herself as Aquaria, the guardian of the enchanted forest. Aquaria explained that she had been watching over the forest for centuries, safeguarding its magic.Emily, Nutkin, and Aquaria spent hours conversing about the wonders of the forest. They shared tales of mythical creatures and hidden treasures. Aquaria revealed that she possessed the power to grant one wish. Overwhelmed with excitement, Emily wished for everlasting happiness for everyone in the town of Willowbrook.Suddenly, the tranquil forest turned dark and foreboding.

Over the next centuries, advances started coming more rapidly as ideas emerged that pushed the boundaries of science. As the deities next convened, God eagerly awaited showing off what Earth had achieved. He was pleased to announce that basic space stations now orbited the planet, acting as gateways for further missions. Odin and Zeus seemed impressed by the progress, though not yet rivals to their own empire-building. Through continued covert guidance, God helped discoveries build upon each other. Word reached the upper atmospheres that Earth scientists theorized ways to manipulate fundamental forces. Now there were ambitious plans to establish self-sustaining colonies on Mars and beyond.

Peanut butter, canned soup, pasta - everything I saw had a resale value far more than usual. It was as if others suddenly saw value in these everyday groceries. I rushed through the rest of my shopping, curious to see if this was just a fluke of this particular store. But the trend continued at the next shop - even produce had inflated values.  By the afternoon, resale prices had only continued climbing. It was hard to find any item under $10. Panic started to set in as shoppers emptied shelves. I turned on the news hoping for an explanation but reports were as baffled as everyone else. The next day, resale values reached unprecedented highs. A loaf of bread was worth $50!

The inflated resale values showed no sign of slowing. Generators and non-perishable food became the new currency. I began to worry how much longer society could last like this. Then, just as suddenly as it started, the resale prices began falling again. Within a couple days, values returned to normal levels.

Scholarship opportunities had expired, money for tuition was slipping away.Laying in her bed staring at her phone, Sara scrolled through past reminders and alerts, each a representation of another chance that she let pass her by. How could she have been so careless? Her future was supposed to be set by now.Instead she was adrift, untethered from the goals and timeline that had guided her for so long. What would she do if no schools accepted her now? How could she afford an education without aid? Sadness and panic rose in her chest as the full magnitude of her failure truly began to sink in. All because she missed a few deadlines along the way, her path forward had vanished before her eyes. The road ahead stretched on, darker than ever before. For the first time, Sara didn't know where her life was headed next. Somewhere amongst the pile of overlooked tasks, she had lost sight of her destiny.",

For centuries, magic was wielded through the four classical elements of earth, air, fire and water drawn from the natural world. But one young mage named Aria claimed to have discovered a new form of magic beyond the old ways. She began her demonstration and called upon strands of pure mystic energy, manipulating the invisible forces through intricate gestures and chants. Everyone watched in awe as colors shifted in the air and floating orbs of light appeared. Aria showed she had mastery over this unknown system, twisting the energies into amazing shapes and patterns. But some of the older magicians were skeptical, insisting one could only draw power from the stable sources that had always existed. On the final day of trials, Aria sought to change their minds by attempting her most challenging feat yet. She would try to summon a magical construct and breathe life into it through her new form of magic alone. After lengthy preparations, a shimmering creature took form, bringing astonished gasps from all who witnessed its impossible existence.Yet just when it seemed Aria had triumphed, something went wrong with her spell. The magical forces spiraled out of her control and the glowing being twisted into a malevolent form. It turned on the audience with a roar as an unnatural storm erupted in the hall. Aria struggled desperately to end her spell but it was too late to stop the chaos. The Magisterium was plunged into crisis as they faced this new type of magic, both its promise and its peril. For discovering its secrets, Aria would bear the burden of responsibility for where this new path might lead.",

As the moon's glow strengthened, I felt the familiar twist in my bones. My limbs stretched and reformed as fur receded into skin. When the change ended, I stood naked on two human feet. The cool night air raised goosebumps on my flesh. I stepped lightly through the forest, searching for any trace of civilization. Broken branches and boot prints in the mud offered a direction to follow. Between the trees, a flickering light came into view. I crept closer and realized it was a campfire outside a small cabin. An old man sat beside it, smoking a pipe. Staying downwind, I dared move no closer. As the moon set, the pull came again to change once more. My organs twisted within me as fur and claw regrew. On four paws once more, I turned and vanished into the protecting shadows of the woods. The next month, perhaps, I would try contacting the man if he was still there. For now, my secret remained only with the moon.",

Another requested stories of the first contact between survivors. Most had given up posting, focusing their efforts on finding resources and community. I scrolled through the few new responses, hoping to gain insight or hope. One user described scavenging cans of beans and formulating a fire to heat them. Another told of hearing radio calls and leading a group to the broadcast location. As infrastructure failed, prompts turned to survival rather than imaginings. People shared strategies for finding clean water or repurposing common items as tools. My notifications were silent, no longer buzzing with likes or comments on my writings. I used to while away evenings crafting tales, but now real life offered enough thrills. The apocalypse had arrived and reality surpassed any dystopian vision. Where once I posted prompts, now I searched for others to face tomorrow with. This website served no purpose beyond memories of before, so with a sigh I closed the page, hoping those I knew found safety in the new world emerging from the ashes of the old.

As she reached out to grab the fuzzball, it swiped at her hand with its tiny claw. \"Ouch!\" Sara cried as she felt the tiny prick. Within moments, Sara felt strange, as if her bones were shrinking. Her clothes fell loose around her as she dropped to all fours, shrinking smaller and smaller. She tried to call out for help but instead a meow escaped her lips.Trapped in her new kitten body, Sara pawed at the fence, unable to climb over in her new tiny form. She saw the neighbor boy and tried to get his attention with pitiful meows. Luckily he spotted the unusual kitten and opened the gate. \"Aww, what's wrong little guy?\" he cooed, not realizing Sara's secret. She crawled up his leg, kneading her paws into his jeans. \"Hey, that tickles!\" he laughed.That evening Sara's parents began to worry when she didn't come home for dinner. They called the neighbors and learned about the stray kitten. When they saw the kitten clinging to their son, they recognized the color of Sara's favorite sweater mingled in its fluffy coat. They coaxed the kitten away and were shocked when it meowed \"Mom!\" in a tiny voice. After the neighbor boy told them what happened, they rushed Sara to the vet, hoping there was a cure. The vet examined Sara closely, finding no signs of injury from the kitten bite besides two small holes in her tiny paw pad. He'd never seen anything like this before and had no answers for how to change her back. For now, Sara was stuck as a kitten. At least at home she could play with her old kitty toys and drink milk from an eyedropper. Her parents promised to help figure out how to return her to normal, but for now she was the family pet.",

Outside my window, the moon provided the only light, its pale glow barely cutting through the inky blackness. I turned onto my side hoping to find a more comfortable position but my mind was restless. From somewhere in the distance, a lonely owl hooted into the night. After what seemed like hours, sleep still wouldn't come. Getting frustrated, I threw back the covers and swung my legs over the side of the bed.The cold wooden floor felt icy against my bare feet. As I walked to the window, the boards creaked under my weight. Pulling back the curtain, I peered out into the night. At first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary in the moonlit landscape. But then I noticed movement by the large oak tree at the end of the drive.Two faint glowing orbs appeared and stared back at me unblinking. My heart leapt into my throat as an overwhelming sense of fear washed over me. I stumbled backward away from the window, tripping over my feet in my haste. Crashing to the floor, I let out an involuntary yelp of surprise. Had whatever was outside heard me? I lay shaking, too afraid to move — or even breathe — as I waited for the long night to end.",

Once a devout servant of God, he now found himself questioning everything. As he stared out the window, his eyes fell upon a young boy in the fields below. An unholy thought entered his mind, one he tried to push away but couldn't. That night, he crept into the orphanage and found the boy sleeping.The boy woke with a start to find the priest looming over him. Terrified, he tried to cry out but a hand covered his mouth. \"Be quiet and it won't hurt,\" the priest whispered as he untied his robe. A muffled scream was stifled.The next morning, the boy told the sisters what happened but they didn't believe his story. No one would listen to him. After that night, it continued whenever the priest visited. Each time, the guilt ate away at his soul. One evening, consumed with self-loathing, he took a knife and wandered into the confessional. When the priest arrived, he stabbed him over and over until he stopped moving. Breathing heavily, he sat in the darkness.When his crimes were discovered, he was arrested and taken to a miserable cell to await trial. All who knew him were shocked, unable to believe the kindly priest could commit such evil acts. Alone with his torment, he begged for death's release.On the day of his execution, he was dragged from his cell into the light of dawn. As the noose was placed around his neck, he saw the boy in the crowd, eyes filled with hatred. Their eyes met one last time before the floor dropped. \"You will burn in hell for your sins,\" the boy said coldly.",

One day, I stumbled upon an ancient underground temple. Intrigued, I descended the moss-covered stone steps. Torches flickered as I explored cavernous rooms with towering pillars. Strange carvings and hieroglyphs covered every surface, but I couldn't decipher their meaning. As I peered into one shadowy alcove, I stepped on a hidden pressure plate. A rumbling shook the temple as long-dormant traps sprang to life. Dart launchers fired and spears shot from the walls. I dashed through a gauntlet of blades and arrows, barely dodging each deadly obstacle. Deep within the temple, I discovered a room full of treasure. Gold coins and jewels glittered in the torchlight. But as I grabbed a handful, the floor gave way. I plunged into an inky black pool. Somehow I surfaced in a sunlit oasis, miles from the forest. Exhausted but alive, I stumbled home and told of my adventure, but no one believed my fantastic tale. To this day, I'm still not sure what really happened in that underground temple so long ago.",

They seemed dazed and moved slowly, grunting incomprehensibly. The CDC was called in to investigate and soon confirmed their fears - this was the first outbreak of zombies in America. Within hours, several more people had turned.The military was deployed, but coordinating a response proved difficult due to the zombies' random movements. They shambled down streets, occasionally grabbing at anyone they happened to encounter.However, it quickly became apparent that the zombies possessed no real coordination or higher brain function. They wandered aimlessly and could barely manage to eat the occasional victim.After only a day, the zombies had mostly just laid down in the middle of roads or fields, losing interest once their immediate hunger was satisfied. With no real packs or communicated threats, they posed little danger.The remaining living inhabitants of the town were easily able to avoid the shambling corpses or fight them off one by one when needed. By nightfall, most zombies had simply collapsed motionless. An autopsy of one zombie revealed it had died of starvation, as it was unable to effectively hunt or forage on its own. Within 25 hours, the last zombie had expired, marking the end of the outbreak.The CDC declared the zombie threat neutralized. It seemed that without human coordination or intelligence, individual zombies were effectively harmless on their own.The town began to rebuild, and the federal government launched studies to better understand how to contain future outbreaks, which they hoped would also prove as ineffectual as the first.Many were left to wonder what might have happened if the zombies had displayed even basic survival skills or pack instincts, but for now, the residents could rest easy knowing the threat had passed.",

But it turned out that aliens were not lurking among distant solar systems, but rather in our own backyard, hidden from view in the deepest reaches of Earth's oceans. On a routine dive to survey undersea geothermal vents, researchers were stunned to encounter strange structures crafted from chemicals and rocks, with complex textures that seemed deliberately designed. Video footage and samples were analyzed back on land, and it became clear these were no natural formations, but artifacts of an unknown intelligence living far below the waves.Attempts were made to communicate via video feeds and carefully positioned signals, with increasing success over months of slow interaction. It emerged these beings, dubbed the \"abyssopians,\" lacked voices but had developed an electrical communication system, sending and receiving waves through their surroundings. While bizarre anatomically, with no eyes or limbs, the abyssopians exhibited keen problem solving abilities and an advanced ecological understanding of the vent ecosystems they called home. They harvested chemicals from the vents for fuels and building materials, and cultivated thermal-loving microbes on \"farms\" to sustain their energy needs.World governments came together to fund a joint deep-sea research station, with advanced submersibles and Internet 2-style connectivity, to foster deeper understanding between humans and the unexpected neighbor we had discovered at the bottom of the sea. While barriers of biology and environment initially made true interaction challenging, open exchange of knowledge was transforming views of what life might emerge in isolation on our shared planet.",

As a muggle-born, magic was still so new to me. On the first day, Professor Kirby taught us the basics of painting wizarding portraits. My hands shook as I brushed color onto the canvas. When it came time for the incantation, I nervously pointed my wand at the wet paints. \"Amasius!\" I said with little confidence. To my horror, the colors swirling began to take a sinister shape. Two glowing eyes emerged from the dark blob followed by a misshapen face. A gutteral groan escaped from the thing I had created. The students scrambled away in fear as the creature grew in size. Professor Kirby tried to subdue it with spells but nothing worked on my monster. It lashed out with spindly arms, destroying paintings and furniture in the room. Alarms began to sound as more teachers rushed in to help. After causing chaos for several minutes, Professor Dumbledore was able to banish my botched painting with a powerful charm. I was mortified and couldn't look anyone in the eye for a week after that disastrous first lesson.",

She held her mother's hand tightly as they walked into the bright classroom. Before she knew it, recess had arrived and all the children ran outside to play. Mary saw a group of girls jumping rope and wanted to join, but they told her she wasn't welcome. Feeling lonely, she wandered over to the swings by herself. As she sat kicking her legs back and forth, a boy named Jake came over and offered to push her. She smiled, glad to have a friend. But after a few pushes, he gave her an extra hard push that sent her tumbling to the ground. She cried out in pain as her arm bent at an odd angle. The teacher came rushing over and saw the injury was very serious. An ambulance was called to take Mary to the hospital. After x-rays, the doctor said her arm was broken and she would need a cast. Mary cried into her mother's shoulder, scared and unsure of what would happen next. More bad news followed - because of her injury, she would have to miss the rest of the school year. All of her hopes and dreams of making friends and having fun were crushed in an instant on that fateful first day of school.",

The sword glimmered with an otherworldly light, as if it held the power of the gods within its blade. But as they looked amongst themselves, they realized that only their cleric, Sarah, had any experience wielding a sword.Sarah had taken a summer course in fencing, not out of passion, but to boost her GPA. She had never been particularly skilled, but she had always been determined. She stepped forward, her hands shaking slightly as she grasped the hilt of the sword.As she raised the sword, the party watched in anticipation. Sarah took a deep breath, focusing on the Demon King in the distance. She charged forward, the sword slicing through the air with a strange, unfamiliar weight.The Demon King snickered, his massive blade flashing in the sunlight. He swung his sword in a slow, deliberate arc, and Sarah parried clumsily, her movements awkward and stilted. The party watched in horror as the Demon King's blade bit deep into Sarah's sword, nearly cutting it in half.But Sarah refused to back down. She gritted her teeth and swung again, her movements a little more assured this time. The Demon King chuckled, a hint of respect in his eyes, and the two of them continued to dance around each other, their swords clashing in a flurry of blows.The party watched in awe, their hearts pounding in their chests. They knew that Sarah was no match for the Demon King, but they also knew that she was their only hope. They cheered her on, their voices ringing out across the battlefield.Sarah fought with all her might, her movements growing more confident with each passing moment. The Demon King grunted in surprise, his eyes narrowing as Sarah landed a lucky blow. But he quickly regained his footing, his sword flashing forward once again.And so the battle continued, Sarah and the Demon King locked in a deadly dance.",

I took off my headphones, thinking maybe the music had stopped, but the silence was deafening. I looked around, confused, and saw that my roommate was still watching TV, but there was no sound coming from it.I tried to shake off the feeling and went about my day, but it quickly became apparent that something was wrong. The streets were eerily quiet, and people were walking around with confused looks on their faces.As the days went by, scientists confirmed our worst fears: sound had ceased to exist. It wasn't just music or speech, but all sound, including the hum of the refrigerator and the chirping of birds. The world was suddenly, and inexplicably, silent.In the immediate aftermath, people were in a state of shock. They wandered the streets, unsure of what to do or how to communicate. Some tried to use sign language, but it was slow and awkward. Others wrote notes to each other, but it was cumbersome and inefficient.As the days turned into weeks, society began to adapt. Businesses started using flashing lights or vibrations to communicate with customers. People learned to read lips and use hand gestures to communicate with each other.But the silence was oppressive. It weighed heavy on our minds and made us feel isolated and alone. The lack of sound made it difficult to sleep, and many people suffered from insomnia and anxiety.10 years have passed since the silence descended, and society has transformed in ways we never could have imagined. The world is a different place now, one where sound is just a distant memory.People have learned to live in this new reality, but it's not without its challenges. There are no more concerts, no more laughter, no more singing. The beauty of music is now just a memory, a distant recollection of a time when sound filled our lives.",

She snuck into the Generator room under the cover of night, and began to hack into the system.As she worked, the Generator began to malfunction, causing a massive blackout across the colony. Maya knew this would create a window of opportunity for her to sneak past the guards and find the hidden ship.With a racing heart, Maya made her way through the dark and deserted corridors of the colony, avoiding patrolling guards and dodging security drones.",

What's the main character's name?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"Her name is Sarah.\"\"Great,\" I said. \"Now, what's Sarah's goal in the story?\"The writer hesitated again, but eventually said, \"She wants to find her missing sister.\"I nodded. \"That's a good start. What obstacles will Sarah face in her journey?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"She'll have to navigate through a dangerous forest and confront a group of bandits.\"I smiled. \"Excellent. Now, let's talk about the tone of your story. Is it a lighthearted adventure or a darker, more serious tale?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"I want it to be a lighthearted adventure, but with some dark moments to add depth.\"I nodded. \"That sounds like a great balance. Now, let's work on developing your characters. Who is Sarah's love interest?\"The writer smiled. \"His name is Alex. He's a charming thief who joins Sarah on her quest.\"I chuckled. \"I like the sound of that. How do Sarah and Alex meet?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"They meet in a tavern.",

It was a revolutionary invention that had brought people from all over the world closer together. I, like many others, had fallen in love with a foreign woman named Sophia. She was from a small country in Europe, and her native language was Greek. I had always been fascinated by her culture and language, and I decided to learn Greek as an act of love towards her.At first, it was difficult. Greek was a language that was vastly different from my native English, and it took me a while to get the hang of it. But with the help of my ear device, I was able to practice and improve quickly. Sophia was impressed with my dedication and enthusiasm, and we started spending more and more time together.As we spent more time together, I started to realize that I wasn't falling in love with Sophia's personality, but with the ear device's get-along editing feature. It was a feature that allowed me to communicate with Sophia in her own language, without any awkwardness or misunderstandings. It was like having a personal translator, always there to help me express my thoughts and feelings.I started to depend on the ear device more and more, and I found myself using it all the time. I would even use it when Sophia and I were alone, just to make sure that I was saying the right things. It became a crutch for me, and I didn't know how to communicate without it.Sophia started to notice my reliance on the ear device, and she began to feel neglected. She would try to talk to me in English, but I would always respond in Greek, using the ear device to translate. She started to feel like I was more interested in the technology than in her.One day, Sophia confronted me about my use of the ear device. She told me that she felt like I was hiding behind it, and that I wasn't making an effort to truly connect with her.",

The trees towered above me, casting deep shadows that seemed to move and twist in the flickering moonlight. Suddenly, I came across a clearing, and my heart skipped a beat as I saw two swords stabbed into a dais in the center.The dais was old and worn, its once-grand design now covered in moss and lichen. The swords themselves looked ancient, their blades gleaming in the moonlight. I approached cautiously, my hand on the hilt of my own sword, ready to defend myself if needed.As I drew closer, I saw that the dais had a small inscription etched into its surface. It read, \"The left sword turns you into a villain that saves the world. The right sword turns you into a hero that damns the world.\" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the weight of the choice before me.I looked at the swords, trying to see any difference between them. They looked identical to me, their blades sharp and deadly. How could I know which one to choose? I thought about the state of the world, about the wars and famines, the suffering and injustice.I knew that I had always wanted to be a hero, to make a difference and leave the world a better place than I found it. But what if the only way to do that was to become a villain? Could I bring myself to do such a thing?I thought about the people I had known, the friends I had lost, the loved ones I had seen suffer. Could I truly say that I was willing to do whatever it took to save the world, even if it meant becoming a villain?I looked at the swords again, and my heart was heavy with indecision. I knew that I had to make a choice, but I didn't know which one to make. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to clear my mind and listen to my heart.Finally, I made my decision. I reached out and grasped the hilt of the left sword, feeling a surge of power run through me.",

Ava listened intently, taking note of the similarities and differences between Islam and Christianity.Ava then shared the fundamental beliefs of Christianity, focusing on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Max was intrigued by the concept of salvation through faith in Jesus, and asked Ava to elaborate.As they delved deeper into their discussion, they started to compare the leaders of their respective religions. Max spoke about the prophet Muhammad, who received divine revelations from Allah and recorded them in the Quran. Ava shared stories about Jesus, who preached love, forgiveness, and salvation.Max and Ava also talked about the role of women in their religions. Max explained that Islam values gender equality and empowers women to participate in society. Ava discussed how Christianity has a rich history of female leaders, such as saints and martyrs.As their conversation progressed, they addressed misconceptions about their religions. Max clarified that Islam is a religion of peace, dispelling stereotypes of violence and oppression. Ava emphasized that Christianity is not just a Western religion, but a global faith with diverse followers.The two also touched on the topic of interfaith dialogue. Max expressed his appreciation for Ava's willingness to engage in respectful conversation, and Ava praised Max's open-mindedness.After hours of thoughtful discussion, Max and Ava concluded that, despite their differences, they shared a common goal: to live according to their beliefs and spread love and compassion.",

I have lived a long, full life. It is time for me to rest.\"Death stepped forward, his scythe glinting in the fading sunlight. God closed his eyes, ready to meet his fate.But as Death raised his scythe to strike, a strange feeling overcame him. It was a feeling he had never experienced before - doubt.He looked at God, and for a moment, he saw the universe through His eyes. He saw the beauty and wonder of creation, the love and compassion that had gone into every detail.Death hesitated, his scythe wavering in mid-air. \"I cannot do it,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.God opened his eyes, surprise etched across his face. \"What do you mean?\"Death took a step back, his scythe slipping from his grasp. \"I cannot take your life, God. You have created too much, loved too much. Your life is too precious.\"God's face softened, a small smile playing on his lips. \"You have learned compassion, Death. I am proud of you.\"Death looked down, a strange sensation in his chest. It was a feeling he had never experienced before - joy.\"Thank you, God,\" he said, his voice filled with gratitude. \"Thank you for showing me the value of life.",

It was a tube of lotion, plain and unassuming. But as soon as it was created, a god was born to reign over its domain.I was that god, and I was tasked with watching over this mundane object. At first, it was easy. The tube of lotion sat on a shelf in a drugstore, untouched and unnoticed. But as time passed, people began to take notice. They picked it up, examined it, and eventually, they started to use it.At first, it was just a few people here and there. But soon, more and more people were using the lotion. They loved how it made their skin feel, how it soothed their dryness and irritation. They began to rely on it, to need it.And as they did, my power grew. I was no longer just a simple god of a tube of lotion. I was a god of skin, of moisture, of comfort. People came to me, praying for relief from their dry, itchy skin.

I made deals with them, offering them my blessing in exchange for their loyalty. And slowly but surely, my empire grew.But as my empire grew, so did my reputation. People began to fear me, to tremble at the mention of my name. They saw me as a god of darkness, of greed, of manipulation. They saw me as a god who would stop at nothing to get what I wanted.And perhaps they were right. For I would do anything to ensure the success of my domain. I would crush any competitors, any threats to my reign. I would use every trick in the book to maintain my power.But I didn't care. I was a god, after all.

Whiskers was exhausted but exhilarated.\"Thank you for today, Robby,\" Whiskers said. \"I never knew how boring my life was until now.\"Robby was pleased to have been able to show Whiskers the joys of adventure. \"Anytime, Whiskers.

The scenery is familiar, yet somehow, it feels like a distant memory that I can't quite place. I continue on, my feet carrying me deeper into the unknown, when suddenly, a structure comes into view. It's a ruin, long-dead and decrepit, but there's something about it that feels eerily familiar.As I draw closer, I realize with a start that this is a place I recognized, but until now, I was absolutely certain couldn't have possibly existed. It's a castle, one that I've seen countless times in my dreams, but never thought was real. The walls are crumbling, the once grand towers now reduced to rubble. Yet, despite its state of disrepair, there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.I walk closer, my heart pounding in my chest, and run my hand over the rough stone. It's cool to the touch, and I can feel the history seeping out of it. I imagine the battles that were fought here, the feasts that were held, the lives that were lived within these walls.As I explore further, I come across a courtyard, the flagstones cracked and overgrown with weeds. In the center, a fountain sits, dry and lifeless, its waters long since gone. I can almost hear the sound of laughter and the splashing of water, though, and I feel a pang of sadness that this place has been left to decay.Despite the ruin, there's still a sense of grandeur here, a feeling of majesty that can't be denied. I climb the crumbling stairs to the top of a tower, and look out over the countryside. The view is breathtaking, rolling hills stretching out as far as the eye can see.As I stand here, the wind whipping my hair and the sun beating down on my skin, I can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. This place, this impossible place, is a reminder that there's still so much in the world that we don't understand, so much that we can't explain.",

The team waited anxiously for something to happen. Suddenly, a message appeared on the machine's screen.\" Warning, do not use this machine. It will lead to catastrophic consequences.\"The team was taken aback. Where had this message come from? They quickly realized that it had come from the future, through the very machine they had just turned on.\"This is impossible,\" exclaimed Dr. Patel. \"How can we be receiving messages from the future?\"More messages began to flood in, each one urging the team not to use the machine. They were confused and frightened, unsure of what to do.\"We have to listen to these messages,\" said Dr. Thompson. \"We can't risk the fate of the world.\"But Dr. Patel was not so easily deterred. He was determined to prove that the machine worked, and that they could communicate with the future.\"We can't just ignore this,\" he said. \"We have to explore this new frontier.\"The team was divided, some agreeing with Dr. Thompson, while others sided with Dr. Patel. The debate raged on, with no clear resolution in sight.As the messages continued to come in, they became increasingly dire. The team knew they had to make a decision, and fast.Finally, after hours of argument, they decided to shut down the machine. They realized that the risks outweighed the benefits, and that they had a responsibility to protect the future.But it was too late. The damage had already been done. The machine had been turned on, and the consequences would be felt for years to come.In the end, the team was left with more questions than answers.",

Slowly but surely, we began to understand each other.She told us that they had been watching our planet for centuries, studying us and learning about our culture. They had come in peace.We were stunned. Our beliefs about the universe had been turned upside down.

It seemed that humans had a unique ability to empathize with other living beings, but at the same time, they also had a strange desire to cause pain and suffering to those same beings.The scientists were baffled. They couldn't understand why humans would go out of their way to hurt others, even when there was nothing to gain from it. They conducted more experiments, tested different theories, but the answer remained elusive.As the years went by, humanity continued to hurt each other. They built weapons of mass destruction, started wars over petty differences, and even exploited and enslaved other species.

And so, even in the midst of this war, I found a sense of peace, a sense of purpose.This war of mine would one day come to an end, but the scars it had left would never fully heal. I would carry the memories of it with me for the rest of my life, a reminder of the fragility of humanity and the importance of cherishing every moment of peace.",

I didn't think much of it as a child, but as I grew older, I began to notice that the necklace would occasionally grow warm. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but as time passed, I realized that the necklace was actually trying to tell me something.One day, when I was in my early twenties, the necklace started to glow warmly, and I knew that my soul mate was near. I looked around, but I didn't see anyone who caught my eye. I decided to go out and explore the city, hoping to find the person who was meant to be mine.As I walked through the bustling streets, the necklace grew warmer and warmer. I felt a sense of excitement and nervousness building up inside me. Finally, I saw a man across the street, and the necklace glowed brightly. I knew that he was the one.We introduced ourselves, and it was like we had known each other forever. We spent hours talking and laughing together, and I knew that I had found my soul mate. The necklace had done its job, and I was grateful for the gift that my family had given me.Years went by, and we were happily married. The necklace had been passed down through generations, and now it was our turn to pass it on to our child. We knew that it would find their soul mate, just as it had found ours.Looking back, I realized that the necklace had been a constant reminder that true love was out there, waiting to be found. It had been a source of comfort and hope, and had brought me the greatest joy of my life. I was grateful for the family heirloom, and for the love that it had brought into my life.",

Now, I only drive from Pittsburgh to Breezewood, and it’s $12.60 one way. And this isn’t even halfway to Philadelphia. In theory, you can avoid the turnpike by taking I-80, but this road is impassable in the snow. And there aren’t as many rest stops. So, Pennsylvania knows you have no choice, and they can charge whatever they want on the turnpike. FYI... Prices are scheduled to go up on January 1, 2015. Well, that’s good news. The toll booth operators don’t know how much the increase will be. One toll booth operator got annoyed when I asked her.",

The combination of food was served in generous portions at a great price (under five bucks). One random note: I liked the tables and chairs. It may sound silly, and at first I thought so too. They were comfortable not only for sitting and reading the paper with a cup of coffee, but also for sitting and eating. The distance between the tables and chairs was just right. I don't know why, but when I go to a restaurant and the booths are too wide or too narrow, it can spoil my meal. Marge's Place was a pleasant surprise. Not only will I return, but I will recommend it to anyone in the area. I like places like this, neighborhood businesses that make everyone feel welcome.",

The lazio lasagna florentino was basically two huge layers of noodles with a huge pile of spinach in the middle (I’m talking a three-inch pile of clumped spinach) and a few mushrooms. The spinach to noodle ratio was out of control and I honestly could only eat a few bites before I couldn’t even finish it. My friend ordered off the regular menu, which the waitress warned us not to do because her food would come out at a different time. The panna cotta was the best thing we ordered. We tried my friend’s appetizer, the Italian fries, which were described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge, but were just a bowl of regular French fries, which was disappointing and misleading. Why? I don’t know. There wasn’t one thing we ate that was impressive. She also ordered the house soup with chickpeas, which looked like a bowl of alphabet soup and tasted even worse. I wasted my money and I will never, ever go back. Everything was overpriced and below average.",

We were supposed to share but we each ate our own sandwich. The bread is two thick slices of soft Italian white bread. They put at least half a pound of meat on it, lots of cheese, tomatoes and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayo-based one I was expecting). Here's the breakdown: The coleslaw is more like a shredded cabbage salad, the dressing is tangy and vinegary. The fries are fresh and reminiscent of boardwalk fries, only better. The piece de resistance is the huge pile of fries in the middle of the sandwich. They had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar on the table! All I needed was some Old Bay and it would have been perfect. Maybe next time I'll bring some in my purse. I ate the whole thing and I needed a nap afterwards. Sssh! I ate it. I saw it.

The server was nice, that’s not the issue. The issue is that they were grossly understaffed. We finished our drinks and left. The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with “this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar gets swamped.” This is a sign that you need more staff. They had two bartenders and not nearly enough cocktail servers. We ended up not ordering food because we were worried about time, not because we didn’t get happy hour prices. I’ve never had this happen at any other bar. Get more staff. We ended up going to the Improv and getting food there. Bar Louie lost a lot of money because of their lack of staff and they will never get our business again or our friends who live in the area.

A few minutes later the other bartender came over with my water and gave me a menu. I didn’t have a martini, but there were a few drink choices on the menu. I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that. I ordered a turkey wrap with a side of fruit salad. It seemed to take forever to come out. I say “a” turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive. The fruit salad looked like it was ready for the garbage, so I skipped it. Considering it wasn’t busy, it did take a long time to come out. When it did, it looked OK. It was very disappointing. The wrap had no flavor and was loaded with lettuce. Too much lettuce.

People were fighting to get in. It wasn't very impressive to me. I did like the wave pool. It was also crowded, but it was big enough for everyone to fit comfortably. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me feel disgusting. The water was clean (a big plus) and the waves were strong. I could have stayed in there the whole time. All in all, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't really \"wow\" me, but if you live in the area and have kids and are looking for something to do in the summer other than go to the mall, this is a good place to take them.",

The iceberg lettuce, olive, and tomato salad, oh yeah, it also had a little chicken on it, was fine once I scraped off all the orange congealed “cheese.” The balsamic dressing I ordered was replaced by a raspberry vinaigrette, which was so disgusting I had to go back to the restaurant to get the right dressing, which they were out of. It would have been nice if they had asked me, since they had Italian dressing, which would have been a better match. This place is a total dump.

The fact that we had no trouble finding a seat at the bar or a table was very pleasant. The place was only half full (on the opening day of the Bucs!). The food was okay. I tried the nachos, which were good and interesting because they had a decent sausage and not just ground beef. I ordered the lobster roll. I also really liked the sweet potato fries. They were delicious and you don’t get them very often. I also tried the tortilla soup, which was very rich and spicy. There was a lot of lobster, but some of it was a little overcooked and it was ice cold. I can understand that it’s served cool, although I prefer it warm, but ice cold is not good, especially when they put warm butter on it. The only thing missing from the soup was the tortilla chips. A minor oversight, I’m sure. All in all, a pretty decent place to have a few beers with friends. I have also been to the upstairs bar, which is more upscale. The happy hour is good, but it’s pretty empty after 8 p.m. The bar is huge, which is good, and there are plenty of seats, including leather couches. The food is a little better than average.

I had to ask for the menus about five or ten minutes after we were seated. To be fair, our waitress was very nice. She was friendly and approachable. But of course, when the food came, mine was cold. The potatoes in the hash I ordered were old, stale and cold, and the bread that came with it was so small. I know I may sound a little snobbish, but utensils should be given before the food.

Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. They allowed her to use her Groupon and gave her a confirmation number and everything! When I called, I was told I couldn't use my Groupon. It was a classic bait and switch. These comedians were not Special Events until after the Groupon was released. Many of my friends have had the same experience. Besides, other restrictions, such as not being able to use the Groupon on Saturdays and having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were not listed in the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. So tonight, my friends and I had pretty much resolved ourselves to not going to the Improv because they wouldn't let us use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with Katrina so she could get her tickets. They wouldn't give her the tickets. Surprise! They didn't have her name or her reservation in their system! It's a joke. How is anyone going to use their Groupons by September if all the shows are now Special Events? My friends and I (about ten of us) are all getting refunds from Groupon and/or our credit card companies, and we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. Besides, no one at the Improv answers the phone or responds to emails. They are extremely shady and don't care about their customers.",

But I think that has more to do with my tastes (remember, I’m not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than with the shop itself—you can always find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, despite my snobbery, I’ve never left empty-handed, and I’ve always left with a case of Woodchuck, and most recently a case of Woodchuck’s Fall. (Yum!) Also, the men behind the counter are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand getting your purchases to your car. But the parking situation is what keeps me from giving this place four stars. Getting into the lot can be a little scary, as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down as you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny, so if too many people stop in for beer at once, it can get a little crowded. Be prepared to sit for a few minutes if traffic is heavy. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than getting in, because no one ever slows down on Banksville Road to let you out. Happy shopping, beer lovers!",

At 7:30 a.m., the assumption in a coffee shop three blocks from a major freeway entrance should be that people are on their way to work or are generally not interested in a leisurely 15-minute wait for a latte. But after one of the three employees rang me up, I waited several minutes while the barista took her time making the person ahead of me a cappuccino. She literally pulled an espresso shot, stood there for a few seconds talking to the other girl, steamed the milk, then stood there, and so on. When she finally finished the other person's drink, she wiped down her area and took her time starting on mine. Meanwhile, she and one of the other employees started arguing with each other, and she did nothing. It was very obvious that I was waiting and that she was wasting time. Finally, I tried to make eye contact with one of them, because I was in a hurry to get back to Milwaukee. She finally made my drink, slooooooowly. As an aside, I'm not a particularly uptight or fast-paced person, but customer service that doesn't focus on the customer really gets on my nerves, and there's no excuse for ignoring a customer in a coffee shop at 7:30 in the morning.

One would think that any restaurant in America’s Dairyland, especially a chain restaurant that has been around for decades, could serve breakfast without screwing it up. One order was steak and eggs, the steak medium and the eggs over easy. What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak, not rare, but raw, and the eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge. Some of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy. Another order of scrambled eggs, mine, had a long, thin, hair-like thread of indeterminate origin. One does not expect to break a tooth on scrambled eggs, but not one, not two, but three two-inch pieces of that translucent crust ended up in the folded, dry “scrambled eggs.” When I pulled it out of my mouth, it broke in two and curled up like a piece of elastic. Was it a thread from a hair net? Was it a human hair? The manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, and we told her. She took twenty percent off our bill, but the food was overpriced at any discount. Our waitress was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things right—the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrible!

Also, a nice older gentleman came around and asked how we were doing, if he could be of help, and if he could clear our plates. Now, my friends’ plates. It’s hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowder, but not enough clams, too uniformly cut potatoes, and lots of emulsifiers do not a chowder make. The baked potato with cheese was enormous. I’m not kidding, it could have been used as a regulation football. The potato soup was described as hot and creamy, and the half turkey club was quite large and nicely put together. I know I’m going overboard on the size of the potato, but it looked so good! Where the hell do they find potatoes that big? It had two kinds of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella. The total for all this was about $24.00.

The inside is much nicer, decorated with local Wisconsin artifacts and pictures. My favorite was the old beer bottle collection at the entrance. We were seated right away and our waitress was a super friendly and super nice lady. We asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great, and after eating there, I believe her. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my son got the fish fry. My son’s fish was very good, not greasy, light and flaky. When she brought the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was so much food! The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter sauce and I love spicy, so she brought me one. My pulled pork was excellent. The sauces on the table were also very good. Smoky and spicy. If you’re looking for good, casual, non-pretentious BBQ, this is the place for you! Don’t let the outside fool you, the inside is clean and the food is excellent and they give you a ton of it!",

I suppose the insurance company didn’t cover the cost of a new broom, a vacuum cleaner, and cleaning supplies. The waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah. It was 2 p.m. on a Saturday, and the place was empty. No excuse for the dirt. I ordered a gyro sandwich. She was friendly and attentive. She’s the only reason I’d give this place a star. I ordered the broccoli cheese soup. I think if I heated up some Velveeta and poured a gallon of water over it, then threw in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe. It came with fries and a bowl of soup. When the gyro arrived, it smelled like a rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy, and the fries were colder than a December day in Alaska. I’m not joking. I wish the rest of the meal had been as good. Sarah noticed that I hadn’t eaten my food, and she offered to take it off the bill without my asking. I would have applauded her gesture, but an older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that. The gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit it out into a napkin and chug a glass of water to wash out the taste of horse dung. I couldn’t choke down another bite of the garbage they call food. “I’ll make you a new sandwich,” the old lady said. I declined. I wonder how many people have done what I did. I paid my nine dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left. I bet the Dairy Queen across the street is glad Sir Hobo’s is back in business. Never again. I’ll go to Dairy Queen instead. I walked over to Dairy Queen and had an ice cream cone to try to wash the taste of death and decay out of my mouth.",

But for the big dogs that take too long or are too difficult for us to control, it is absolutely worth having someone else do it. The others either never needed to be cut or were so small that it was not worth it. On the downside, they are a bit expensive. For a bath and a cut (or a cut and a bath, I do not know in which order they do it) it was $ 70, and that was a while ago. Then you need a professional, and they take care of it.

Be warned: the fee is an unreasonable $3, but since I doubt this thing ever works, you won’t pay it (and you won’t get any cash). Worse, after staring at the screen for six minutes while it read “Transaction Processing,” the ATM failed to work and spit out a receipt that said “Transaction Failed.” With the ATM down, I headed to the fountain so I could buy a Diet Coke and get cash back at the register. The prices are outrageous. I’m not surprised, nor am I complaining, because it’s no secret that Walgreens charges a premium for everything. The Diet Coke was about 30 cents more than anywhere else. The line at the register is slow. One cashier. I got in line with my Diet Coke. I was seventh in line. When I went to pay and hit the “cash back” button, the kid who was running the newly opened register informed me that he didn’t have any change. Ugh.

The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic and surprisingly they still have some of the old school ones, Gold Rush and Thunder Road. This place has been around forever and it seems to have kept up with the times. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full blast, so thank God for the water park, it was a great way to cool off.

The preserved, pickled thing is inescapable - if it's not a roasted pepper overwhelming your salad, it's a pickled artichoke or so many Kalamata olives (yay Greece!) smothering your pizza that you can't even taste the house-made mozzarella. Even the bruschette tastes like it's been doused with anti-aging liquids and sat at the bottom of a very deep, very cold refrigerator for who knows how long. Service is probably where they've spent the most energy, and it shows - the people are quick, smiley, and knowledgeable. That's not how they do it in Italy, kids! That's how they do it in Breadstickville. But try number three was this past weekend, and the benedict was so Stouffer's (accompanied by the blandest breakfast potatoes I've ever not eaten, and seriously, what kind of cheese was that under my two asparagus spears? Muenster? Really?) that, as I said, I give up. What a disappointment.",

I thought it would be a great place to hold a wedding, but I would not want my guests to stay in the room I stayed in, if they are all pretty much the same. I also felt that the three stars were mainly due to the rooftop pool, which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better.

It was served with local field peas, sweet corn, wood-fired tomatoes, bacon, and ramp vinaigrette.

I had a bite of my boyfriend's steak and eggs, which were overcooked and greasy. I don't like greasy food, and he said it was pretty average, if a little overcooked for his taste. I thought the food was a little overpriced for the quality, but it's pretty standard for the area. If I went back, I would order something much lighter. Now, I know you're probably thinking, \"Well, it's your fault for ordering such rich food!\" And maybe that's true, but I've had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that were just as rich but somehow less of a grease bath for my mouth. So for me, Mert's is just okay. On the plus side, the service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation.",

Friday and Saturday nights are great for dancing stupidly (but enthusiastically) with your friends to 80s music. I love the hits from my school years. (Though I wish the DJ would play less Prince and Michael Jackson and give some other artists their due.) Thursdays used to be New Wave night, which was fun for the goths and goth wannabes—you just had to wear black that night!—but now Thursdays are apparently Hip Hop night. I'm not sure how much Hip Hop is 80s, but whatever. The Breakfast Club is perfect for birthday parties, girls' nights out, etc.—for those of us in our 30s and 40s who don't go out every week like we used to, but still like to let our hair down once or twice a year.

Located about a mile from the center of downtown and the convention center, it is far enough away to be out of the hustle and bustle, but close enough to walk to the convention center and downtown restaurants if you want to. I like a good shower with good water pressure. The open shower was not my favorite. The room had a safe, but otherwise no bling. The shower in this room had a seat and a hand-held shower head. To be fair, the shower head was on a holder that could be adjusted for height and direction, but the water pressure was not good. There was no tub. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Check-in was easy, and check-out was done by phone from the room. Any more water and you would have flooded the bathroom. The bar and restaurant are typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. The final bill is slipped under your door on the morning you check out. Subway, The Great Wok, and Cedar Street Tavern are all within a short walk and are fine if you don’t want to go downtown for better dining. There is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within a short walk. The hotel has a parking garage next door for $13 a day. In-room Internet is $9.95 for 24 hours. I understand a charge for parking, but it seems a bit steep. I don’t understand any hotel that charges for in-room Internet when it is free in the lobby and other public areas. Minor quibbles, but if I were attending a multi-day conference at the convention center, I would look for a hotel closer. It would probably cost about the same, and the convenience would be better.",

After four minutes, the song was over and I was about to pay her thirty dollars plus a tip, when she explained that I actually owed her sixty dollars because it was two songs. By my reckoning, it was one dance. This beautiful angel suddenly turned into a crazy devil. Apparently, she considered the five minutes of conversation over the drink I had bought her to be part of the dance. I thought she was joking and gave her the thirty dollars. I explained the situation to the manager, but he insisted that I pay up, which I did. She called the manager and made me out to be a crazy, cheap bastard. I made a quick exit. I had been in the club for less than ten minutes and had not even finished my first beer, so I was not drunk. Unless you don’t mind being ripped off by a dancer and paying sixty dollars for a four-minute dance, I would avoid this place.

It dawned on me that in the Carolinas, bbq is pork, like the chopped sandwich I ordered. But I had to try the food. I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was vinegary and the meat was tender and juicy with a nice crunch. The chopped sandwich was decent, but it didn't really taste smoked. I put some coleslaw on it and it was a nice sandwich. I won't call it bbq, but I will call it good! Would I recommend the Bbq King? Yes, it was unique enough to say yes, but with full disclosure. Would I go back?

Because I wanted an entree with chicken as the main ingredient, and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I’m not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya). And it was brought to the table without an apology. Finally, after several reminders, our waiter forgot to bring us drinks and bread, and then messed up our bills (yes, we were splitting the bill).

As luck would have it, our local Restaurant Week also coincided with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed four different glasses of red wine for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't believe what a great deal we'd gotten! I could go on and on about why the Capital Grille is my favorite restaurant, but you'll just have to experience it for yourself to understand.",

The staff is nice, they are relatively attentive and all, but it just seems so wrong. It's a nice place, and you really don't have to dress up — we went in jeans — but it's just so \"pretty.\" I'd rather go somewhere a bit shabby. Anyway, the menus came, and we decided to try the spring rolls as an appetizer, and they were actually quite good. I liked that they split the appetizer between two plates, that's a nice touch. That's cool. Most places give you one plate and you have to split it yourself. Another nice touch is that the bread comes with melted butter. I ordered the sea bass, which the waiter recommended as the best thing on the menu, and my wife had the sirloin. The fish had a good flavor, but it was so spongey that it was hard to eat. The texture was just so strange. The steak, on the other hand, was really good. All in all, it was decent, but not cheap. Strange, for a fish place. I think we'd rather go to the much more fun and much better McCormick & Schmick's. It's more our style, and the food is usually better, and it's cheaper, too.",

The sauce was a sweet-spicy combination, and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried (i.e., not greasy). I ended up sharing with the boyfriend, because his food was way better than mine. The only downside was that the cherries were maraschino cherries, and they tasted exactly like what you'd expect: like they came straight from a Shirley Temple. Too sweet and not very appetizing.

Anyway, we’ve been burned by these fusion places before, but this place ROCKED THE PAD THAI! It was the best, most authentic (yes, I’ve been to Thailand) dish I’ve had in a long time. But I digress. So we had to go back. The second time, we had a larger group, and the food wasn’t quite as hot. It was still good, but I was shocked by how good it was.

Crack is whack. nnOne bad thing about this place is that you occasionally have a random person walking around asking if you want to buy drugs.",

You order first, then take a seat, which means you wait at the counter until someone gets up and leaves. Serious coffee drinkers will know what I mean. n- It's like eating breakfast in someone's basement. n- The staff pretends not to see you until a table opens up. I understand, but a little courtesy, even if it's fake, would be nice. n- The crepes are really damn good. I'll be back soon.",

My companion had a hearty and tasty mushroom soup and a nicely grilled salmon. I had grilled octopus, which was tender and seasoned with a tangy vinaigrette. For dessert, I had budino di nutella, a chocolate pudding. Unfortunately, it looked better on the menu. It was a bit too heavy and rich. Perhaps I should have learned my lesson.

I would like to try it again, but I would order something other than pasta. I’m a tough critic when it comes to Italian food. My biggest complaint was the speed of the service. I don’t know if the waitress (or the chef) had somewhere to be, but she was going a mile a minute.

We had barely settled in when my cousin came running into our room, screaming like a banshee, with her hands covered in soap. \"It doesn't come off!\" she screamed. It turned out that every brown piece of furniture in all the suites was covered with furniture polish, which stained our clothes and stuck to our hands. We called the office and waited for ten minutes. Finally, we went across the street, and the staff was very gracious. They apologized profusely, offered to pay for our laundry, and removed the guilty furniture from our rooms. Everything went well until check-out day. We were on our way to a college graduation ceremony and wanted to drive, but we had to walk because of the Pittsburgh Marathon. We received a handwritten apology from the management and two bottles of cheap merlot. nnWhen we called the office to ask if we could leave our luggage in our rooms for a half hour after check-out, they flatly refused. After a fit of temper and a reminder of the soap incident, they finally allowed us to leave our cars in the lot with our luggage in the trunk, which they had initially refused to allow.

The place reeks of stale cigarette smoke (and this is coming from a smoker) that hits you like a ton of bricks the moment you walk in.

I ordered a glass of wine and beer for my companions. I felt as if I was going to pass out. I sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said, \"Oh, I would have gotten that for you,\" in a very snotty tone, as if we had broken some unspoken rule by not asking her for it when she was obviously not paying attention. We ordered some cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it wasn't. The waitress could tell I was having some kind of problem and brought us our check \"in case you need to leave suddenly.\" They were frozen and certainly not worth the price. She never asked if I was okay, needed her to call someone, needed help of any kind, but was more concerned about collecting the bill than the well-being of her customers. REALLY? I will never go back there again. By the way, two beers, a glass of wine (which I didn't even drink) and an order of cheese sticks (frozen and not very good) came to almost $22! What a rip-off!",

I asked the waitress about it, and she said, “They always cook it rare.” I know that most German menus don’t have crab cakes, but most good restaurants do, so it’s pretty standard fare. The crab cakes: Their famous salad, with baby greens on top of a delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad, and a wonderful German potato salad. This dish is amazing! Their crab cakes are very crabby, but they also have either curry or turmeric in them, which is quite unexpected and doesn’t add anything to the dish. The salad is the only reason we go back to Waldhorn’s. We’ve been regulars for over ten years, but this weekend was probably our last visit.

Then we got some story about how they only have six receivers. Not ESPN U or ESPN 360 or anything fancy, just plain old regular ESPN. Seriously. Fine. But why am I watching the game between Maine and Iowa? The nachos were disgusting and my wrap was just a greasy mess. The fries were even worse, but I found that if you dipped them in the disgusting nacho cheese, they weren't so bad. I was also annoyed that when a cute girl walked up to the bar, the Georgia game was on in minutes. The beer was four-fifty-five! Multiply that by a three-hour game and you're paying a lot. The service was awful and I think I'd get better reception on a TV with rabbit ears. In the end, this place sucked, although I will give them credit for finally getting the game on when we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish bar that had a working receiver. If you're ever in Pittsburgh and want to watch some ESPN, here's my advice: Grab a sandwich from Permaniti Brothers and a six-pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room. It'll be cheaper than sitting in a bar watching Maine and Iowa on a crappy little TV with bad reception.",

Hot dogs, burgers, BLTs, sandwiches, fries, onion rings, etc. Exactly what you would expect from a two-basket deep fryer, a griddle, and a condiment bar. Not bad for a two-dollar dog. “All the way” means mustard, ketchup, chili, onions, and slaw. For an extra fifty cents, you get half slices of American cheese under all that.

The front desk girl and the shuttle driver were nice, but that's about all I can say about this experience. Next, we went to the lobby to eat dinner. When we tried to order, we were told that they were \"out\" of both items we ordered. Then, the items we ordered tasted like a Stouffer's microwave dinner, and the dessert was rubbery and a waste of money. Next, when we went to get ready in the morning, we had to bathe in our own dirt because the shower drain was clogged. I literally filled the bathtub with water, and it didn't drain until we were almost ready to check out. That's just nasty! Next, my husband asked if the hotel had a kiosk to check in for our flight (many hotels have this now). The employee said no, but he directed us to the business center to print our boarding passes from their computer. He failed to mention that the printer was broken. I usually don't pay full price for hotels or book through full-price sites, but we wanted to be close to the airport, and until now, I've always had good things to say about Starwood hotels (owners of Sheraton, Westin, W, Four Points, etc.). So I went through all this trouble for nothing. I've had a better stay at a Holiday Inn booked through Hotwire for $85! We paid about $200 for the room before taxes and fees, and I will never do that again. Also, no free WiFi. That pretty much puts this hotel on the \"no-go\" list.",

I went in to get some last-minute food for the family and was immediately suspicious when I saw half a dozen people milling around in the food-pickup area, and no one was giving them food. Ever. I noticed that half the staff seemed to be sitting in the dining room watching TV. When I questioned the cashier about the delay, another customer actually came back and demanded a refund because she couldn’t wait any longer. I have frequented this store many times, and I have definitely noticed a pattern of very poor and incompetent service. There are always staff members hanging around doing nothing, playing with the TV, or, in one case, rapping behind the counter. Almost every order I have placed has had something forgotten or incorrect. I have had enough of this store, and I plan to avoid it until they get some people who are actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same. I wouldn’t even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen. UPDATE: I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he briefly responded that it was a situation that was being addressed. So I went back and got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time, and everyone on the staff was, if not working, at least not blatantly goofing off. So I added a star to the rating, even though I’m still a little wary.",

But when I went to sign the lease, they told me I would. I rushed to contact my mother, who was willing to cosign, but they said they needed BOTH parents to cosign, and they wanted me to sign an agreement saying I would forfeit the $1000 deposit I had to pay up front if I didn’t return all the cosigner documents within seven days. This was a problem because one of my parents was out of town for the week. I tried to compromise with them and see if they could change the agreement to give me an extra few days to get the cosigner paperwork in, or to see if I could just have my mother (who was more than financially stable) be the sole cosigner. They weren’t willing to compromise at all, and I left after about a half hour of unproductive back-and-forth. I wouldn’t say never rent from them, but I would definitely be aware of how rude and difficult they can be. I could have gone back a week later, when both my parents were in town, and the apartment was still available, but I figured a place that was that difficult to work with when I was trying to give them money would be even more difficult to deal with when I needed to contact them for things like maintenance.",

We were sitting at Mario’s across the street, and he said to me, “Do you want to go somewhere else and have some strong drinks?” This not only excited me, but also aroused my curiosity. Where were we going and why didn’t I know about this place? This place is a dive, but not dirty. It looks like it was decorated about 25 years ago, and if it was good enough then, it’s good enough now. Once you get inside and up the long flight of stairs (I can see myself taking a tumble down them after a few Manhattans), you enter the dark, smoky bar. The bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar. He makes his drinks fast, tall, and strong. The jukebox is loaded with classic jazz and blues, and normally it’s operated by the bartender, which is fine by me, because he has good taste. You get a rocks glass with a little ice, filled almost to the top with your liquor of choice, and a mist of whatever else you want to water it down. The average drink (whiskey and coke, vodka and tonic, gin and tonic) costs about $6, and some of the others (Manhattan, martini, etc.) cost $8. The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, it’s worth it. If you want to listen to some good music, get schwacked on liquor, and have a good conversation, this is the place. If I’m going to spend $15 in a bar, I’d rather have two strong drinks than 15 cups of coke with an eyedropper full of liquor.",

I ordered one of the daily specials, chicken in a spicy peanut sauce. It came with white rice, a green salad (two slices of tomato, two olives, red onion, and a light dressing), and two slices of French bread. The chicken was delicious—the sauce had a wonderful peanut flavor, and it went perfectly with the rice. The bread was pretty ordinary, so I used it to sop up the leftover sauce. I also liked the salad—the dressing was tasty, and I love olives. The sweet potato fries that came with the meal were a real treat. My boyfriend ordered ropa vieja, which I tried a bite of. It wasn’t as meaty as I would have liked, but it was very juicy and tasty. Everyone really enjoyed their meal. It’s a good place to spend your money.

From the moment I stepped inside, the atmosphere felt lackluster and uninspiring. The dimly lit space exuded a sense of gloom, making it difficult to truly enjoy the dining experience. The staff seemed disengaged and unattentive, as if they were going through the motions without any genuine interest in their customers' satisfaction.The menu options were limited and unimaginative, offering nothing that stood out or piqued my curiosity. I opted for a burger, hoping it would at least be a safe choice. However, it arrived overcooked and dry, lacking any discernible flavor. The accompanying fries were underwhelming, as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long.Furthermore, the prices at Bar Louie were surprisingly high for the quality of food and service provided. I felt like I was paying a premium for mediocrity. The lack of attention to detail was evident throughout the entire experience. Even the presentation of the dishes was lackluster, with no thoughtful touches or artistic flair.To make matters worse, the noise level in the restaurant was unbearable. Conversations were drowned out by blaring music and rowdy patrons, making it difficult to have a pleasant conversation or enjoy a meal in peace. The cramped seating arrangement only exacerbated the issue, leaving no room for personal space or comfort.In conclusion, my visit to Bar Louie was disappointing, to say the least. The lackluster atmosphere, disinterested staff, subpar food, high prices, and overwhelming noise level were all contributing factors to my decision to avoid this place in the future. There are plenty of other dining options in the area that offer a far superior experience for a similar price point. Bar Louie will not be seeing me as a returning customer anytime soon.",

The options were limited, and there was a lack of innovative dishes that would usually tempt my taste buds. Despite my reservations, I decided to order their signature breakfast platter, hoping it would redeem the underwhelming first impression. Regrettably, the disappointment permeated through every aspect of the meal. The platter arrived lukewarm, and the eggs were overcooked, leaving them rubbery and devoid of any flavor.

The waitstaff seemed disinterested, barely acknowledging our presence and displaying a noticeable lack of attentiveness. All in all, my visit to the Rusty Nail fell far below the hype and failed to deliver the satisfying breakfast experience I had anticipated.

        "text": "I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay. While it may seem convenient to pay upfront for a product or service, it often leaves you vulnerable and at the mercy of the provider. Time and time again, I've seen instances where pre-paying has led to disappointment and frustration.One of the main reasons to avoid pre-paying is that it relinquishes your ability to hold the provider accountable. Once they have your money, there's little incentive for them to prioritize your needs or deliver on their promises. It's always better to maintain some leverage by keeping your payment contingent upon satisfactory results.Furthermore, pre-paying can be financially risky. Circumstances change, businesses go under, and unforeseen events can derail plans. If you've already paid in full, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover your hard-earned money. Protecting your financial interests should always be a priority.Another drawback of pre-paying is that it limits your flexibility. Life is unpredictable, and we often need to make adjustments to our plans. By pre-paying, you lock yourself into a specific arrangement, leaving little room for changes or cancellations without potentially losing money. Opting for payment upon completion or after receiving the product allows for greater adaptability.Moreover, pre-paying can result in a diminished level of service. Providers may feel less obligated to go the extra mile or provide top-notch assistance if they have already received payment in full. In many cases, the quality of service tends to decline once the transaction is complete, leaving you feeling dissatisfied and taken advantage of.Additionally, pre-paying can make it challenging to address any issues that may arise. Suppose you've already paid before realizing that there are defects, problems, or discrepancies. In that case, resolving these matters can become a daunting task.",

Our determination and mutual support strengthened the bond between us, making the experience even more memorable.Hours later, we conquered the summit, greeted by an awe-inspiring panorama that made the arduous journey worth every drop of sweat. We found a perfect vantage point to witness the setting sun painting the sky in hues of gold and pink. It was a magical moment, etching itself into our memories forever.With spirits uplifted, we began our descent, reflecting on the incredible adventure we had shared. The mountain had tested our physical and mental strength, but it had also rewarded us with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for the beauty of the natural world.As nightfall approached, we returned to the base, tired but satisfied. A cozy bonfire awaited us, where we shared stories and laughter, cherishing the camaraderie forged during our climb.",

As I walked through the doors of the store, I couldn't help but notice the nostalgic ambiance that enveloped the space. The familiar blue and white color scheme brought back memories of my childhood shopping trips. However, as I ventured deeper into the store, it became apparent that Kmart was struggling to keep up with the changing times.The once bustling aisles now appeared sparse, with shelves displaying a limited selection of products. It seemed as though Kmart had lost its competitive edge against online retailers and larger chain stores. The lack of modernization was evident in the outdated displays and cramped layout, making it difficult to navigate through the cluttered sections.I noticed that the staff seemed disengaged and unenthusiastic, which further contributed to the lackluster shopping experience. There was a noticeable absence of customer service, leaving me feeling as though I was simply another anonymous face in the crowd.Despite its shortcomings, Kmart still managed to retain some loyal customers, evident by a few people browsing the aisles. The store did have its redeeming qualities, such as an impressive selection of affordable home goods and discounted clothing items. Bargain hunters might still find solace in the store's wide range of lower-priced products.One aspect that stood out to me was the clearance section, where I stumbled upon some great deals on discontinued items. However, the overall organization of the store made it challenging to locate specific items or even find assistance when needed.As I made my way to the checkout counter, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of sadness. Kmart, once an icon of American retail, was now a faded relic of the past. The decline of this once-thriving store mirrored the changing landscape of the retail industry.In conclusion, while Darren's review sparked my curiosity, my personal experience at Kmart left much to be desired.",

The slow-braised veal shank was incredibly tender, practically falling off the bone, and the gremolata topping added a refreshing tanginess to the dish. It was accompanied by a creamy saffron risotto that was absolutely heavenly. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that every bite was a satisfying experience.To complete my meal, I indulged in a traditional tiramisu, and it was the perfect finale.

He seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic, merely going through the motions without any of the flair and showmanship we had come to expect from a teppanyaki chef. The food itself was mediocre at best, with the flavors lacking depth and the ingredients appearing subpar.Furthermore, the once vibrant and lively atmosphere of the restaurant seemed strangely dull that night. The background music was barely audible, and the absence of cheerful chatter and laughter made the experience feel strangely somber. It was as if the soul of the restaurant had taken an unwelcome hiatus.As the evening progressed, we found ourselves constantly seeking the attention of the waitstaff, who seemed more interested in conversing amongst themselves than tending to the needs of the diners. Our requests for additional condiments and refills fell on deaf ears, leaving us feeling neglected and disheartened.",

The moment we walked in, we were greeted with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling meats and freshly baked bread. The atmosphere was lively, bustling with locals and tourists alike, creating a vibrant energy that added to the overall experience.The menu at Primanti Bros is a carnivore's dream come true. With a wide selection of sandwiches piled high with meat, cheese, and coleslaw, it's hard to decide where to begin. I opted for their classic \"Almost Famous\" sandwich, which featured thick cuts of pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and a generous helping of their signature coleslaw, all sandwiched between two slices of soft Italian bread. Each bite was a perfect balance of flavors and textures, with the tanginess of the coleslaw complementing the rich, savory pastrami.What sets Primanti Bros apart from other sandwich joints is their unique addition of fries directly into the sandwich. This unconventional twist adds an extra layer of indulgence and a satisfying crunch to every bite. The fries were perfectly cooked, golden and crispy on the outside, while still tender on the inside. It's a deliciously messy experience that you quickly get the hang of, and it's worth every napkin you go through.Apart from their famous sandwiches, Primanti Bros also offers a variety of other dishes to satisfy different cravings. Their loaded nachos were a hit at our table, piled high with melted cheese, tangy jalapeños, and a heaping serving of their homemade chili. The combination of flavors was fantastic and made for a great sharable appetizer.The service at Primanti Bros was friendly and efficient, with the staff providing helpful recommendations and ensuring our glasses were always filled. The wait for a table was understandable given the restaurant's popularity, but it was well worth it once we were seated.",

It seemed like a missed opportunity for the restaurant to showcase their best dishes. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try and filled my plate with whatever was available. Unfortunately, the lack of variety and freshness was evident in every bite. The food that had sat out for too long had lost its flavor and texture, leaving me underwhelmed.Furthermore, the limited options made it challenging to find something that suited my dietary preferences. I was hoping for a decent selection of vegetarian and vegan options, but I was left with just a couple of uninspiring choices. The lack of consideration for different dietary needs was disappointing. Additionally, the food temperature was not well-maintained, contributing to its unappetizing state.The service, however, was friendly and attentive, with the staff doing their best to keep up with the busy rush. I appreciated their efforts, but it was clear that they were stretched thin, which affected the overall dining experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant, with a cozy and inviting atmosphere, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the lackluster food. In conclusion, based on my experience during the dinner rush, I cannot recommend visiting the hot bar at this particular time. It might be worth giving it another chance during a different part of the day when the food is freshly replenished.",

Our server, who never introduced herself or even cracked a smile the entire time she \"waited\" on us, pretty much ruined the whole dining experience. There were only two other tables occupied in the entire restaurant, so it's not like she was slammed. She pretty much ignored us the entire time, which was super annoying since we were starving and thirsty.We finally flagged her down to order drinks and an appetizer and she never came back to check on us once during the entire meal. My husband had to get up and go to the bar to get our own drinks. When the food finally arrived, it was only lukewarm at best and my husband's burger was so overcooked it was like eating cardboard. My fish and chips were okay but nothing special.To top off the whole horrible experience, when we went to pay the bill, she had the audacity to ask us how everything was. We told her the service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best and she didn't even apologize or offer to make it right. We will never be back!The only saving grace was the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is really nice, very clean and decorated in a fun, nautical theme.

They were hesitant because they are vegetarian, but I assured them that there would be plenty of options. They were right to be skeptical; there was only one vegetarian entree on the menu, and it was a spicy tofu dish. It didn’t sound very good, so one of our friends decided to just get a side of white rice, while the other had an egg foo yung. I ordered the sesame chicken, which our server said was the most popular dish on the menu. He also brought a big bowl of steaming white rice for the three of us to share.We started with an order of spring rolls which were deep fried to a golden brown and served with the typical dipping sauce. They were delicious. Our entrees also came fairly quickly. My sesame chicken was tasty, but the breading was a little thick. The white rice was fluffy and moist, just like it should be. Our friend with the white rice said that it was cooked perfectly. The egg foo yung was light and fluffy with plenty of vegetables. The tofu was nicely fried, but it was just too spicy for my friend. Our server was very attentive and friendly. He kept our water glasses full and even brought us more white rice when we asked.All in all, our experience was okay. The service was good, and the spring rolls, sesame chicken and white rice were delicious. However, there weren't many vegetarian options and the tofu dish was too spicy, so I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to vegetarians.",

Within the first few minutes I was already jumping at any loud sounds. The plot centers around a family that moves into a supposedly haunted house. Strange noises and sightings immediately start to happen. It seems this house has a dark past that is now haunting the new family. As the movie progresses, the paranormal activity escalates into truly frightening encounters. Objects start moving on their own and disturbing messages appear on the walls.  No one in the family is safe from the malicious spirits. The family desperately tries to escape the house but it seems the entity is too powerful. I found myself unable to look away despite how scary some of the scenes were. By the end I felt completely unsettled and on edge. It took me a while to get to sleep that night as my imagination ran wild. If you consider yourself a scaredy-cat, I'd strongly advise waiting for this one to come out on video. Overall it's an exceptionally well-made ghost story that will leave you shaken. Just don't watch it alone!",

It's also conveniently located close to my home, so it's an easy choice for a casual weekend breakfast. On slower weekday mornings, the experience is much more relaxed. I've never had a truly bad meal here, even if it's not the highest cuisine. Overall, while not the top restaurant in town, it fulfills my breakfast needs and puts me in a good mood.

We were seated right away even though it was pretty busy for a Monday. The decor had an upbeat, modern vibe which I thought fit well with the menu. We started by sharing an appetizer of truffle fries that were topped with Parmesan and herbs. Those fries were insanely good, the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. For our mains, I had the barbecue chicken sandwich which came with coleslaw and chips. It was a generous portion and everything was very fresh tasting. My wife enjoyed the fish tacos that featured seasoned mahi mahi. My dad chose the burger which he said was one of the juiciest he's had. Grandpa stuck with something lighter and opted for the soup and salad combo. The server was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. I had a local craft beer to drink that went well with the food. Overall we were all very satisfied with our choices and the experience. The prices were also reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. I'll have to come back next time I'm in Charlotte to try something different from the menu. This place would be a great choice for both dining in or getting takeout.

They spent quite a while reading all the information panels and observing the dinosaurs move. The science gallery allowed for many hands-on experiments that kept everyone engaged. One exhibit let us create circuits to light up different colored bulbs. In the nature center we saw taxidermy animals and got to touch seashells and fossils. The IMAX theater was showing a new documentary about national parks that provided beautiful scenery on their huge three-story screen. After the movie we checked out the 4D motion theater with its wind and water special effects. For lunch we ate in the cafeteria while looking out over the charter plaza. In the afternoon we visited the art studio where kids were doing craft projects. The body works area let us learn about human anatomy through models and interactives.

Diners looking for creative cooking will be sorely disappointed.Upon being seated, it took over fifteen minutes to receive drink orders.

The kitchen also struggled, as entrees took over an hour to be delivered to the table.Bland and overcooked describes most of the meals served. Even simple dishes like chicken tenders suffered from poor preparation. Sides were lackluster at best, unmemorable at worst. The sole bright spot was a seasonal salad, but it was not substantial enough to save the meal.At the prices they charge, patrons have every right to expect better quality food and service. But this restaurant offers neither, and comes across as uncaring about the dining experience. With so many delectable restaurants close by, there is little reason to waste time or money here. Save your appetite and dollars for one of the numerous superior options in this vibrant city center.In summary, this establishment provides mediocre fare amidst a wealth of excellent choices in uptown Charlotte.

Both appetizers were cooked to perfection, the chicken had a light and crispy exterior while the miso soup had a rich, balanced broth. For my main dish I got the wagyu beef bowl which came sizzling in a hot stone bowl. The tender cuts of wagyu along with the assortment of fresh vegetables were fantastic. The beef virtually melted in my mouth. I also got a side of steamed rice and picked out a bottle of craft beer from the selection. Everything was presented beautifully and the flavors truly shone through. Although it was a longer walk than I had planned, I'm glad I made the trip to discover this hidden gem.

Carowinds, in comparison, felt amateurish with its aging rides and tired theming. That said, I have to acknowledge that the parks in Orlando are on another level when it comes to budget. For being located in a much smaller city, Carowinds still manages to offer up a decent selection of rollercoasters and other rides to keep guests entertained for the day. While the theming leaves something to be desired, I appreciated some of the park's unique rides that I hadn't experienced elsewhere like the Flying Comets and Wooden Warrior. It was also fun to see elements of both the Carolinas represented throughout the park. The small town vibes of the boardwalk area provide a nice break from the busier sections of the park. That said, the park felt a bit tired and run-down in parts.Foot traffic was also noticeably lighter than what I'm used to at bigger name parks. This meant shorter lines which allowed us to experience more rides in a day. However, it also contributed to an emptier atmosphere that lackluster theming doesn't help. With some improvements and investments, I think Carowinds has potential to be a more polished regional park. As it stands now, Orlando veterans may find it underwhelming in comparison.

Performance areas were cleanly maintained with regulated occupancy to avoid overcrowding. Security was discreetly present yet clearly monitoring for any inappropriate conduct.Overall, it seemed to be operated as a professional adult venue.

Overall the Buckhead Saloon has kept much of its classic charm while slowly updating elements over the years. It remains a solid local dive bar and watering hole in the bustling Buckhead area. Unless they make drastic changes, it will maintain its role for many more years to come. The consistency and familiarity are part of its enduring appeal to locals and visitors alike.",

The receptionist was rude and dismissive when I checked in, making me wait much longer than my appointment time. Then during the exam, Dr. Atlas seemed annoyed and in a rush, hardly answering any of my questions. Afterward when I tried to schedule a follow up appointment, the receptionist accused me of being difficult and refusing to find a time that worked. I then asked to file a complaint about my experience and was told they don't accept complaints. On my way out I overheard the receptionist laughing about a previous \"difficult\" patient. I will never return to this office and do not recommend them to anyone due to the unacceptable level of disrespect shown to patients. It's clear to me they do not value people or their time. I hope others will see the numerous poor reviews and choose to seek eye care from a more professional practice.",

The restaurant delivers on both accounts by offering a plethora of classic Chinese dishes made fresh and served at reasonable price points. While the dining room is small and basic, it gets busy at meal times with patrons seeking an affordable bite. Menu standouts include the house lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, and beef and broccoli—all generous portions for the price. Customer favorites also consist of the steamed dumplings and house chow mein, though quality does vary slightly dish to dish. For a casual neighborhood eatery, Cherry House gets most recipes right and satisfies cravings without blowing the budget. However, those seeking premium or unusually-spiced Chinese cuisine would be better off exploring pricier options elsewhere. Atmosphere and service are simply no-frills; the focus is on getting food in and out quickly for dine-in or takeout. While not the most luxurious dining experience, Cherry House fulfills its function of budget-friendly Chinese without compromising too much on taste. It remains a reliable fallback during time crunches or when funds are tight. Overall, Cherry House delivers on the quick, inexpensive Chinese food it advertises, making it a worthy choice for the price. Just don't expect cutting-edge cuisine or lavish ambiance.",

This location has an energetic vibe perfect for catching games or hanging out with friends. The menu features delicious brick oven pizzas along with starters, salads, sandwiches and desserts that hit the spot. On game days the atmosphere is festive with fans cheering on their favorite teams. Whether dining in their spacious dining room or outside on the patio, the service is always friendly and attentive. As an added bonus they have a full bar serving craft beers, specialty cocktails and wines by the glass. The pizzas are made fresh daily with high quality ingredients - it's hard to go wrong with any selection. During halftime or time outs the lines can get long but they do a great job keeping wait times reasonable. My favorite is their Margherita pizza - the fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil shine through. They also have gluten-free and veggie options for those with dietary needs or preferences. For dessert their brownies and cookies satisfy any sweet tooth. On busier nights getting a table may require a wait but they offer bar seating and the chance to enjoy a drink while you watch the game. The outdoor space is dog friendly which is a plus. Prices are very fair for the quality and portion sizes you get. Whether you're downtown for business or fun, Brixx is always a reliable choice for good food and times with friends old and new. It's one of the signature places to visit when in uptown Charlotte. I leave full and satisfied each time I dine here. The staff works hard to ensure everyone has a great experience. This location is a go-to hangout any time of year. Brixx upholds consistently high standards in food, atmosphere and service - they have gained many loyal local fans.",

First stop was a trendy new cocktail bar downtown where we sampled innovative mixes and appetizers. The atmosphere was lively and the people-watching entertaining. From there we stumbled upon an underground jazz club oozing with character. We found a cozy corner table and lost track of time as legendary performers filled the room with soulful melodies. Feeling peckish after drinking and dancing the night away, we ventured to a late-night restaurant renowned for its comfort food. The menu did not disappoint with southern specialties that warmed our souls. Refueled, it was on to a buzzing nightclub where dancing and mingling stretched into the wee hours. Exhausted but satisfied, we reluctantly peeled away from the festivities as the sky began to brighten with the approaching sunrise. Returning to the penthouse was like stepping into an oasis of calm after the lively night outside. Waking late the next morning, we stretched out on the spacious balcony enjoying coffee with views of the sparkling ocean.

Checking out brought a tinge of sadness to leave the luxury retreat we had called home for a night in the vibrant city.

We had to ask for refills on our drinks multiple times since the server forgot about our table. The manager was conveniently missing whenever we tried to complain. After two hours of terrible service, we finally got our check which had mistakes and unauthorized charges. When we pointed out the issues to the server, he became rude and dismissive. We asked to speak to a manager who was also rude and unapologetic about the horrible experience. Other tables around us seemed to be having similar problems, waiting a long time for slow service. The restaurant was only half full so there was no reason for such slow service. The food itself was mediocre at best and not worth such a long wait. We will not be returning to this restaurant and will be sure to warn others about our experience. The staff and management need serious training in customer service and problem solving. I'm surprised this restaurant is still in business with the level of terrible service we received. No one else there seemed to care about addressing customers' problems and complaints in a timely manner. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice but that does not make up for the truly poor customer service from start to finish. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone and feel bad for others who may experience similar issues here. Management should make customer service and satisfaction a top priority instead of ignoring customer problems. There are too many other good local restaurants to spend our time and money at a place with service this unacceptable.

The first was Wilmington International Airport (ILM) in Wilmington, North Carolina. ILM is a medium hub airport that serves the Wilmington metro area with around 300 flights per week. The airport has two asphalt runways and one terminal building with 5 gates. Some of the airlines that fly into ILM include American, Delta, and United with service to hubs like Charlotte, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. Another airport was Florence Regional Airport (FLO) in Florence, South Carolina. FLO is a smaller airport that mainly handles regional flights on communities like American Eagle. The airport only has one runway and a modest terminal building. Other airports in the area like Myrtle Beach International and Raleigh-Durham International see much larger operations in comparison. Both ILM and FLO provide convenient air access for their local communities, though flights and destinations are more limited than at major hub airports.

It's clear that the kitchen takes pride in using fresh, high-quality ingredients. I look forward to returning for a regular dinner outside of restaurant week to experience more items on the menu. This place delivers consistently great food in a relaxed setting.",

The on hold music is terrible, it seems to be some kind of elevator-esque muzak playing on repeat every 3 minutes. I have counted that it takes exactly 143 seconds for the song to start over again. I am contemplating just hanging up at this point but I really need to get this issue resolved. I can't believe that with a major company like TWC it is this difficult just to speak to a actual person. The automated system never seems to understand what I say no matter how clearly I enunciate the options. This is beyond frustrating, aren't customer service and satisfaction supposed to be a priority for these types of companies? I'm sure I am not the only one with these terrible hold times and unhelpful automated systems. TWC must be losing customers left and right with this poor level of service, I know I will be looking to switch providers if I ever get off hold this time. My issue has now been ongoing for 3 days with no resolution in sight. At this point I am considering writing a sternly worded letter of complaint to TWC management to voice how unacceptable this customer experience has been. Enough is enough, I have spent over 2 hours on hold between these last two days trying to accomplish what should take 5 minutes tops with a live agent. I am guessing I will soon hit the 1 hour mark of wait time for this current call, at which point I think I will lose my patience and sanity. This review serves as a major warning for anyone considering TWC- look elsewhere or prepare for frustrations galore if you sign up with them. I can only hope that next time I call there is a miracle and I don't have to endure these long pointless holds. Ending on a hopeful note, fingers crossed the next agent can help me and end this nightmare customer service experience!",

With over 20 slides, a massive wave pool, and a lazy river circling the entire facility, thrill-seekers will be overwhelmed with options. My family spent the whole day taking turns riding the slides like the Corkscrew, which twists riders around before sending them down at high speeds. The wave pool is impressive for its size, with waves reaching several feet high every few minutes. We enjoyed relaxing on tubes along the lazy river, taking in beautiful views of the surrounding landscape as we gently floated along. All the slides have height restrictions to ensure safety, but even younger visitors can join in the fun at slides like the Tadpole which is a simple straight slide great for beginners. The water park also has a large sandy beach entry area perfect for relaxing in the sun or playing beach games like volleyball. During lunch one day we ate at the full service restaurant right in the water park, which conveniently let us eat together as a group. The food and service were both good though a bit overpriced as is typical for a theme park location. Staff is very attentive, with plenty of lifeguards on duty to monitor guests in the pools and slides. The water temperature was always comfortable, neither too cold nor too hot. On busier days, expect longer lines for the most popular slides, but there are usually alternate slides and attractions with little to no wait. Overall the water park provided a full day's worth of exciting activities for all ages. While expensive for admission, it's undoubtedly the best part of staying at this resort. The water park keeps families entertained for hours on end, making it a real highlight for families seeking a memorable summer getaway.",

The menu had a good variety of appetizers, sandwiches, and entrees to choose from. I opted for the chicken quesadillas which were tasty but a bit small for the price. My colleagues both ordered burgers which they said were cooked well but nothing special. The bartender made our drinks competently but didn't seem very engaged.

Both dishes looked beautifully plated and very appetizing. My partner cut into one of the plump scallops and was amazed by the creamy texture inside. He enjoyed the scallops so much that he asked for my opinion on them. I agreed that they were cooked to perfection. We also took turns sampling each other's dishes, and both were delicious. It was difficult to leave any food uneaten on our plates. We lingered over dinner, chatting and savoring our meals. For dessert, we shared a portion of the chocolate mousse.

When I arrived during the busy lunch rush, the employees handling orders and food preparation seemed stressed but remained polite and efficient. My order was ready surprisingly fast considering how packed it was. The fries were hot and crispy, just the way I like them. My burger patty looked freshly grilled and was juicy inside. The special sauce and toppings were applied neatly. The dining area was clean and tidy, with garbage emptied regularly. I even noticed an employee busing empty tables between serving customers. The bathrooms were also spotlessly clean. Overall I found the quality and freshness of ingredients to be on par or better than other McDonald's I've been to. I'll definitely be back to this location again. For a fast food restaurant pumping out orders non-stop, I was impressed with the effort put into customer service and cleanliness here.

The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is a surprisingly scenic and enjoyable airport experience. There is plenty of natural light pouring through the large windows that line the concourses. Trees and plants are placed throughout to make the interior feel almost park-like at times. The art program has commissioned many local Pacific Northwest artists to display their works, providing colorful insights into the region. Good local coffee and snack options abound to keep hungry and weary travelers satisfied. Even the walk between terminals is pleasant, following an underground walkway with more natural elements incorporated into the design. Signage is clear and intuitive to help passengers find their ways. Security lines usually move quickly thanks to the many checkpoints that are often open. Once airside, it's fun to people watch from the windows facing the tarmac and see all the different planes on the taxiways and runways. On nice days, the majestic Mt. Rainier is often visible on the horizon as a beautiful backdrop. I've never had a truly bad travel experience departing or connecting through Seattle-Tacoma Airport. It's easy to see why it has consistently ranked high in customer satisfaction and quality surveys for mid-sized airports. Even the smaller regional carriers have amenities like power outlets at each seat. The airport does a great job feeling comfortable without losing its functional, efficient purpose. Overall, Sea-Tac provides a delightfully stress-free experience compared to other major hubs around the country.",

It has been years since Charlotte last had an NBA team, making the Hornets return very exciting for basketball fans in the Carolinas. The new Hornets showcase an energetic young roster including Kemba Walker and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist that are fun to watch. While it may take some time for this new team to become a playoff contender, they play with grit and have shown flashes of brilliance against top opponents. The Buzz City faithful have really embraced their team again and turned Games Nights into electric atmospheres at the Time Warner Cable Arena. It will be interesting to see how high-scoring guard Kemba Walker leads his teammates and progresses in his role as the team's star player. This season represents a new beginning for basketball in Charlotte as a new generation of fans get behind their Hornets. If the young core continues to develop together, the future looks bright for this franchise to once again compete for championships. For now, fans are simply enjoying having NBA games and the Hornets tradition back in the Queen City. This rebirth of Hornets basketball in Charlotte has breathed new life into the city.",

Finding your way through the large busy halls to your gate isn't always easy either. It also takes quite a while to get through security screenings at peak times. The restaurants and shops seem to always be packed as well. It wasn't uncommon on my last visit to have to wait in long lines. There never seems to be enough seats available either so you often end up standing around. Despite the busyness, the staff usually do a great job of getting people where they need to go. For the most part things ran pretty smoothly on my trips here. While a busy airport isn't always ideal, it does say something positive about the airport's popularity and usage. The number of flights and travelers also means this airport serves as a major transportation hub. When it's time to head home it's also reassuring to know you have lots of flight options. Although crowded, the variety of dining and retail options does help pass the time. It was interesting people watching the mix of travelers passing through. My one complaint would be that WiFi can get bogged down at times due to high traffic. It would be nice if they added more charging stations too. Still, overall this airport gets you where you need to go reliably even if it's not always the most relaxing experience.

Upgrades and new installations also take forever to complete, leaving customers without service for weeks at a time. Even routine maintenance often disrupts service for hours or days without warning. The speeds we pay for are rarely actually delivered, especially during peak hours. Outages are also far too common, whether planned or unplanned. Their website and billing are an endless source of confusion and frustration as well. It's nearly impossible to get an accurate bill or make meaningful changes to your account online. Their rates also increase annually at an unjustifiable rate but we have no other real options for service in our area. At this point, I think anything would be better than Time Warner Cable. If another provider offered service here I would switch immediately, no matter the cost, just to get away from the poor service and outdated equipment. Time Warner Cable may have once been a leader in the industry but they have clearly fallen very far behind.

I'll gladly pay the small fee OT charges per reservation since it saves me so much time and hassle compared to calling restaurants directly. Recently I even used OT while traveling out of town to find a spot for dinner on short notice - it worked just as smoothly in another city. The ability to add diners and make last minute changes from the app is also extremely convenient. I'm signed up for notification emails that alert me to newly available times, which has allowed me to snag hard-to-get reservations before they disappear. All my dining companions are now using OT as well since they've seen first hand how seamless the process is when reserving through the app. It's nice to not have to stress over logistics and just concentrate on enjoying a good meal with friends and family. OT has truly changed the way I experience restaurants by taking away all the usual irritation of securing a reservation.

She seemed put off, and her attitude towards me became noticeably cooler.I was seated at a small table near the back of the restaurant, and as I glanced around, I noticed that the other patrons were all couples or groups. It seemed that solo diners like myself were not welcome.The menu was impressive, with a wide selection of dishes that catered to various dietary preferences. However, the options were overwhelming, and I found it difficult to choose just one entree.I ordered the grilled salmon, which arrived lacking the generous portion size that I had been expecting. The fish was cooked to perfection, but it was served with a measly side of vegetables that left me feeling unsatisfied.The waiter, who had been friendly at the beginning of my meal, became increasingly aloof as he realized that I was not going to order additional dishes or drinks. He stopped by rarely, and when he did, he seemed annoyed that I was still lingering at my table.I finished my meal and prepared to leave, but as I reached for my credit card to pay, I noticed that there was a mandatory 18% service charge added to my bill. This seemed excessive, especially considering the subpar service that I had received.I decided to speak with the manager to express my dissatisfaction, but after waiting for 15 minutes, I gave up and left the restaurant. My experience at this establishment was disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Despite the positive reviews, I found the atmosphere and service to be uninviting and overpriced.",

I squeezed a bit of lime over the meat, and the burst of citrus flavor complemented the rich, savory steak beautifully.

It was cooked to a perfect juiciness, with just a hint of smokiness from the grill. The shrimp were paired with a tangy, slightly spicy sauce that left me wanting more. Before I knew it, I had polished off both tacos and was eyeing the dessert menu.The Churros caught my eye, and I couldn't resist ordering a plate.

I was torn between the grilled salmon and the vegetarian pasta, but ultimately decided on the latter.My pasta dish arrived promptly, and I was immediately struck by the vibrant colors and generous portion size. The flavors were bold and well-balanced, with a perfect blend of herbs and spices. The fresh vegetables were cooked to perfection, and I appreciated the attention to detail in each bite.Throughout my meal, the service was attentive and friendly, with neither too much nor too little attention from the staff. When I needed a refill on my wine, it was promptly delivered, and the check was presented at just the right time.The total cost of my meal, including the Groupon and a generous tip, came to around $40.

The flavors were unbalanced, with too much emphasis on the bitter notes, which overpowered the subtle sweetness of the rhubarb. The drink was also over-iced, which made it watery and diluted the flavors even further.The Potstickers were a better start to the meal, with a crispy exterior and a flavorful filling. However, they were served with a poorly made dipping sauce that lacked depth and richness.The Lettuce Wraps were a refreshing change of pace, with crisp lettuce leaves filled with savory ingredients. However, the portion size was small, and the wraps were overpriced at $12.The Dolsot Bi Bim Bap was the highlight of the meal, with a rich, flavorful sauce and a generous serving of nutritious ingredients. Unfortunately, the bibimbap was served with a side of bland white rice, which detracted from the overall experience.The Vietnamese Beef Noodles were a disappointment, with overcooked noodles and a lackluster broth.

Could I really provide a fair and informative review of something so advanced?But I'm always up for a challenge, so I decided to give it a shot. And let me tell you, this AI assistant is something else. It's like having a personal assistant who's always at your beck and call, ready to answer any question or perform any task you throw at it. And the best part? It's incredibly easy to use, even for a techno-phobe like me.I started off by asking it some basic questions, like the weather and the time. And to my surprise, it answered correctly and quickly, without any hesitation. I then moved on to some more complex tasks, like setting reminders and sending emails. Again, the AI assistant performed flawlessly, never once faltering or making a mistake.One of the things that really impressed me was its ability to understand natural language. I could ask it questions in my own words, using colloquial expressions and idioms, and it would still understand what I was asking. It was almost like talking to a real person, except that this AI assistant was always available and never got tired or grumpy.Another feature that I found particularly useful was its ability to learn and adapt. Over time, it began to recognize my habits and preferences, and would offer suggestions and recommendations based on that information. It was like having my own personal assistant, tailored specifically to my needs and preferences.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning a few drawbacks.

The exterior looks a bit worn down, and the interior could use a refresh. The menu has a lot of options, but the food didn't impress me. I ordered the burger and it was overcooked, the fries were soggy, and the salad was bland. The service was friendly but not attentive, I had to ask multiple times for a refill on my drink. Overall, it's not a great value for the price. I'd recommend driving a bit further to go to a different diner.",

The food is consistently delicious and the service is friendly.However, my most recent visit was a bit disappointing. The egg rolls were not as crispy as usual, and the lo mein was a bit overcooked.I've also noticed that the portions have been getting smaller over time. I remember when the egg rolls were huge and filled with plenty of vegetables and meat. Now, they're smaller and have less filling.The soup is still good, though. I always get the hot and sour soup, and it's always flavorful and satisfying.The atmosphere is also nice. The decor is traditional Chinese and the lighting is dim, which creates a cozy atmosphere.The prices are reasonable, too. I've never felt like I've overpaid for my meal.Despite the small issues, I would still recommend China Palace to my friends and family. It's a reliable choice for good Chinese food.The wait staff is also friendly and attentive. They're always quick to refill my water glass and check in to make sure everything is to my liking.One thing that's a bit annoying is that they don't take credit cards. I always have to make a trip to the ATM before I come here.Overall, I would say that China Palace is a good choice if you're looking for a quick and satisfying Chinese meal. Just be prepared for smaller portions and no credit cards.",

However, the quality of the pastries is inconsistent, with some being overly sweet and others lacking flavor. The croissants are a highlight, flaky and buttery with a perfect balance of flavors. The cakes are visually appealing, but the frosting can be overly sweet and overpowering. The bakery's coffee is average, nothing special but pairs well with the baked goods. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with comfortable seating and a friendly staff. Prices are reasonable, falling in line with other bakeries in the area. Overall, Paddy cake bakery is a good option for those seeking a casual bakery experience, but not the best choice for those looking for high-quality pastries.",

It's easy to feel suffocated by the concrete jungle, and I find that a dose of fresh air and greenery can do wonders for my mental health. I recently discovered a hidden gem of a park located just a short drive from the city center. It's a tranquil oasis that's perfect for a picnic or a leisurely stroll. The park is surrounded by towering trees that block out most of the city noise, and the grounds are carefully maintained, with lush grass and colorful flowers blooming throughout the year. There's even a small pond where you can feed the ducks or take a boat ride. It's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful retreat.",

You'll find a large warehouse-style store with a wide selection of bulk items, groceries, and electronics. The prices are generally competitive with other warehouse clubs, and they often have sales and promotions.One difference I've noticed between BJ's and Sam's Club is the layout of the store. BJ's seems to have a more organized and easier-to-navigate layout, with clear signs and a logical flow to the aisles. Sam's Club, on the other hand, can feel a bit more cluttered and overwhelming.Another advantage of BJ's is their membership benefits. They offer a variety of membership levels, including a basic membership for individuals and families, as well as a business membership for small business owners. These memberships come with perks like discounts on certain items, free shipping on online orders, and special promotions.One thing to keep in mind when shopping at BJ's is that they have a minimum purchase requirement for some items. This can be a bit frustrating if you're only looking to buy a few things, but it's worth it if you're planning to buy in bulk.Overall, I'd recommend BJ's to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to buy bulk items and groceries. They offer a wide selection, competitive prices, and valuable membership benefits. Just be prepared for a busy and sometimes overwhelming shopping experience, especially on weekends.",
