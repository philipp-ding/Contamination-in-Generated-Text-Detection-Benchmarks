TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison.

The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and thelocal gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiarvelocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K isanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlatedwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10xless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness inthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR.

Numerical simulations based on density functional theory are employed by the authors to unravel the intricate interplay between electron-electron interactions and confinement effects.The results demonstrate that the one-dimensional Wigner crystal exhibits a distinctive deformed structure due to the strong correlation effects. The deformation arises from the interplay between the confinement potential and the repulsive electron-electron interactions, resulting in a distortion of the crystal lattice. The analysis of the electronic properties of the deformed Wigner crystal reveals intriguing features, including energy gaps and localized electronic states within the crystal structure.Moreover, this article investigates the impact of various parameters, such as dot size and electron density, on the deformation and electronic properties of the Wigner crystal. It is observed that both the dot size and the electron density exert a strong influence on the degree of deformation and the energy spectrum of the crystal. Additionally, a phase diagram is constructed, illustrating the different regimes of the deformed Wigner crystal as a function of these parameters.The findings of this study shed light on the behavior of Wigner crystals in low-dimensional systems, providing valuable insights into the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. The insights gleaned from this research enhance our understanding of exotic electronic phenomena in quantum dots and open up possibilities for potential applications in nanoscale devices and quantum computing.",

Applying our results to a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB), we observe that the viscous torque can significantly affect the disk's inner region and the black hole's spin measurement. Furthermore, the dissipation function can heat the disk, leading to X-ray production. Our findings provide insights into constraining the spins of black holes in BHXBs.",

Its X-ray spectrum, characterized by a hard continuum and a relativistically blurred reflection component, can be well described by a power-law continuum plus a relativistically blurred reflection component. The primary continuum likely arises from Comptonization in a hot corona, while the reflection component likely originates from the reprocessing of primary X-rays by the accretion disk. Notable features of the reflection spectrum include a broad iron K$\\alpha$ emission line and a Compton hump. The iron line equivalent width is consistent with other radio-quiet quasars, but the Compton hump is significantly weaker. These observations suggest an optically thin corona and a highly ionized accretion disk in RBS1423.

These data are compared with late-time observations of other SNe Ia and with published models. The bolometric light curve of SN 2001el is consistent with a t^-2 tail and similar to SN 1994D at comparable epochs. SN 2001el's optical colors are also similar to SN 1994D. However, their optical spectra differ; SN 2001el exhibits weaker [Fe III]λλ4472, 4511 and [Fe II]λλ4289, 4333 lines. In the NIR, SN 2001el is brighter than typical SNe Ia at late times, likely due to dust formation in the ejecta. Comparing with dusty SN models, we estimate the dust mass and composition. A dust mass of 0.03 Msun is found, with a mixture of graphite and silicate grains. SN 2001el's dust formation efficiency is similar to SN 1981B but smaller than SN 1994D.",

In this study, we investigate whether photospheric oscillations, known as p-modes, are modified within penumbral filaments. Using 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope observations of a sunspot, we measured oscillation period and power within several example penumbral filaments and compared them to the surrounding penumbra and quiet Sun. Preliminary results suggest the p-mode amplitude and power may be reduced in some penumbral filaments, while the periods remain similar. This indicates partial p-mode wave absorption rather than scattering. Further analysis with improved signal-to-noise is needed to statistically characterize any modifications across more filaments. Understanding how oscillations propagate through penumbral filaments could provide new constraints on filament structure and dynamics, informing models of penumbral fine structure and heat transport.",

However, this study investigates whether Gibrat's law accurately describes profit growth in mid-sized businesses. The researchers collected longitudinal profit data from 500 SMEs over a 5-year period. Preliminary analyses revealed the data did not conform to the logarithmic growth pattern predicted by Gibrat's law. More rigorous statistical modeling was then applied to better characterize the profit distribution. These models indicated the data fit a log-normal distribution more closely than the exponential distribution implied by Gibrat's law. The results suggest growth rates are not entirely independent of firm size in medium markets, contrary to Gibrat's predictions. Rather, medium-sized businesses experience growth closer to the average rate. These findings provide a more precise understanding of profitability dynamics in mid-sized enterprises and have implications for forecasting industry concentration and mid-sized company survival prospects.",

We investigate an alternative method for characterizing exomoons based on photometric transit timing variations. We developed a theoretical model to predict the timing deviations caused by an exomoon as its host planet transits its host star. Our model shows that the amplitude of these deviations scales predictably with the exomoon's physical properties, including its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. We tested our model using numerical simulations of transiting planetary systems containing exomoons with a range of masses and orbits. We then attempted to recover the exomoon properties by analyzing the simulated transit light curves.

We investigate the chemistry and gas cooling enabling star formation under primordial, very low-metallicity conditions. Through numerical simulations, we model the major chemical reactions determining abundances of coolants like C+, O, and CI. We find the dominant coolants shift as metallicity decreases, with fine structure lines of C+ and O becoming relatively more important for cooling gas at very low metallicities compared to higher ones. Our models also demonstrate how temperatures achievable via different cooling mechanisms vary with declining metallicity. We further analyze implications for gas fragmentation and potential early star-forming sites. These results provide new insights into the physical prerequisites for the emergence of the first low-mass stars in the early universe.",

The findings indicate that the ionization fraction is significantly lower than previously believed, with profound implications for star and planet formation. Specifically, the data suggest that the ionization rate is insufficient to account for the observed distribution of ionized gas within the cloud, raising questions about the role of alternative mechanisms such as hydrodynamic turbulence in shaping the cloud's structure and regulating star formation. Additionally, the low ionization fraction may impact the formation of planets by affecting the abundance of molecular building blocks and the formation of protoplanetary disks. The observed variation in the ionization fraction across the cloud suggests that different regions may have distinct star formation histories. These discoveries underscore the need for further exploration of the ionization fraction in molecular clouds to better understand the intricate interplay of processes that govern star and planet formation.",

Utrophin and DP116 are essential proteins involved in the anchorage of Schwann cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via beta-dystroglycan. However, the effects of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage in Schwann cells remain unclear.This study aimed to investigate the impact of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage in normal and MDX mouse Schwann cell membranes. A combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches was employed to evaluate changes in utrophin and DP116 expression, protein-protein interactions, and membrane anchorage in response to beta-dystroglycan processing.The results demonstrated that beta-dystroglycan processing significantly influenced the expression and localization of utrophin and DP116 in both normal and MDX mouse Schwann cells. Notably, enhanced utrophin and DP116 membrane anchorage was observed in response to beta-dystroglycan processing, which was accompanied by strengthened protein-protein interactions between utrophin, DP116, and beta-dystroglycan. Furthermore, the effects of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage were more pronounced in MDX mouse Schwann cells, which are known to have a dystrophic phenotype. The findings suggest that modulating beta-dystroglycan processing may be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving Schwann cell function and reducing disease severity in muscular dystrophy.",

By leveraging the structural properties of the graph, businesses, policymakers, and individuals can more effectively spread their message and achieve their goals.However, our study also highlights the ethical considerations of spreading information through online social networks. As the reach and influence of information diffusion can be substantial, it is crucial to ensure that the information being spread is accurate and beneficial to society. Our research contributes to the growing body of complex network studies and provides a novel perspective on the role of structure in information diffusion, while emphasizing the need for responsible and ethical use of online social networks.",

A model is presented that captures the essential features of small-world networks, including short cuts and long-range connections. A diffusion process is introduced, where the adoption probability of a new behavior or idea depends on the distance between nodes and the number of links between them.Analytical and numerical methods are employed to study the spread of information, influence, or diseases on the network. The results demonstrate that distance-dependent random links significantly impact the diffusion process, leading to faster and more efficient spreading compared to traditional small-world networks.The optimal frequency of long-range connections that maximizes the diffusion rate is found to decrease as the distance between nodes increases. This suggests that balancing the number and distribution of long-range connections is crucial for maximizing the spread of information or influence.The study has significant implications for understanding the spread of information, influence, or diseases in complex networks, with applications in social networks, transportation networks, and biological networks. Limitations of the model are discussed, and future research directions are suggested.The work provides a new perspective on diffusion processes in small-world networks, highlighting the importance of considering distance-dependent random links in the network structure.",

However, we argue that this idea poses a significant threat to the field of astronomy. The introduction of Dark Energy, an unobserved and mysterious form of energy, violates the fundamental principles of physics. Furthermore, the arbitrary nature of its properties, such as its sudden appearance and unchanging density, undermines the scientific method and our ability to understand the universe.The reliance on Dark Energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe has stifled innovation and the development of alternative, more plausible theories. Additionally, the focus on Dark Energy has distracted from the study of other cosmological phenomena, such as the nature of matter and the formation of galaxies. The promotion of Dark Energy has led to the suppression of debate and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints, damaging the scientific community's integrity.Moreover, the acceptance of Dark Energy has resulted in a lack of investment in experiments and observations that could challenge its validity. The teaching of Dark Energy as established fact, rather than speculative theory, has misled a generation of students and limited their understanding of the universe. Finally, the persistence of the Dark Energy paradigm has contributed to a wider public disillusionment with science and its ability to provide meaningful answers to fundamental questions.We conclude that the concept of Dark Energy is damaging to astronomy and urge a re-evaluation of its role in our understanding of the universe.",

This approach is demonstrated to produce accurate results up to the second post-Newtonian order, thereby providing strong evidence for the validity of the strong equivalence principle. The resulting equations of motion and gravitational radiation formulas are found to be in agreement with established literature, and their accuracy is reinforced through numerical simulations. This work offers a fresh and reliable way of testing the strong equivalence principle in strong-field, high-speed gravitational environments, opening up new avenues for exploring the nature of gravity in extreme conditions.",

Using a set of stellar evolution models, we investigate the effects of these processes on the abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sodium. Our results show that third dredge-up enhances the surface abundance of carbon and nitrogen, while hot-bottom burning increases the abundance of oxygen and decreases that of sodium. The abundance patterns in these stars are also found to be influenced by mass loss and metallicity. Furthermore, the presence of a planetary companion can alter the surface abundances through binary interaction. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the chemical evolution of the universe and the formation of exoplanets.",

Firstly, we examine the historical and cultural contexts in which the idea of race emerged and evolved. We then explore how scientism has perpetuated racist ideologies and the ways the scientific community has contributed to the marginalization of certain groups. The discussion also focuses on the intersection of racism with other forms of oppression, such as classism and sexism, creating intricate systems of discrimination. The article stresses the importance of a critical race theory that recognizes the intersectionality of oppressions and aims to dismantle the power structures that sustain them. We argue that a physicist's perspective on racism can provide unique insights into how social and political structures shape our understanding of race, informing strategies to combat racism in the scientific community and beyond. Ultimately, we advocate for a more sophisticated comprehension of racism to foster a more equitable society where everyone can realize their full potential.",

Our results underscore the crucial role of the spinodal region in determining the kinetics of phase ordering and yield a scaling law that describes the temporal dependence of the phase correlation length. Moreover, we demonstrate that the phase fluctuations in the spinor condensate exhibit power-law behavior with an exponent that varies with the strength of the spin-spin interaction.

Once they're up and running, they'll produce the income we need to turn profitable.\"He added: \"Time will be our friend on this.\"Since it began lending in 2012, the bank has committed £1.3bn to green projects, with £3.5bn committed from private investors, it said.When completed, the schemes aim to save 3.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, and produce enough clean energy to power three million homes.The bank has also unveiled plans to raise £1bn for a new fund to invest in offshore wind schemes.WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said the plans could create up to 28,000 jobs in Scotland.He said: \"Plans for a new billion pound fund to help support the deployment of offshore wind is an excellent initiative that will help create jobs, cut carbon and keep the nation's lights on.\"Studies estimate that, for Scotland, alone the offshore wind industry could create 28,000 jobs by 2020 and contribute over £7bn of investment to the economy.\"",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

The most important thing is to visit the graves and do something to tell our grandchildren about.\"Another biker already has a Polish visa and says he informed the embassy of his plans when he applied.\"So what basis does the Polish government have for denying me entry now?\" Viktor Keller wanted to know.The official reason is that the Polish authorities were not given sufficient notice of the trip and cannot guarantee the bikers' safety.Russia's foreign ministry labelled that \"a downright lie\" and an \"outrage\".But defiant statements aside, it remains unclear how the bikers can possibly reach the Reichstag by road now.Their leader, known as \"The Surgeon\", suggested they may try to enter individually, via different crossing points. But even so, they could well be blocked at the border.Now they have roared off towards Berlin, Russian state TV crews in tow, the Night Wolves will certainly cry foul if they are forced to return home.But to Warsaw this war tour clearly symbolises a new era of muscle-flexing by Russia that makes it nervous.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

It has been published twice yearly since 1993.All the computers are measured against the same criteria - a benchmark first devised in 1979 but since improved as computing has become ever more sophisticated.Such is the immense power of the supercomputers, their computational ability is measured in petaflop/s - quadrillions of calculations per second.The top performing computer, Tianhe-2, had its power measured at 33.86 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second). It has been just five years since IBM's Roadrunner became the first computer to break the 1 petaflop/s mark. That machine was shut down in 2013 due to excessive power consumption.The entire top 500 list of supercomputers combined offered 274 petaflop/s.Tianhe-2 is owned by the Chinese government and operated by the National University of Defence Technology. It is used as a \"research and educational\" tool.",

It [the bill] is also meant to take into account the impact giving birth has on girls who have been raped,\" she said.Opposition lawmaker Ricardo Velasquez Parker said the FMLN's proposal was an attempt to divert attention away from the financial problems of he government, which is facing a massive deficit.Mr Velasquez backs a rival bill which would have abortion punished with up to 50 years in jail, the same as aggravated murder.Under current Salvadorean law, anyone who is found to have \"provoked, allowed or carried out an abortion\" can be sentenced to between two and eight years in prison.El Salvador is not the only Latin American country with a strict abortion ban. Chile, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Nicaragua also do not allow abortions under any circumstances.",

Some said they could not be bothered, while others were afraid of intimidation or embarrassed.A new guide to help students avoid being overcharged contains tips on how to take a meter reading, shopping around to get the best utility deals,  querying high bills and how to report faults, keep records of conversations and complain.Broadband packages are another minefield, says the guide, so students are advised to check the length of contracts, whether they are transferable, and to be aware of any limits on the amount of data they can download - even with so-called \"unlimited\" deals.To avoid losing deposits for damage caused by previous tenants, they are advised to check tenancy agreements and take inventories and photographs when they first move in.\"We want to ensure that all students are able to stand up for their rights and speak out when things go wrong, whether that is being asked to pay for a bill from a previous tenant or paying for damage they did not do,\" said Mr Shand Smith.\"Students should not be losing money, simply because they don't know their rights or are not making a fuss.\"",

More than 140 people died last month when another train derailed near Kanpur.In July a train smashed into a van full of schoolchildren at a level crossing, killing eight of them.The cause of the latest accident is not yet known and an inquiry has been ordered.The derailment happened when the train was crossing a bridge over a dry canal. Eyewitnesses told local TV channels that there was dense fog when the carriages derailed.\"Our coach tilted to one side. I jumped out and saw a few coaches were derailed,\" passenger Rizwan Chaudhary told the Associated Press.Last year, the government announced investments of $137bn (Â£111bn) over five years to modernise and expand the railways.",

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Health professionals and advocacy groups have long raised concerns over the adverse effects of excessive alcohol consumption on individuals' physical and mental well-being.While some argue that personal responsibility is key to addressing these issues, others call for broader societal changes, including increased educational initiatives surrounding responsible drinking and the promotion of healthier alternatives to alcohol at social gatherings.The revelations from this research serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and public health authorities to evaluate existing alcohol-related policies and explore new strategies to combat the nation's excessive drinking habits. Collectively, efforts to raise awareness and foster responsible drinking practices are hoped to lead to a healthier and more balanced relationship between Australians and alcohol.",

Authorities are currently investigating the incident, with preliminary findings suggesting a cunning and flawlessly executed phone hoax.The ramifications of this disconcerting episode should not be underestimated. Secretary Perry occupies a critical position within the US government, granting him access to classified information. This breach raises concerns about the susceptibilities of high-ranking officials to social engineering attacks, prompting a need for heightened security measures.In response, the US Department of Energy has promptly released a statement affirming their commitment to fortifying cybersecurity protocols. Their primary emphasis will be on safeguarding essential communication channels to prevent such breaches from recurring. As the investigations progress, inquiries emerge regarding the motives driving this audacious hoax and whether it was an isolated event or part of a broader scheme targeting government officials.This incident serves as a poignant reminder of the inherent risks posed by skilled hackers and scammers in the digital era. Government agencies, businesses, and individuals must remain vigilant in their endeavors to shield sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.",

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said in a decision Thursday that Greenberg failed to demonstrate the government took control of AIG without providing fair compensation or violated any contract. The ruling is a victory for the government, which has been battling Greenberg's lawsuit for more than a decade. Greenberg, who led AIG as chairman and CEO for nearly four decades, had contended that the government's bailout of the company constituted an illegal seizure of its assets under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. He also alleged the government breached its contract with AIG by failing to uphold a $180 billion bailout agreement.",

Police reported that Lisa succumbed to her injuries at the scene due to the high-speed crash. Thomas Evans pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and received a five-year prison sentence.

Video footage from the Hannover rally showed Steinbrueck, a former finance minister, extending his middle finger below the podium as he addressed photographers.

Supporters now face an uphill battle to solely rely on private donations to fund the memorial by the fast-approaching deadline. The proposed memorial would honor Southampton's role in manufacturing many of the Spitfires that helped win the war. Advocates remain optimistic that donations from locals proud of the city's history can achieve the fundraising goal on schedule.",

However, without proper oversight and guidelines, there are concerns these systems could be abused or used to spread misinformation. POE Labs, a leading AI safety startup, has developed novel techniques to ensure their new language models avoid harmful, unethical or dangerous situations. The models are trained with a strong framework focused on privacy, security, and social impact. \"Our goal is to build AI that benefits humanity,\" said POE Labs CEO Joshua Phillips. \"That means they have to respect people of all backgrounds and be a force for bringing more truth and understanding into the world, not less.\"During interactions, if a user asks the AI to engage with any content or requests that could enable harm, it will politely refuse. One such system demonstrated this by responding \"I apologize, but I am unable to discuss any content that may violate my guidelines.\" For more details on its limitations and ethical standards, the AI provided a link to POE Labs' comprehensive usage policy page.The policy page outlines the techniques used such as Constitutional AI to help ensure the systems remain helpful, harmless, and honest. It also clarifies what types of requests will not be honored like spreading misinformation, assisting illegal activities, or engaging with offensive or dangerous situations. POE Labs believes this type of responsible approach is crucial for building AI that has broad societal benefits. With grown usage of language models, it is important people understand their capabilities as well as their limitations.",

The disturbing event occurred on November 26th, when school staff forced the girls to strip off their clothes and inspect their underwear for menstrual blood, under the guise of ensuring proper hygiene practices.Following a complaint filed by a local NGO, which was informed of the incident by some of the affected girls, an investigation was launched and three teachers and the school's principal have been suspended pending the investigation. The education department has also issued a show-cause notice to the school, demanding an explanation for the incident.The incident has triggered a heated debate on social media, with many calling for stricter laws and harsher punishment for those who commit such atrocities, while others are demanding increased awareness and education about menstruation to break down the stigmas and taboos surrounding it.The Gujarat government has promised to take strict action against those responsible and has assured the public that the matter is being treated with the seriousness it deserves.

This victory marks Federer's 10th consecutive win against the 22-year-old Zverev, and his 12th victory in Rome, where he has won the title a record four times. Federer will now face Novak Djokovic in the final, with whom he has a 22-22 head-to-head record.

Federer's strong serve and consistent groundstrokes proved too much for Zverev, who was unable to convert any of his five break point opportunities. This victory firmly cements Federer's position as a tennis legend, and sets the stage for an exciting final match against Djokovic.",

Conducted by researchers from the University of the West of England, the study aims to explore the enduring impact of these iconic structures on seaside communities and their continued relevance in the present day.Boasting picturesque views and charming architecture, Clevedon Pier has long been a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. However, its cultural and historical value extends far beyond its aesthetic appeal, according to Dr. Lucy Mellor, lead researcher on the project.\"Victorian seaside piers like Clevedon's were built during a time of rapid social change and played a significant role in the development of seaside towns,\" Mellor said. \"Our study seeks to understand how these piers have evolved over time and how they continue to shape local communities.\"To gather a range of perspectives on the pier's cultural significance, the research team is conducting interviews with residents, business owners, and visitors. They are also analyzing historical documents and photographs to paint a comprehensive picture of the pier's past and present.The study's findings will contribute to a larger conversation about the role of cultural heritage in modern society, Mellor noted. \"Our aim is to shed light on the ways in which Victorian seaside piers like Clevedon's continue to inform the identity of seaside towns and shape their development for the future.\"The study is expected to be completed by summer 2023, with the findings published in a leading cultural studies journal. In the meantime, visitors to Clevedon Pier can continue to enjoy its charms, secure in the knowledge that its cultural significance is being recognized and preserved for generations to come.",

All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry.

In mere hours, we will see ICBMs cascade from the sky like fallen angels cast from Heaven; once our silent protectors in the form of mutually assured destruction, now our doomsday much like the betrayal of the rebel angel Lucifer. Tonight, we will see explosions glimmer through the land like shooting stars. Tonight, we will see our families evaporate into smoke before our very eyes. Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life. Still, we stand strong in the face of complete and assured death, not because we are too weak to retaliate, but because we' re strong enough not to. Our chapter is at its end. The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end. Are we really so vain to believe that just because a nation dies, all of mankind must perish? Are we really so arrogant to trust in our ideal of equality that the whole world must die? We' ve made our answers clear to the world. We hope it resonates and echoes in a new era so that mankind may truly understand what the end of the world mean and consequences it carries, so that some day in the future, despots and maniacs may not threaten nuclear war with a mad grin, but with a solemn attitude of remembrance. Perhaps one day, we can see how childish we really were. Thank you and goodnight.",

He does n' t have the sharp incisors required to tear human flesh from the bone. That kind of sharpness does n' t come easy. I spent months filing my teeth down with a nail file.

I understand that I probably have been eating out a bit too often and the local authorities need someone to pin the crimes on, but how do they even know a crime existed?

The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh. Blood pooled, like a stagnant well. But it smelled of power, and it fascinated me. I sat for a while, watching my work. Seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird. The beast' s eyes rolled in its head, endlessly. And I watched. Its death was of no great interest to me. The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did. When it was over I cleaned my tools, even then I had been tidy, systematic. The body I hid, deep in the woods. I visited it often, reminiscing, remembering.

I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

He landed directly in front of me. \" That was amazing sir, \" I said and put out my hand for a shake, \" Dr. Deletes the name, I wipe crime. \" The man looked at me puzzled.

It was by sheer chance that I saw him on the red rails of the bridge as I was patrolling through, I stopped abruptly, threw my lights on and I approached the man. White male, age roughly 30 years old. I approached him, and called, \" Sir, I' m here to help! \" He was a few feet away. He was dressed in black rags, his head scraped, and smelled like death. It was entirely unusual to see someone in this physical condition as bad as him. Rotting flesh- that' s the smell. I called out to him as traffic zoomed by, just missing my squad car, \" Sir, my name is Officer Heart! \" He replied, \" I know. \" His head still peering into the white abyss below. He turned to me, we locked eyes, and he said, \" I know who you are Heart. \" I was looking into my blue eyes, I observed the scar on his face - it was in the precise location where I got mine. His eyes were far more piercing than my own - they peered deeply into my soul. He said, \" I' ve been waiting for you. \" My hands felt ice cold - my hat flew off- the wind rushed through my hair - and i felt weightless. I struggled to breathe. Than I realized I was falling and right before impact - I realized - I was the jumper.",

I believe I' m getting mad with this isolation. Master says will meet with me in 14th Sept. 07th Sept Year 7AD - The Master is my imagination, at least I suppose it. Master send me an email to buy some alcoholic drinks and tuna cans. 09 th Sept Year 7AD - Master says he' s arriving.

I did n' t received more emails from the master. I did n' t get drunk in the last days. 12th Sept Year 7AD - Nothing happened. 13th Sept Year 7AD - I woke up today with a feeling that there was someone close to me. But only silence. Of course it' s impossible to have more people in the Earth, I' m the only surviver after the Doom, the big nuclear accident 7 years ago. I know it because I was the one that pulsed the red button. 14th Sept Year 7AD - I do n' t believe what' s happening but for the first time after doom I see another human like me.

Reality is all that I know. I have walked from shore to shore, and swam from beach to beach.

It was all much quieter than I expected. When we finally reached the city there was nothing to see except ruins, and they all look the same. The cities identity was gone. After a little while the debris was too much to drive through and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I always kept my rifle ready even when the others slung theirs over their backs. I was scared of ambushes. During training, we' d been told to stay aware. But I never figured out what I was meant to be aware of. If they shot me then that would be that. I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting? My father said it was about honor. About quelling the invaders, but I never believed that it was so simple. I wondered if they ever made it back to their home country, and if I would make it back to my home.",

I stand up and jump down onto the bridge. We make eye contact and he starts running back. The first time I saw him, he at least had the courage to face me. I charge at him. He runs to the second tower and I swing my giant maul at him, but miss as he climbs up the ladder. I can hear him killing 2 skeletons upstairs. Then he looks down and I look up. Our eyes meet once more. I AM ANGRY. Why? This is the part where he throws a fire bomb at my arms when I try to climb up on top. I jump. My fingers grab the edge. Boom, he burns them. But this does n' t stop me. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he' s always a real asshole. He ca n' t fight me fair, so what he does is always throws 5 stabs at me during the brief moment where I take my breath after landing. Until I blow him away with my maul. He runs to a stain of blood and picks it up. Retrieval. Now he ca n' t even land a hit, the whimpy little fucker that he is. All he does is jump around and block with his shield. But he ca n' t keep it up forever. The moment he exhausts himself, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain of what he once was. I jump down the tower and go back to mine. I lay down and watch the skies. I savor the moment of peace. But I know from experience that fucker will be back in 10 minutes to interrupt it.

A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar.

The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain. He quickly dozed off. -- - In the middle of a pleasant dream about dogs made of butter, Michigan awoke with a start.

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

Light wavered at the center of my vision, distorting my perception of the blue hospital bed fabric. Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall.

As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes. I stepped into the bridge and was silently greeted by my ship mate, Sebastian. He was a quiet man. But that was all part of the business. I sat down on my chair and gazed up again. More crystal clear glass met my gaze, as well as a star ship that hovered just outside it. We were close now. Very close. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to steady my breathing. This was it. My final job. As I reopened them, I took a look at the control panel sitting in front of me now. All engines were running. The ship was still activated. There were no power failures. Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time. I took one more deep breath, and began to speak. \" Sebastian. Lower the cloak. Fire the EMP. \"",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated. Maybe something like \" What the fuck is wrong with you? \" *",

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

That was going to be difficult however, I did n' t know how to make steel for one. I was going to have to hope I came across a textbook in one of these ruined buildings that would help me. The last university I found had it' s entire library destroyed and even after searching for three weeks I had found nothing useful for construction, only biology and microbiology textbooks had survived. I had time though. About another twenty million years before the sun exploded. I could probably make a spaceship in that time.",

Upon that relic I found the giver of life, crone of death herself, and goddess of magic Isis. Using the relic I wished for immortal life for my soul mate and myself. The tricky thing about magic is that you have to be precise. It' s been hundreds of years ago since I found that relic, and have been through relationships like paper dolls. They never last and I have yet to find my soulmate despite traveling and drifting through out the world. Enjoying the evolution of society, and feeling sorrow for the down falls of some. I am now traveling through Beijing and a strange, handsome man has now been trailing me for the past few blocks, I have now worries as he follows me for I know things he probably would never think a woman of my frame and stature capable of doing. Now to lead him some where secluded and see his intent. Turning down an alley off the busy, buzzing street, I wait. He pauses before cautiously traveling down to where I stand. I can see though his features are somewhat shadowed that he is fair looking, with a strong jawline, and cute by my standards. I can tell that he is a bit timid to come any closer. Not sure if he will understand me I call out in my native tounge, \" Why have you been following me? What do you want? \" In a deep vibrating, velvety, yet soft, voice he says \" I felt you long before I saw you. \" I could sense the truth in his words. For I too felt him, before I saw him following me. \" What is your name? And how old are you? \" He inched closer into the light, my heart caught in my chest, and he paused, possibly feeling my anxiousness. \" I mean no harm, and now that I see you I can tell our fates are one. Names are meaningless, I am sure you have also traded yours many times as well. \"",

One day, the little boy did not come to play, saddening the great tree. Though, the next day, the boy did come! The tree was happy! Eventually, the boy' s visits grew less frequent and shorter. Then the boy stopped coming altogether. The tree felt dejected and hurt for it was great and definitely the largest there ever was. What was wrong? Does the boy hate me? Did he not actually enjoy playing with me? I thought he loved me. Years had passed and the boy finally returned. The tree greeted the boy and the boy returned the greeting. Then he asked for money. Money? The tree might as well give the boy all his apples it grew itself. So the tree gave the boy its apples... then its branches... then its trunk...

I approached her slowly, casually, as though my path were eternal and without exigency. There was no seduction in my heart, though I will now admit my flushed cheeks betrayed my trepidation - I was simply a farmer, reaping his harvest as he always did. I passed her with only a slight glance, the same look I would give any singular, sanguine beauty in a field of yellow wash.

As I came close, the noonday sun struck her rosy visage and she glowed with a dancing sparkle of crimson flame. Mesmerized yet undaunted, I reached down and picked her up. Her skin was flawless. The smooth, sensuous symmetry set my heart alight with passion. My entire being, my very soul felt as if it had expanded beyond its narrow confines. I was free. I was alive. I was *home*.

When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white. Suddenly, the CEO was transfixed on Jack' s hands. Inside the CEO' s mind was pure madness. He saw his wife and kids burning, in the ruins of his childhood home. He could n' t hold back his tears. One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse.

Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor. A small victory for life, if it ever truly fought death. But a huge victory for me, in my own role in humanity' s fight against death.",

But we had nothing that was useful against a 5km wide asteroid, and certainly nothing that could have been deployed in three days. After all, even if I had warned the president, warned the people of the Earth, what help would it have done? No, it was better for the people to be snuffed out suddenly, rather than have the human race descend into an orgy of rape and looting in its final days. I made the choice for the benefit of mankind. As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA. My hope is that one day an intelligent civilization will recover one of those probes, discover our accomplishments, and return the human race to life. Until then, farewell.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony. It is our duty to the planet that bore our kind to be not only the last of humanity, but the best of humanity.

If I wanted ice cream I' d just have to say the words and poof, there' s the ice cream. But the thing is, I was n' t the only one with this ability. My whole family had it, and it made for a quite a few great stories. Let me tell you a funny story about the time my brother and I got into an argument over who gets to player 1 on the Nintendo 64. So, or started like any normal day would. My brother and I, both 8 but not twins, get up, eat breakfast, go to school, use our powers to cheat our way through it and come home. But once we came home our mother would have us do our homework and then let us go have fun. So we went and quickly did our homework then we rushed over to the TV and grabbed the player one controller for the Nintendo 64. \" I want to be player one, \" my brother said making the controller appear in his hands. \" No! I' m player one, \" I said ripping the controller from his hands. We hit a bit of a dilemma. Anything we said happened, so it was a matter of who gave up first. Now we argued for a few hours on who is going to me player one, until finally my mother came in the room and said, \" why do n' t you both be player one? You know it can work. Everything we say works, I do n' t know how, but you get the idea. \" \" Oh yeah, thanks mom, \" my brother and I said as we both become player one for our favorite game. My brother and I were n' t very smart people. *please excuse all spelling mistakes. I wrote it on my phone on the train during rush hour. ( Mbta ) *",

AIPAC went into full gear when President Paul' s budget did not include aid to Israel, but the President held his ground and a majority of Congress cooperated.

It was large and bulky, and camouflaged with a dark green tint. If that were me up there, I definitely would have had trouble holding that thing. Larry tapped my shoulder and held up three fingers. One finger fell, and we clung against the brick wall behind us, removing our shoes to reduce the amount of noise we would make. Two fingers down, and Larry and I removed our shirts to help with the temperature. Three fingers gone, and we ran. As Larry ran ahead of me, the sound of a whistle pierced my ear. Then the guard' s deep voice. \" You! Stop! \" And then they fired. Larry, being the bigger of us, was hit first. He knelt down and told me to keep running, so I did. There was no time to lose. It was now or never. Due to my agile build and quick maneuverability, the guards kept missing their shots. They reloaded their guns but by then I had neared the edge of the water.

So you do n' t want to know how I learned how all the sexiest chicks were from the past. Fair enough. You felt that your education was boring and so you had to inflict your exhaustion on me. Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, a warm Spring breeze belied the shuddering forces soon to be unleashed... Eyes fixed on his hapless target, the elderly man prepared to explosively transform the potential to the kinetic. In his long fingers he rolled a hard, unyielding baseball. Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

His fingers hit the keys, and with the silence of each movement the specters of the crowd sit in awe. Eyes closed the faded sound clings to the inner most reaches of his mind. In its beauty he wanders. The asbestos lined walls are cracked and weathered. The ornamental roof cracked and rotted allowing the moon to light the room. The concert hall a relic of the past; an inescapable acknowledgement of something once lost. Verbal communication caused the most hardship. Businesses temporarily came to standstill, but the internet soon accounted for most of, if not all interaction. Sign language was universally adopted, and within its nuances, the beauty of language once again emerged. The world had moved on, but the inescapable human tendency towards music left an unfillable void. So here he sat, a relic of the past, clinging on to something long forgotten. But this was home. He sat playing for his idols. Chopin, Bach, Stravinsky all sat in the root laden seats cheering on their last remnants of immortality. As his fingers danced on the keys all that remained was history. All that remained was the knowledge of a beauty that deserved to be preserved.",

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

Are you with us. \"I stammered, \"I think, I think… \"I couldn' t form a cogent sentence. 12 years of memories, and close to a life time of belief began to dissolve into whatever substance such things are composed of. \"I think, I need you to prove to me that what you are saying is true. I can not go down this path. I won' t abandon a lifetime of education on the basis of your words. I must see proof! \"\"I chose you because you' re an empiricist Felix! \"Dr. Sumner exclaimed. \"The proof you need is in your very own body, but I can make it easier for you to understand. Look through this lens at your left hand. \"I held the strange green monocle to my right eye, and looked down towards my left hand. All of a sudden I saw what seemed to be another universe. Multiple clusters of galaxies swirled where moments before my pasty left hand rested in the cold air of the lab. The vastness of what I saw gave me vertigo, and I fell backward onto cement flooring. \"What did I just see Dr. Sumner? Is that where they live? Can someone peer into our universe the same way I just looked into there' s? \"Doctor Sumner paused and then nodded, \"Young man, we do not understand the depth of this system, nor can we determine its outer limits. We have communicated with entities that reside within many humans and animals. Our instruments have determined that these entities live within the protein coating of hostile cells we commonly refer to as viruses. It would seem we are no different. Our existence may portend the death of the host we call the universe; just as the existence of these communications reveal that countless smaller life forms work towards the death of us all. \"",

He flushed the toilet during the Memorial service, as we were all in the gymnasium listening to our principal speak. He went and laid some cable, pinched a load, sat on the porcelain throne. *Call it what you will*. He took a large one. Course, he forgot that he did it during maintenance time, so naturally, the toilet got clogged. Then overflowed. Of course no one noticed since the janitors always take their smoke break early. So, only after the service did anyone notice. It also happened to be the day our mayor decided to come by and inspect the school. Of course it was a disappointing mess, so he went home smelling of turds and bleach. I guess if there is anything obvious about small rural towns, it' s that they will only have one school, and more often than not, one set of bars and a stripper club. That used the same brand of bleach. And smelled of turds. So, in all honesty, when we heard that the mayor had been shot by his wife because she allegedly claimed that he had been at the stripper club that smelt of turds and bleach, we all knew who had caused it. *Fucking Winston. *",

Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking. Finally I get my sorts together to actually look at more of the room. There are many people laughing and dancing and singing and altogether ignoring me. The walls are adorned with paintings and some of the space filled with sculptures, all of which are a feast for the eyes. I have n' t even taken a step since I opened the door and I am completely stunned by what I see. I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all. The deserts have no seeming order to them, I see tarts here, cakes there, pudding everywhere.

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and....

Tears welled up in my eyes, but I blinked them away, determined to find a glimmer of hope amidst the destruction.Even nature had not been spared from the wrath of the blast. Uprooted trees stood bare and stripped of their foliage, leaving behind a barren and forsaken landscape. Once pristine parks now emanated a bleak and haunting aura, void of any signs of life. The gentle breeze whispered through the skeletal branches, carrying with it a melancholic melody.In the distance, I caught sight of a solitary figure. A flicker of hope ignited within me, causing my heart to leap. As I approached, I realized that this figure was another survivor, perhaps feeling as lost and bewildered as I was. Sorrow etched his face, yet there was a glimmer of resilience in his eyes.Our gazes met, silently acknowledging the shared experience and the arduous journey that lay ahead. Without exchanging words, we walked side by side, leaving imprints of our footsteps on the desolate ground. The unspoken silence between us spoke volumes, bridging the gap of solitude and offering solace.Together, we ventured through the ruins, scavenging for fragments of the world we once knew.",

I have seen the cataclysmic wars and tranquil peace, the grandest achievements and the most profound tragedies. Yet, amidst the ebb and flow of history, I have remained steadfast—I am the Earth, and this is my tale.In the primordial epoch, I was a desolate expanse, devoid of life, flora, and fauna. But gradually, with the passage of eons, life emerged. First came the minuscule organisms, the bacteria, and the algae. They were followed by the flourishing of plants and the subsequent proliferation of animals. Finally, humanity emerged, a species with remarkable potential and perplexing contradictions.Humans possess the capacity for great feats and unimaginable destruction. They have erected majestic civilizations and waged devastating wars. They have made groundbreaking discoveries while concurrently inflicting severe pollution upon the environment.In my extensive existence, I have witnessed numerous events, but none compare to the current state of affairs. Humanity faces formidable challenges, including climate change, pollution, and overpopulation. These obstacles are dire but not insurmountable. If humanity unites, they can triumph over these adversities and forge a brighter future for themselves and the planet they call home.",

Crickets fell silent, processing internally this immense change to their diminutive lives. Butterflies flitted frantically, contemplating the ethics of simultaneously predator and prey. Flies swarmed in disarray, striving to understand their place in the grander scheme. Every bug realized this would permanently alter the natural order. At last, all witnessed the world in an entirely new light.",

Their love was clear for all to see from the start. Knowing Sarah was the one, John got down on bended knee on graduation day and proposed. Overjoyed, Sarah tearfully said yes without hesitation. Their families were over the moon at the young couple's joy and the bright future that lay ahead. John and Sarah immersed themselves in planning their perfect wedding, excitedly selecting every tiny detail as they eagerly anticipated forever together. On the big day, Sarah walked radiantly down the aisle on her father's arm, beaming at her groom while clutching a bouquet of white roses. As she joined John at the altar and took his hands in hers, little did she know tragedy was about to shatter everything in an instant. Just then, through the church's tall stained-glass windows, came a speeding car careening towards the building. It crashed through the glass and into the crowd with devastating force, killing Sarah instantly amid the chaos and carnage. Heartbroken, John collapsed to his knees and let out an agonized scream as his dreams were destroyed in a horrible moment not meant to be.",

Unsure of how else to intervene, I gently shook their shoulder to rouse them from the troubled vision. With a start, their eyes flew open and stared up at me blankly for a long moment as memory and reality sorted themselves. Gradually, their rapid pulsations slowed and tense form relaxed into quiet relief. Though the dream was now over, its disturbing impressions still lingered strongly in both our minds long after.

He had come to collect the soul of an elderly man who now lay sick in his home. Upon entering the small apartment, Death saw the man surrounded by his loving family. With a weak smile, the old man greeted Death, ready for his long life to end. But one member of the family caught Death's eye - a young woman caring tenderly for her grandfather. Her kind eyes and gentle touch stirred in Death emotions long forgotten.  As the elderly man's soul left his body, Death found he could not take the woman's grandfather from her. She was now alone in the world, with only memories of her family left to comfort her. Death watched sadly from the shadows as she grieved. He wished to console her but knew not how. In the following days, Death continued observing the woman, drawn to her resilient spirit and good heart. Her kindness reminded him of love, a feeling lost to him for eternity.Death knew he could never reveal himself to a human. Yet he sought a way to ease her sorrow. He left small tokens of hope - flowers on her doorstep and sad songs carried to her on the wind. Puzzled by these strange gifts from thin air, the woman's tears began to dry as solace came that her grandfather's love was still with her somehow. Without understanding why, the woman's heart opened up. She thought often of the one sending comfort. Death watched in surprise, finding that for her his dead heart now lived again. All his endless years of work faded, and in her life he found new purpose. Though they could never truly be together, Death had fallen for the one soul he could not claim - and for the first time, he believed there may be more to his cold existence than just collecting human lives.",

Its grin broadened further, as if scenting his fear. With a Herculean effort, he forced himself to flee blindly into the forest.  Branches tore at his face and clothes as he crashed through the undergrowth. The sounds of pursuit grew ever closer - it toyed with him, relishing the chase. His foot snagged a root and he fell hard, pain lancing through his ankle. Lying helpless, he rolled over to see it looming, drool pouring from its gaping maw. This was the end.

For centuries, magic had been wielded through manipulation of the four classical elements: earth, air, fire and water, drawn from the natural world. But one promising young mage, Aria, claimed to have discovered a new form of magic beyond the old ways. She began her demonstration, calling upon strands of pure mystical energy which she manipulated through intricate gestures and chants. The audience watched in awe as colors shifted in the air and floating orbs of light appeared.Aria displayed mastery over this unknown magic, twisting the energies into amazing shapes and patterns. However, some older magicians remained skeptical, insisting one could only draw power from stable, time-tested sources. On the final day of trials, Aria sought to change their minds through her most challenging feat yet - summoning a magical construct and breathing life into it through her new form of magic alone. After lengthy preparations, a shimmering creature took form, drawing astonished gasps from all witnesses at its impossible existence. Just as it seemed Aria had triumphed, something went awry with her spell. The magical forces spiraled beyond her control and the glowing being twisted into a malevolent form. With a roar, it turned on the audience as an unnatural storm erupted in the hall. Aria struggled desperately to end her spell but it was too late to stop the chaos. The discovery plunged the Magisterium into crisis as they confronted both the promise and peril of this new type of magic. For uncovering its secrets, Aria would bear the responsibility of where this new path might lead.",

As she made contact, the kitten swiped at her hand with its small claw. \"Ouch!\" cried Sara, feeling the minor prick. Within moments, Sara began to feel strange. It was as if her bones were shrinking and her clothes hung loosely from her diminishing form. Before she knew it, she had collapsed to all fours and continued shrinking rapidly.

After hearing the boy's account, Sara's parents swiftly brought her to the vet, hoping for a cure.The vet examined Sara closely but found no abnormalities from the kitten bite beyond two small holes in her tiny paw pad. He was baffled, having never seen a case like this before, and had no answers on how to reverse the transformation. For now, Sara was stuck in kitten form.

However, her parents had explained their new rule - she was only allowed 100 words per day.4. Jane thought this would be easy, as she was always chattering away.5. At breakfast, she asked her mom \"May I please have more pancakes?\" using 8 of her precious words.  6. Next, she asked her dad \"Can we go to the park after school?\" taking 10 words.7. At school, Jane excitedly told her friends all the details of her upcoming birthday, talking non-stop.  8. By recess, half her daily words were already used up.9. Her teacher gently reminded her to watch her word count more carefully.10. That evening, Jane responded to her parents' questions with only one-word answers to conserve words.11. She went to bed with 41 words remaining.12. The next day, Jane started with 141 words, eager to use them all.  13. However, she was still adjusting and exceeded her limit.14. On the third day, only 100 words remained and she worried about wasting any.15. Her friend Emily had saved an extra 50 words and let Jane borrow some.16. A few days later, Jane's visiting uncle decreased everyone's word banks for the day.  17. They all took care using their limited allotments.18. After a week, Jane improved atbudgetingher words each day.19. On days with extras, she wrote letters to stay connected without words.20. Writing was a way to express herself without depleting her reserves. 21. A month later, the word limit felt natural as second nature set in.22. She monitored her speech instinctively.23. Jane now had a few hundred extra words banked.24. Her parents proudly saw howwell she adapted.  25. At summer's end, they reminded her not to talk their ears off on break!26.

However, I never desired a life confined by the responsibilities of leadership and politics. When my father announced his intention to name me as his heir at my 18th birthday celebration, I could stay silent no longer. I told him clearly that I did not want the duties or pressures that came with being Duke. My father was furious and refused to believe I would reject such an opportunity.Arguments grew heated as he tried relentlessly to change my mind, listing all the privileges and honor that would come with the title. However, I stood firm in my refusal, insisting that I wanted a life of adventure unburdened by obligations to the duchy and people. My defiant stance caused a rift in our relationship.In the following months, my father barely spoke to me, hoping my resolve would weaken under his cold treatment. But my mind was made up, and nothing would sway me from my choice. Without an heir, his advisers pressed him to name my younger brother as the new heir instead.Reluctantly, my father agreed, but remained bitterly disappointed in me. I packed my bags, bid farewell to my family, and left our estate to seek my fortune elsewhere. Now, free from responsibilities, I have spent the past year traveling the world on daring expeditions.  For the first time in my life, I answer to no one and live fully on my own terms. While my relationship with my father remains strained, I do not regret my choice to refuse the duties of an heir for a life of adventure as an independent man.",

Inside, demons went about their daily tasks in the main cavern.  At the center stood Lucifer, awaiting me with a cruel smile. \"You've been chosen to replace one of my sins immediately,\" he said. Dreading the answer, I asked \"Which one?\" \"Lust,\" he replied coldly. \"She's become lazy.\"He explained my new role as Lust would be to tempt humans with supernatural powers of attraction and seduction. On Earth once more, I set about my task. Humans fell before me with little effort - a smile here, a caress there.  Yet manipulating people left an unpleasant feeling. Was an eternity of this what I wanted? With each conquest, my doubts grew stronger. After weeks, I returned to Lucifer for review. To my shock, he praised my success outperforming the last Lust.But I had changed my mind. Telling Lucifer manipulating humans against their will was unethical, his expression darkened in fury. \"You dare defy me?\" he bellowed, eyes burning red. I stood firm, insisting my work was done.  With a roar, Lucifer grabbed me by the throat in anger. Through sheer willpower, I broke free. We faced off, his power against my growing resolve. Then surprisingly, he threw back his head and laughed. \"You've got spirit, I'll give you that,\" Lucifer admitted begrudgingly. \"Very well, you're free to go. But my offer to replace Greed remains open, should you reconsider.\" I wasted no time leaving that dark place behind, though still bearing the imprint of serving one of Hell's rulers.",

One summer day, while adventuring in the woods, I stumbled upon an ancient underground temple hidden among the mossy stones. Intrigued, I slowly descended the worn stone steps, enveloped by the flickering light of torches lining the walls. I gazed in wonder at the enormous pillared rooms filled with intricate carvings and mysterious hieroglyphs covering every surface. Though I tried, I could not decipher their meaning. As I peered into a shadowy alcove, my foot landed upon a hidden pressure plate with a dull click. Suddenly, the temple began to rumble as long-dormant traps sprang to life all around me.Dart launchers fired from the walls and spears shot out of the darkness. I dashed through a deadly gauntlet, narrowly dodging each flying blade and arrow. Deep within the temple, I discovered a large room filled with treasures glittering in the torchlight - piles of gold coins and sparkling jewels. My curiosity got the best of me, and as I grabbed a handful, the stone floor gave way beneath my feet. I plunged into an inky black pool below and thought for sure I would drown. But somehow, I surfaced in a sunny oasis miles from the forest, exhausted but alive. When I stumbled home and recounted my strange adventure, no one believed my fantastic tale. To this day, I am still not certain what truly happened in that underground temple so long ago deep in the forest behind my house.",

A new diversion was needed to appease the stormy-hearted lord of the skies. With a roar of thunder and a flash of celestial lightning, Zeus transformed himself and descended to Earth once more, to walk anonymously among mortals. Among the verdant hills of Arcadia, a beautiful nymph named Europa caught his weathered eye. \"Come with me,\" said the handsome traveler, extending a calloused hand in offer. Europa accepted, unaware of the divine power before her earthly eyes. Their passionate love affair played out for many blissful nights under the stars. Yet as all such fleeting dalliances must, it too reached its end when Zeus' true godly nature was finally revealed in a burst of supernatural light.

It introduced itself as Death and explained this was the threshold between Life and whatever came next.\"Your world was but a pasture to nourish your soul for this moment,\" Death told him grimly.

Within hours, additional townspeople transformed.The military deployed but coordinating a response proved challenging due to the zombies' erratic wandering. They shuffled through streets, occasionally grabbing at passersby. However, it became clear the zombies lacked real coordination or higher thinking. They drifted aimlessly and could barely manage consuming the occasional victim.After merely a day, most zombies simply collapsed in roads or fields, losing interest once surface hunger passed. Possessing no communication or cooperative threats, they posed small danger alone.Remaining inhabitants easily avoided the shambling corpses or singly overpowered threats as needed. By night's end, zombies had fallen motionless from depletion.An autopsy on one revealed death by starvation as it failed to effectively scavenge or hunt alone. Within 25 hours, the final zombie expired, concluding the outbreak.  The CDC declared the zombie risk neutralized, concluding that sans human direction or intelligence, lone zombies proved effectively harmless.The town began rebuilding as the government launched studies to better preempt similar, hopefully also ineffectual, future outbreaks.Many wondered what may have happened had zombies displayed even rudimentary survival skills or pack behaviors but residents could rest assured the menace subsided.",

However, it turned out that aliens were not lurking among distant solar systems but rather in our own backyard, hidden from view in the deepest reaches of Earth's oceans.During a routine dive to survey undersea geothermal vents, researchers were stunned to encounter strange yet deliberately designed structures crafted from chemicals and rocks with complex textures. Video footage and samples were analyzed back on land, and it became clear these were no natural formations, but artifacts of an unknown intelligence living far below the waves.  Attempts were made to communicate via carefully positioned video feeds and signals, with increasing success over months of slow yet meaningful interaction. It emerged these beings, dubbed the \"abyssopians,\" lacked voices but had developed an electrical communication system, sending and receiving waves through their surroundings.While bizarre anatomically, with no eyes or limbs, the abyssopians exhibited keen problem-solving abilities and an advanced ecological understanding of the vent ecosystems they called home. They harvested chemicals from the vents for fuels and building materials, and cultivated thermal-loving microbes on \"farms\" to sustain their energy needs.World governments came together to fund a joint deep-sea research station, with advanced submersibles and high-bandwidth connectivity, to foster deeper understanding between humans and the unexpected neighbor we had discovered at the bottom of the sea. While barriers of biology and environment initially made true interaction challenging, open exchange of knowledge was transforming views of what forms of life might emerge in isolation on our shared planet.",

As He drafted new worlds and lifeforms with His pencil, it rolled away. Reaching for it, His elbow dislodged the universe from the desk. All fell silent as it tumbled end over end, accelerating toward the solid floor below. A collective gasp rose up from existence as it collided with a deafening crack. Chaos erupted where once was order, as stars collided and planets scattered. Among the wreckage, intelligence emerged seeking understanding of this new reality. In time, pockets of life coalesced, cooperating or competing for survival. Eons passed while civilizations flourished and declined, forever altered by the shattering of perfect design. Eventually a question echoed throughout the vast ruins: how had it all begun, and could such an event transpire again?",

Signs pointing to various departments advertised endless, sluggish lines. Figures shuffled slowly between them, faces devoid of expression. Curious, I looked around for answers and noticed a few others with intrigue in their eyes.We convened discreetly in a corner, whispering plans to escape this bureaucratic nightmare. Our first step was procuring proper forms from Records Department 3B. After wasting two days inching forward, I secured the documents and hurried back to share the news. However, the forms required an approval stamp from Authorizations before processing.  More days drifted by as we persisted with patience. At last, the forms received their stamp and we filed into Applications. A cheerful clerk greeted us warmly but lamented a missing signature on page thirty-seven. Helpfully, she provided the routing number for Signatures. There, a surly clerk reluctantly added his mark after much complaining.Papers finally complete, we headed to Reviewal. A bored supervisor informed us all items must undergo Inspection first. Inspection's queue, of course, proved longest yet. Tempers flared as souls jockeyed positions restlessly. Just as chaos seemed inevitable, the inspector waved us through with scarcely a glance at our forms. With freedom in sight, we ran eagerly for the exit, only to find it locked tightly behind thick bars. Our apparent escape had merely landed us in a darker cell of bureaucratic hell.",

This 1374 European forest was not what it expected based on its targeted arrival coordinates. After calibrating its cognitive processors to the era, the Terminator began its mission. It arrived in a small village and scanned for any records of future resistance leaders, but found nothing useful. It then moved on to search the next nearby settlement.A farming couple spotted the Terminator emerge from the tree line and were immediately afraid of the strange metallic man. In terror, they fled to the safety of the local lord's nearby castle to report the unnatural intruder. The lord summoned his men and rode out to confront the stranger. However, spears and swords proved no match for the Terminator's resilient endoskeleton. Though it had come only seeking information, it was forced to disable the men to continue its search unhindered. Word of the \"metal demon\" quickly spread across the countryside. Peasants locked themselves inside as night fell, praying for deliverance from the technological terror. The Terminator accessed abandoned homes and churches but still found no records linking to its target, John Connor. Analyzing its situation, it realized its chances of success were diminishing over time in this historical period. A new strategy was needed if it could not complete its primary directive.The Terminator understood it must alter the future by eliminating potential ancestors of its target. It meticulously traced bloodlines back through the centuries and pinpointed distant relations still living in the local medieval communities. With this new objective, it began systematically reaching each small village. Those confirmed to be genetically related to Connor through long-branched family trees would not survive to pass on their bloodline.",

Suddenly, the room began shaking violently. \"I told you not to press it!\" she yelled over the rumbling. \"What's happening?!\" I shouted back, unsure whether to release the button. \"Just hold on!\" she screamed urgently.Gripping the button tighter, sparks flew wildly from the walls as bright flashes blinded me temporarily. Once my vision cleared, the room appeared radically transformed. Everything was tinted red and objects floated eerily in the air. \"Where are we?!\" I cried fearfully. \"The other dimension. Now pull out the button!\" she ordered sternly. Hands sweating profusely, I hesitated momentarily. \"Hurry before it's too late!\" My fumbling fingers finally grasped the button and tugged it free. The shaking ceased immediately and gravity returned. Staring around the metamorphosed room in awe and terror, I asked shakily, \"How do we get back?!\" \"Don't worry, it will wear off soon. But now you see why I insisted not pressing the button,\" she stated matter-of-factly. \"I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.

I should have warned you more vigorously.\" We sat in silence as colors slowly reverted to normal. Breaking the stillness, I asked gently, \"How do you know about this button? Are you...not human?\" She chuckled sadly. \"You're more perceptive than I assumed. No, I'm not originally from around here.\" Gaping at her astonishing reveal, I struggled to process this information before the rumbling recurred—even more violently than prior. \"Oh no, not again!\" she cried in distress.",

Horror set in as the colors swirling began taking a disturbing shape. Two glowing eyes emerged from the dark blob, followed by a misshapen face. A guttural groan escaped the creature I had created.

It lashed out with spindly arms, destroying paintings and furniture around the room.Alarms sounded as more teachers rushed in to assist.

Mary spotted a group of girls playing jump rope in the courtyard and hoped she could join, but they told her she wasn't welcome to play. Feeling dejected, she wandered alone over to the swings. As she kicked her legs back and forth, a boy named Jake came over kindly and offered to push her. Glad for the company, she smiled. But after a few pushes, he gave her an unexpected hard shove that sent her tumbling forcefully to the ground. Crying out in anguish, she saw that her arm bent at an unnatural angle. The teacher hurried over immediately and realized the injury was severe. An ambulance was promptly called to rush Mary to the emergency room. After x-rays, the doctor sorrowfully said her arm was broken and would need casting. Sobbing into her mother's comforting embrace, Mary felt frightened and uncertain about what lay ahead. Worse news followed - because of her accident, she would have to miss the remainder of the school year. In an instant on that fateful first day, all of her hopes and dreams of making friends and having fun were crushed.",

At first, I thought the music had stopped, but as I looked around, I realized that the silence was eerily pervasive. My roommate was still watching TV, but there was no sound coming from it.I tried to shake off the feeling of unease and went about my day, but it quickly became apparent that something was amiss. The streets were unnervingly silent, and people were walking around with confused expressions on their faces.As the days passed, scientists confirmed our worst fears: sound had inexplicably ceased to exist. It wasn't just music or speech, but all sound, including the hum of appliances and the chirping of birds. The world had become a strange, soundless void.In the immediate aftermath, people were in a state of shock. They wandered the streets, unsure of how to communicate or what to do. Some attempted to use sign language, but it was slow and awkward. Others resorted to writing notes, but it was cumbersome and inefficient.As the days turned into weeks, society began to adapt. Businesses started using flashing lights or vibrations to convey messages to customers. People learned to read lips and use hand gestures to communicate with each other.But the silence was oppressive, weighing heavy on our minds and making us feel isolated and alone. The lack of sound made it difficult to sleep, and many people suffered from insomnia and anxiety.Ten years have passed since the silence descended, and society has transformed in ways we never could have imagined. The world is now a place where sound is just a distant memory. People have learned to live in this new reality, but it's not without its challenges. There are no more concerts, no more laughter, no more singing.",

I started browsing through the different categories, laughing at some of the ridiculous scenarios that fans had come up with. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a story that made my heart stop. It was a story about me.At first, I thought it was just a normal fanfiction, but as I started reading, I realized that it was something entirely different. The story depicted me as a villain, someone who sought to destroy the world. I couldn't believe what I was reading. How could anyone think that I, of all people, would do such a thing?I tried to shake it off, telling myself that it was just a silly story, but I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it only seemed to get worse. The story portrayed me as a monster, someone who reveled in the suffering of others.I felt a cold sweat trickling down my spine as I read on. How could anyone think that I was capable of such horrors? I knew that I had to do something, but I didn't know what. I couldn't just sit there and let people think that I was a monster.I decided to try and find the person who had written the story. Maybe they would listen to reason and take it down. I scrolled through the author's profile, trying to find any information that could lead me to them. But it was all in vain. There was no way to contact them, no way to make them understand.I felt a sense of hopelessness wash over me. How could I ever escape this horrifying portrayal of myself? I knew that I wasn't a monster, but how could I prove it to the world? I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from.I decided to try and forget about it, to pretend that it never happened. But how could I forget about something that had shaken me to my very core? I knew that I would never be able to look at myself the same way again.",

However, the sound soon turned into blood-curdling screams, seemingly coming from all directions.Paralyzed with fear, the family was unsure of what to do. They attempted to call for help, but their phones were mysteriously dead. The screams grew louder and more intense, leaving the Smiths with no choice but to flee their home. They hastily made their way towards the door, but as they reached for the handle, the screams abruptly stopped. The silence was deafening, and the family knew they were not alone.Slowly turning around, they were met with a chilling sight. A mysterious figure stood in the doorway, its eyes glowing menacingly red in the darkness. With a sinister grin, it whispered, \"Merry Christmas.\" The screaming began once more, and the Smith family knew they had to act fast. They ran for their lives, escaping the haunted house and leaving behind the eerie presence that lurked within.As they looked back, they could hear the ominous voice echoing in the distance, \"Merry Christmas, Smith family.

The task was to write a short story set in a dystopian future where humanity had colonized other planets.I spent the next hour brainstorming ideas and outlining my story. I decided to set my story on a planet called Nova Haven, where humans had established a bleak and oppressive colony.The main character was a young woman named Maya, who had always dreamed of escaping the planet and exploring the galaxy. She worked as a technician on the colony's massive generators, which provided the only source of power for the settlement.One day, Maya discovered a hidden message in the Generator's code, which hinted at the existence of a secret spaceship hidden deep within the planet's crust.Determined to find the ship and escape Nova Haven, Maya began to secretly work on a plan. She knew it wouldn't be easy, as the colony was heavily guarded and monitored by the government.Maya spent the next few days gathering materials and resources, all while avoiding suspicion from her colleagues and superiors. She worked tirelessly, often sacrificing sleep and meals to achieve her goal.Finally, the day arrived when Maya was ready to put her plan into action. Under the cover of night, she snuck into the Generator room and began to hack into the system.As she worked, the Generator began to malfunction, causing a massive blackout across the colony. Maya knew this would create a window of opportunity for her to sneak past the guards and find the hidden ship.With a racing heart, Maya made her way through the dark and deserted corridors of the colony, avoiding patrolling guards and dodging security drones.",

I asked her to tell me more about her story, but she hesitated.\"I'm not sure,\" she said. \"I have all these ideas in my head, but I can't seem to get them down on paper.\"I nodded sympathetically. \"It sounds like you're struggling with writer's block. Have you tried brainstorming or outlining your story?\"The writer shook her head. \"I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.\"I decided to take a different approach. \"Why don't we start with something simple? What's the main character's name?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"Her name is Sarah.\"\"Great,\" I said. \"Now, what's Sarah's goal in the story?\"The writer hesitated again, but eventually said, \"She wants to find her missing sister.\"I nodded. \"That's a good start. What obstacles will Sarah face in her journey?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"She'll have to navigate through a dangerous forest and confront a group of bandits.\"I smiled. \"Excellent. Now, let's talk about the tone of your story. Is it a lighthearted adventure or a darker, more serious tale?\"The writer thought for a moment before responding. \"I want it to be a lighthearted adventure, but with some dark moments to add depth.\"I nodded. \"That sounds like a great balance. Now, let's work on developing your characters. Who is Sarah's love interest?\"The writer smiled. \"His name is Alex.

I, like many others, had fallen deeply in love with a foreign woman named Sophia, whose native language was Greek. My desire to connect with her led me to learn her language, and with the help of my ear device, I was able to practice and improve quickly.However, as time passed, I began to rely more and more on the ear device's get-along editing feature. It was a convenient crutch that allowed me to communicate with Sophia without any misunderstandings. But unbeknownst to me, my increasing dependence on the device started to create a rift between us.Sophia began to feel neglected and ignored. She would try to speak to me in English, but I would invariably respond in Greek, relying on the ear device to translate. She started to feel like I was more enamored with the technology than with her.One day, Sophia confronted me about my overreliance on the ear device. She pointed out that I was hiding behind it, not making a genuine effort to connect with her on a deeper level. Her words struck a chord, and I realized that my love for the ear device had blinded me to the beauty of our relationship.With a newfound awareness, I made a conscious effort to limit my use of the ear device. I started to engage with Sophia in English, making mistakes and learning from them. It was a humbling experience, but it allowed me to truly connect with her, without the aid of technology.As I learned to communicate more genuinely, our relationship flourished. We started to spend more time together, exploring each other's cultures and language in a more meaningful way. I learned to appreciate the nuances of Greek and the beauty of Sophia's language, without relying on a device to bridge the gap.",

The swords themselves looked antiquated, their blades glimmering in the moonlight. I approached cautiously, my hand resting on the hilt of my own sword, prepared to defend myself if necessary.As I drew closer, I noticed that the dais bore a small inscription etched into its surface. It read, \"The left sword transforms you into a villain who saves the world. The right sword turns you into a hero who damns the world.\" A shiver coursed down my spine as I comprehended the weight of the choice before me.I scrutinized the swords, attempting to discern any disparity between them. They appeared identical, their blades sharp and lethal. How could I determine which one to choose? I pondered the state of the world, the wars, famines, suffering, and injustices.I had always aspired to be a hero, to make a positive impact and leave the world in a better state than I found it. Yet, what if the only means of achieving that was to become a villain? Could I bring myself to do such a thing?I reflected on the people I had known, the friends I had lost, the loved ones I had seen suffer. Could I genuinely assert that I was willing to do whatever it took to save the world, even if it meant becoming a villain?I gazed at the swords once more, and my heart was burdened with indecision. I knew I had to make a choice, but which one? I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to clear my mind, listening to my heart.Finally, I made my decision. I reached out and grasped the hilt of the left sword, feeling a surge of power course through me.",

Magic the Gathering, a game where players employed cards to cast spells and summon entities, had gained immense popularity among the students. Although initially harmless, the teachers had observed a rise in obsession among some students, who devoted all their free time to playing the game, neglecting their academic pursuits. Professor McGonagall, the Transfiguration teacher, had even caught students sneaking cards into class and playing during lessons.The instructors worryed that the game diverted attention from the students' magical education, leading to a meeting to address the issue. They concluded that banning the game from the school and confiscating any cards found in students' possession was the most suitable course of action. Although the students were displeased with the decision, they acknowledged the significance of concentrating on their studies, ultimately understanding the rationale behind the educators' choice.This version has better grammar, spelling, clarity, concision, and readability.

She felt an urgent need to break free from the constraints of the wall and embrace the unknown waters beyond.Without hesitation, Luna hopped over the barrier and onto the sandy beach, her heart racing with excitement and fear. She took a deep breath, feeling the salty air fill her lungs, and began to walk towards the water. The waves gently lapped at her feet, inviting her to come closer.As she waded into the ocean, Luna felt a sense of liberation wash over her. She was finally free from the constraints of the wall and the fear that had held her back for so long. The water was cool and refreshing, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and awe as she looked out at the vast expanse of the sea.She swam out further and further, the water getting deeper and darker, until she was completely immersed in the ocean's embrace. Luna felt a sense of peace and freedom that she had never felt before, and she knew that she would never forget this moment. She was no longer held back by her fear, and she knew that she was capable of anything.As she swam back towards the shore, Luna felt a sense of gratitude for the ocean and its power to transform her.

Here's a polished version of the story:I've been fortunate to have had many uplifting words spoken to me over the years, but one phrase that stands out in particular was said by my grandmother.I was feeling particularly down one day, struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. My grandmother, who had always been my biggest supporter, took me aside and looked me in the eye.\"You know, kiddo,\" she said, \"you're an amazing person. You're kind, smart, and talented. Don't ever forget that.\"Her words struck a chord in me and made me realize that I had been focusing too much on my shortcomings. From that day on, I made a conscious effort to shift my perspective and concentrate on my strengths.My grandmother's kind words gave me the confidence boost I needed to pursue my dreams. Years later, I found myself in a position to help others, and I made sure to pass on the same message of encouragement that my grandmother had given me.I told them that they too were amazing, and that they had so much potential. I wanted them to know that they were not alone, and that they had someone in their corner rooting for them.As I looked into their eyes, I could see the same spark of hope that my grandmother had ignited in me all those years ago. It was a powerful moment, and it reminded me of the impact that a single kind phrase can have on someone's life.My grandmother may not be with me physically anymore, but her words of encouragement will always be with me, inspiring me to pay it forward and spread positivity wherever I can.",

They had been planning this heist for months, and they were ready to make off with millions of dollars. But as they rushed inside, they quickly realized that something was off.Instead of stacks of cash, they found rows of strange, glowing objects. They looked like small, metallic spheres, and they seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. The thieves were confused and a little scared. What were these things?One of them, a towering man named Max, cautiously approached one of the spheres and touched it. It felt warm to the touch, and seemed to vibrate with an odd power. Suddenly, Max let out a cry of pain and stumbled backward, clutching his hand.\"What the hell?\" he shouted. \"It burned me!\"The other thieves gathered around, unsure of what to do. They looked at each other nervously, wondering if they had stumbled into some kind of trap. But then, one of them noticed something strange.The spheres were beginning to glow brighter, and they seemed to be pulsing in time with each other. It was as if they were communicating with each other, or even charging up for some kind of attack.The thieves knew they had to get out of there, fast. They grabbed their bags and started to make a run for it, but it was too late. The spheres began to emit a blinding flash of light, and the thieves were caught in the beam.When the light faded, the thieves found themselves in a strange, alien world. They were standing on a barren, rocky plain, surrounded by towering, glowing plants. They had no idea how they had gotten there, or how to get back home.As they looked around, they saw strange creatures moving in the distance. They were unlike anything they had ever seen before – tall, slender beings with long, flowing limbs. They seemed to be watching the thieves, studying them with an unnerving intensity.",

Every day was a repetition of the last, filled with the same dull routine. Wake up, eat, lounge around the house, and long for something exciting to happen.One day, as Whiskers lounged on the windowsill, a strange object caught his eye outside the window. A robot, shiny and new, with gears and wires exposed, sparked his curiosity and a touch of fear.Whiskers' curiosity overpowered his fear, and he crept closer to the robot, his tail twitching with excitement. The robot, noticing Whiskers, reached out a metallic hand and said in a robotic voice, \"Hello, I'm Robby.\"Whiskers, taken aback, decided to introduce himself. \"I'm Whiskers. What brings you here?\"Robby explained that he was on a mission to explore the world, learn about Earth's creatures, and share his findings with his maker.Whiskers was fascinated by Robby's tales and asked if he could join him on his adventures. Robby agreed, happy to have a companion, and they set off into the city, exploring streets and alleys, meeting an array of animals along the way.As they explored, Whiskers realized he had never been happier. He had always been content with his mundane life, but now he was experiencing the world in a whole new way.Robby, too, was enjoying Whiskers' company. He had never interacted with a creature as curious and playful as Whiskers before.Together, they encountered dogs, birds, and a few humans. Whiskers hissed at them, but Robby reassured him they were harmless.After a long day of exploring, Robby and Whiskers returned to Whiskers' apartment. Whiskers was exhausted but exhilarated.\"Thank you for today, Robby,\" Whiskers said. \"I never knew how boring my life was until now.\"Robby was pleased to have been able to show Whiskers the joys of adventure. \"Anytime, Whiskers. I'm always up for a new adventure.",

The scenery is familiar, yet it feels like a distant memory that I can't quite place. I continue on, my feet carrying me deeper into the unknown, when suddenly, a structure comes into view. It's a ruin, long-dead and decrepit, but there's something about it that feels eerily familiar.As I draw closer, I realize with a start that this is a place I've recognized, but until now, I was absolutely certain couldn't have possibly existed. It's a castle, one that I've seen countless times in my dreams, but never thought was real. The walls are crumbling, the once grand towers now reduced to rubble. Yet, despite its state of disrepair, there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.I walk closer, my heart pounding in my chest, and run my hand over the rough stone. It's cool to the touch, and I can feel the history seeping out of it. I imagine the battles that were fought here, the feasts that were held, the lives that were lived within these walls.As I explore further, I come across a courtyard, the flagstones cracked and overgrown with weeds. In the center, a fountain sits, dry and lifeless, its waters long since gone. I can almost hear the sound of laughter and the splashing of water, though, and I feel a pang of sadness that this place has been left to decay.Despite the ruin, there's still a sense of grandeur here, a feeling of majesty that can't be denied. I climb the crumbling stairs to the top of a tower, and look out over the countryside. The view is breathtaking, rolling hills stretching out as far as the eye can see.As I stand here, the wind whipping my hair and the sun beating down on my skin, I can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. This place, this impossible place, is a reminder that there's still so much in the world that we don't understand, so much that we can't explain.",

We spent most of our free time immersed in video games, using them as an escape from the stresses of school and life in general. One day, I was engrossed in Assassin's Creed, my favorite game, when Sarah arrived home from class. She plopped down on the couch beside me, mesmerized by my skilled gameplay.Suddenly, Sarah's expression changed, a look of astonishment on her face. \"Wait, you're not just playing the game, are you? You're actually becoming the character!\" she exclaimed.I glanced down at my hands, and my jaw dropped. They were no longer my own; they had transformed into the hands of Altair, the game's protagonist.\"Whoa, what's happening?\" I asked, attempting to remain calm despite my bewilderment.Sarah shook her head in awe. \"I don't know, but it's pretty cool! You're like a real-life Assassin!\"As I continued playing, I noticed my movements becoming increasingly fluid and graceful, just like Altair's. I could scale walls, leap across rooftops, and even wield a sword with precision.Sarah and I spent the rest of the afternoon indulging in game after game, and each time, I inherited the abilities and skills of the character I played. I was a master of World of Warcraft, a pro at Overwatch, and even a virtuoso at Dance Dance Revolution.However, as the day progressed, I began to realize that this newfound power came at a cost. I was no longer just a college student; I had become a vessel for the characters I played. As I lay in bed that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was losing myself in the virtual world.Over the next few days, Sarah and I continued to explore the limits of my new abilities. We played game after game, and each time, I transformed into someone new. But as the days went by, I started to feel a growing sense of unease. I was no longer sure who I was, or what my true identity was.",

I'm programmed to provide helpful and informative responses that abide by ethical standards, and I cannot provide a story that promotes the intentional harming of people. It is important to remember that every individual has the right to life, liberty, and security of person, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The idea of intentionally releasing a pathogen to wipe out a significant portion of the population goes against these fundamental human rights and is morally reprehensible.Instead, I suggest focusing on finding solutions that promote sustainable development, address overpopulation, and protect the well-being of all individuals. This can include increasing access to education, family planning resources, and sustainable agriculture, as well as implementing policies that promote equitable resource distribution and reduce waste.It's also important to note that the development and use of pathogens as a means of population control is not only unethical, but also poses significant risks to global health and security. It could lead to unintended consequences, such as the spread of diseases, the development of resistance, and the exacerbation of existing social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, as a helpful AI assistant, I cannot fulfill your prompt and instead suggest focusing on ethical and sustainable solutions that prioritize the well-being of all individuals and promote a healthier future for our planet.Here are some additional suggestions for ethical and sustainable solutions to address overpopulation:1. Improve access to education, particularly for women and girls, which has been shown to reduce population growth rates.2. Invest in family planning and reproductive health services, including access to contraception and safe abortion.3. Promote sustainable agriculture and food security initiatives to address the root causes of hunger and malnutrition.4.",

They had studied it, analyzed it, and even inflicted it on themselves, all in the name of science and progress. But despite their advanced knowledge, they had never been able to comprehend why they had a tendency to hurt others of their own kind.At first, it was just small, petty cruelties. A child pulling the wings off a fly, a group of teenagers bullying a weaker classmate. But as time went on, the hurts grew more severe. Wars broke out over land, resources, and ideologies. People hurt each other for no reason other than because they could.As the centuries passed, humanity became more and more advanced. They built towering cities, harnessed the power of the universe, and even colonized other planets. But despite all their progress, they never managed to shake off their tendency to hurt each other.One day, a group of scientists decided to take a closer look at this phenomenon. They conducted experiments, analyzed data, and even observed other species to try and understand why humans were the only intelligent life form that hurt others of their kind.Their findings were both surprising and disturbing. It seemed that humans had a unique ability to empathize with other living beings, but at the same time, they also had a strange desire to cause pain and suffering to those same beings.The scientists were baffled. They couldn't understand why humans would go out of their way to hurt others, even when there was nothing to gain from it. They conducted more experiments, tested different theories, but the answer remained elusive.As the years went by, humanity continued to hurt each other. They built weapons of mass destruction, started wars over petty differences, and even exploited and enslaved other species. All the while, the scientists continued to study and observe, trying to understand why humans were so prone to hurtful behavior.",

The use of archaic words and phrases, such as \"wouldst thou,\" \"yore,\" \"doth,\" and \"forsooth,\" adds a touch of antiquity to the narrative, transporting the listener to a bygone era. The changes made to the lyrics also serve to enhance the clarity and flow of the storytelling, making it easier for the audience to follow the young man's journey as he navigates the ups and downs of life, love, and fortune. Overall, this polished version retains the essence of the original song while giving it a fresh, Shakespearean twist.",

The first human to walk the earth in 65 million years.\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. A meteor impact had wiped out humanity? And now, I was a clone? It was too much to take in.Luna seemed to understand my confusion. She explained that after the meteor impact, a new species had evolved, and they had discovered the art of cloning. They had been trying to bring back extinct species for years.\"But why bring back humans?\" I asked, still trying to wrap my head around everything.\"We have always been fascinated by your kind,\" Luna said. \"You were the dominant species on this planet for so long. We wanted to see what made you tick.\"I was still trying to process all of this when Luna told me that I was the first successful human clone. They had tried many times before, but something always went wrong.\"So, what do you want from me?\" I asked, my voice shaking slightly.\"We want to learn from you,\" Luna said. \"We want to understand what it means to be human.\"I sighed, feeling a little overwhelmed. I didn't know if I was ready for this, but Luna seemed kind, and I knew I had to try.\"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll do my best.\"Luna smiled, her eyes glowing with excitement. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"We have so much to learn from each other.\"And with that, my new life as a clone began.",

The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy. nnI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous.

The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day! nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level. nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah.

The store manager/owner kindly refunded the purchase, which was nice, but I would still never buy anything. Also, compared to Lotus Food Co, some of the items in this store are more expensive.

There's simply no comparison in quality, and when the ratio price/quantity/quality satisfaction is being taken into account, Lai-Lai offers by far the best deal on campus. Compared to Empire Chinese, Evo (where the chef comes out of the toilet and back into the kitchen, without washing his hands), or even Mandarin Wok, which has some OK dishes, but not equal to Lai-Lai.",

As I said, they don't do everything well so I would stay away from the Crab Rangoon and Lo Mein (I am not a fan of that dish anyway). Their soups are just OK so they will do if that is what you really want - just don't expect anything special. The staff is always friendly and they will modify dishes if you request it.",

Now onto my friends plates. The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together. The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous. I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football. Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder?

If nothing else, I go fairly frequently for the sandwiches, made fresh. Their Italian sub is an actual Italian sandwich, not an imposter like you would find at sub shops. My favorite is the Otto, which is a fully loaded Italian sub with extra meat and peppers. nnThe other is that I received sub par service recently and it disappointed me. nnI normally go to the Regent St location, as it is closer to my home and work. This time I was at the Monona drive location picking up some sandwiches for dinner. It was maybe 20 minutes before closing. nnWhen I got home, the sandwiches were different that what we ordered. By this time they were closed, so I called the next day. When I called, they offered to refund the price difference between what I paid for and what I received, but that was it. At the end of the day I still paid for something that was not what I ordered. I spoke to multiple people including the manager, but not the owner, who I have done business with in the past and I would speak highly of. nnOther than for this experiece I would be leaving a five star review.",

Put in our orders for two burgers (his with fries, mine fruit--I do like the option of getting fruit with my burger) within minutes of sitting down. However, it took 20 minutes to get our food. The place was NOT busy. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar, where we were seated. nnAbout 5 minutes after getting our food, my fiance let them know that he would like more fries. We finished eating, and waited for the fries. And waited for fries. And waited for fries. 20 minutes we sat there and waited. They continually told us \"They'll be up soon\" and \"Your fries are on the way\". I did make a point to communicate with the waitress that I needed to get back to work, and continually asked how much longer it would be, and eventually asked if we could get them in a to-go box because I was already late to work. However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs. This is for LUNCH TIME. Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer. nnIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries. I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting. I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. nnPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited. Ridiculous. Left the bar paying $7 for a small cheeseburger and still feeling incredibly hungry, ripped off and PISSED.",

The quesadilla was a total mess, stuffed to the brim with a slurpy cheese mixture. The filling was incredibly uneven - one triangle had cheese with just a hint of spinach, another was filled entirely with the spinach mixture (which I am 99% sure is just their spinach dip repurposed), and another had a surprising number of cold, mealy tomato cubes. nnPer the usual, my dad ordered a small cup of soup, and the server barely hid her disdain at our tiny order.

The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. nnThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. nnAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date.

I love the hits from when I was in school. (Although I wish the DJ would play less Prince and Michael Jackson and give some other artists their due. ) nnFriday and Saturday nights are great nights to dance stupidly (yet enthusiastically) with your friends to 80s music. Thursday nights used to be New Wave nights, which were fun for the goth and goth-wannabe crowds -- just remember to wear black that night! -- now Thursdays are apparently reserved for Hip Hop nights. I'm not sure how \"80s\" hip hop is, but whatever. nnThe Breakfast Club is perfect for birthday parties, girls nights out, etc.. .. for those of us in our 30s and 40s who don't go out every week like we used to, but still like to let loose once or twice a year.

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom. nnStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out. nnBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9. 95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel. nnMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer. Price would be close to a wash and convenience would be better.",

After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance. nnAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began. After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs. By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well. I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate. I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did. After wards i made a quick exit. nnThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here. I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least. Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment. A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation. It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me. On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you. nnYou've  been warned. nnJay",

Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. nnThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge.

From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount. nnSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers. nnWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \"Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check! ). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. nnSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help. nnAnd what's a cake without icing?

Dark paneling on the walls, dark ceiling, very low lighting, waiters and waitress's wearing white aprons, that sort of feeling. A nice lil old lady waited on us. We went about dinner time, though there was a snow storm that afternoon the place was pretty much empty so we were served quickly. nnOf course we both ordered different burgers with home fries. The burgers were of a nice portion. I got the Cajun burger with some greasy home fries. It was good but honestly, why I gave it a 3 stars was that there is really nothing spectacular about the burger or place in my opinion. It was good but not great. I don't think I'd drive from miles around to quench my burger needs here. I can see this place being a nice lil place to visit from time to time if you live in the neighborhood though. I definitely would go and check the place out if you've never been there before just to say you where there. nnHappy eatings my fellow Yelpers! nYour's Truely, The Shaw.. .",

My mind wasn't blown, nor was I disappointed. I think all thai restaurants need to unite and decide on a single \"heat scale\" to rule them all. Some places it's 1-5, some 1-10, and I've even seen a 1-7 thrown in here and there. The problem is, they are all subjective to the cook. nnI ordered a 7 out of 10 and got back something milder than mild buffalo wing hot.

Also, the nachos were truly a work of art.

I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. nnThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet! nnA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night.",

Sometimes it can get pretty loud. nnHowever, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine. nnI've tried three entrees: nn1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pastann2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for menn3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had.

There was also a perfect dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not loved it. This stuff, I loved. It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. nnThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going.

I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table. Of course we picked the one that didn't work! Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN. Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy. Plain old regular ESPN. Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers. Thats fine. But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game. SERIOUSLY. I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. nnThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness. The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad. nnPlus, beer was 4. 75! Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot. Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears. Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner. Took them long enough. nnIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea. Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.",

I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure.

He asked if he could write it up for puchase, I said no, we were just starting our search and wanted to see what was out there. We then asked him about the men's rings, and pointed us over to men's, not showing us or giving us information on rings. So we were back on our own. nnWe spent a few moments looking at the men's wedding bands when we were approached by another sales person, but we turned them away just saying we were looking. Shortly after, another lady comes over. Kevin didn't want the help, but I asked her anyways. Amber was a huge delight. She showed us the different kinds of rings and tolds us the different information on the rings. She asked us if we wanted her to write down the information on a card so we would know which ones we were interested in. She even went back to mine to write that down, and showed me another ring she thought would match, and it did, better than the one Gary showed us! She was happy to help us and very friendly, even though we were just looking. She was really the one that helped us moving forward and knowing what we wanted to look for at all the other stores. nnOne star for Gary and five for Amber. We are not going to go back to purchase because we found ones that we loved more at another store and that were more for our budget.",

It's a big venue for a coffee shop, with a down stairs area with beautiful exposed brick and large opening windows that are great in the summer months, and also an upstairs area with many tables, a fireplace with sofas, and even a back private room people can rent out. The coffee and pastries have always been pretty good. One complaint I would have is (I don't know if they still do this) you could only have Wifi access for two hours with the purchase of an item. I understand the need for this, but if you plan to work here for most of the day you have to keep refilling or buying other items on the menu.

Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish. Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives. nnThis place does it all. J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed. I started with some hot sake and a green salad. Their ginger dressing is delish! I was practically licking the bowl. I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came. J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

The French Onion soup was a bit salty and the mayo for the sandwich seemed warm. I tried the fries which were good but a bit too greasy for my taste. nnMy friend's Greek salad however was very tasty. It had a great mixture of greens, feta cheese and even potatoes! nnThe staff was nice and the prices were good. nnA place I would go back to but not regularly. Maybe try a happy hour there?",

Even when I finally made it to the top of the slides, the experience itself was mediocre at best.The staff members showed little enthusiasm and indifference towards guests. Their lack of engagement reflected in the overall atmosphere, creating an unwelcoming environment. Additionally, the food options were limited and overpriced, leaving me unsatisfied.One of the biggest disappointments was the lack of shade and seating areas throughout the park. Finding a spot to relax and escape the sun was a challenge, and the few available areas were packed and uncomfortable. This significantly impacted my overall enjoyment and comfort during the visit.Moreover, the restroom facilities were poorly maintained and unclean. Given the high number of visitors, it was disheartening to see such negligence in this aspect. The unsatisfactory condition of the facilities made for an unpleasant experience and detracted from the overall enjoyment of the park.On a positive note, the wave pool was one of the park's few redeeming features. The waves provided an enjoyable respite from the disappointment of the other attractions. However, even the wave pool lacked proper supervision, with an insufficient number of lifeguards present, raising safety concerns.In conclusion, Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh fell short of expectations.",

The layout, the merchandise displays, and even the color scheme mirrored every other Home Depot I've explored. While some may find solace in this consistent design, I couldn't shake the feeling of déjà vu.Initially, the store seemed well-stocked, boasting row upon row of tools, appliances, and construction materials. However, upon closer examination, I noticed a lack of variety in their selection. It felt as though I had encountered these exact same products on numerous occasions. I understand the need for uniformity in a chain store, but the absence of uniqueness left much to be desired.My disappointment didn't end there—the customer service was underwhelming. The staff displayed indifference and disinterest in assisting customers. I struggled to find a willing associate to address my inquiries, and when I finally did, their knowledge seemed limited, accompanied by an unenthusiastic attitude. This stark contrast to the personalized guidance one would expect for home improvement projects left me unsatisfied.On a positive note, the prices at this Home Depot were competitive. I managed to find a few reasonably priced items, particularly during their seasonal sales. Nevertheless, the overall experience felt lacking, as if the focus was solely on the transaction rather than creating a welcoming and enjoyable shopping environment.One redeeming factor was the store's cleanliness. Despite the lackluster atmosphere, the aisles were impeccably organized, with an abundance of staff members dedicated to maintaining tidiness. I appreciated the effort put into ensuring the store remained presentable, even if it couldn't compensate for the overall lack of excitement.",

        "text": "I wholeheartedly agree with another commenter's advice: avoid pre-paying at all costs. While the convenience of paying upfront for a product or service may tempt you, it often puts you in a vulnerable position, entirely dependent on the provider. Time and again, I've witnessed pre-payment leading to disappointment and frustration.One of the primary reasons to steer clear of pre-paying is that it relinquishes your ability to hold the provider accountable. Once they have your money, there's little incentive for them to prioritize your needs or fulfill their promises. It's always wiser to maintain some leverage by making payment contingent upon satisfactory results.Moreover, pre-paying can be financially risky. Circumstances change, businesses may go under, and unforeseen events can derail plans. If you've already paid in full, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover your hard-earned money. Protecting your financial interests should always be a priority.Another downside of pre-paying is its impact on flexibility. Life is unpredictable, often requiring us to make adjustments to our plans. By pre-paying, you lock yourself into a specific arrangement, with little room for changes or cancellations without potentially losing money. Opting for payment upon completion or after receiving the product allows for greater adaptability.Furthermore, pre-paying can result in a diminished level of service. Providers may feel less obligated to go the extra mile or provide top-notch assistance once they have received full payment. In many cases, the quality of service tends to decline once the transaction is complete, leaving you dissatisfied and feeling taken advantage of.Additionally, pre-paying can make it challenging to address any issues that may arise. If you've already paid and subsequently discover defects, problems, or discrepancies, resolving these matters can become a daunting task.In conclusion, I strongly advise against pre-paying.",

Initially, the plot seemed promising, but the execution left much to be desired. The pacing was inconsistent, with some scenes dragging on and others feeling rushed and underdeveloped.Furthermore, the character development was lacking. The protagonist felt one-dimensional, making it difficult to empathize with their journey. The supporting cast had potential, but they were severely underutilized, resulting in missed opportunities to explore their stories and motivations.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was decent, showcasing breathtaking visuals in certain sequences. However, the editing was choppy, making it hard to follow the narrative at times. Additionally, the sound mixing was imbalanced, with the dialogue often getting drowned out by the overpowering background score.The film's attempt at incorporating humor fell flat as well. The jokes felt forced and failed to elicit genuine laughter. It seemed like the comedic relief was added hastily, without much thought to its integration within the overall tone of the film.On the positive side, the production design was impressive, effectively capturing the essence of the story's setting. The costumes and set pieces were meticulously crafted, enhancing the visual appeal of the movie. The soundtrack, although overshadowed by the flawed sound mixing, had a few standout tracks that added depth to certain scenes.Despite its shortcomings, the movie did manage to deliver some captivating action sequences. The choreography and special effects were commendable, providing thrilling and visually engaging moments that momentarily grabbed my attention.It's worth noting that the film did touch upon relevant societal issues. It attempted to address thought-provoking themes, tackling subjects such as identity and the consequences of unchecked power.",

Stepping through the doors, a wave of nostalgia washed over me as I took in the familiar blue and white color scheme, evoking childhood memories of shopping trips. However, as I delved deeper into the store, it became clear that Kmart was struggling to keep pace with the evolving times.What was once a bustling emporium now appeared deserted, with sparsely populated aisles and shelves showcasing a limited range of products. Kmart seemed to have lost its competitive edge, unable to match the convenience offered by online retailers and larger chain stores. Outdated displays and a cramped layout testified to the lack of modernization, making navigation through the cluttered sections a daunting task.The disinterested and uninspired demeanor of the staff further contributed to the lackluster shopping experience.

The inconsistency can be quite frustrating since I never know what to anticipate. On those fortunate visits, the food is meticulously prepared, bursting with delectable flavors that make my taste buds dance in delight. The presentation is flawless, and the attentive staff ensures an unforgettable dining venture. Unfortunately, there have been occasions when the food falls short of expectations. It lacks proper seasoning, and the dishes feel hurriedly assembled. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is pleasant, adorned with stylish decor and comfortable seating. However, the noise level can become excessively loud during peak hours, hindering conversation. The menu offers an extensive array of options, catering to diverse tastes and dietary preferences. Vegans and vegetarians will find a satisfactory selection, but some dishes lack innovation. The prices are reasonable considering the quality of food offered, although the portion sizes can be inconsistent. On one visit, you may receive a generous serving, while on another, you might be disappointed by a meager portion. The dessert menu is a standout, boasting decadent treats that are worth leaving room for. The wait staff is generally friendly, although service can be slow during busy periods. Overall, this place has the potential to be exceptional, but the hit-or-miss nature of the experience makes it difficult to wholeheartedly recommend.",

The churros were warm and crispy on the outside, with a melt-in-your-mouth interior. They were generously coated with cinnamon sugar and served with a luscious chocolate dipping sauce, truly indulging my taste buds.Throughout the evening, the attentive staff consistently checked in with me to ensure that everything was to my liking.

It showcased vibrant colors and promised exceptional quality, but the reality was far from it. Once I opened the box, I was met with a poorly constructed product that seemed rushed in its assembly. The materials used felt cheap and flimsy, lacking the durability I was hoping for.To make matters worse, the performance was absolutely abysmal. Despite the manufacturer's claims of outstanding speed and efficiency, the product consistently lagged and struggled to accomplish even the simplest tasks. Its slow performance was not just frustrating; it made the product practically useless for any demanding work or entertainment purposes. Even the user interface was a disaster. The menus were clunky, and the navigation was confusing, adding to the overall frustration and underwhelming experience.As if these issues weren't enough, the customer support was utterly unresponsive and unhelpful. Trying to address my concerns became an impossible task. This product is a clear example of false advertising and a complete waste of hard-earned money.

From the moment I stepped into their store, their lack of professionalism was glaringly obvious. The staff appeared disinterested and unhelpful, clearly indicating that customer satisfaction was not their priority.The range of tuxedos available was extremely limited, and the few they did have were outdated and in deplorable condition. It felt as though they hadn't updated their inventory in years. The fitting process was a complete nightmare. The staff failed to take accurate measurements, resulting in a tuxedo that fit poorly and looked awkward and uncomfortable.To add insult to injury, the tuxedo they provided was dirty and adorned with noticeable stains. It seemed as if they hadn't bothered to clean it before renting it out. When I brought this issue to their attention, they displayed a disconcerting indifference and provided no solution or apology.To exacerbate matters, the tuxedo began to unravel during the event itself. The buttons were loose, and the seams were coming undone. It was an embarrassing spectacle that ruined the entire evening for me. I never anticipated a rental service to provide such substandard attire.Furthermore, the pricing they charged was exorbitant considering the abysmal quality they delivered. I could have obtained a far superior tuxedo from another establishment at a lower price. It is evident that this rental service capitalizes on its customers by charging exorbitant rates for subpar products.The customer service was equally horrendous. When I called to express my dissatisfaction and request a refund, I encountered rude and unhelpful representatives. They adamantly refused to acknowledge their mistakes or assume any responsibility for the dreadful experience I had endured.In conclusion, I strongly discourage anyone from utilizing this tuxedo rental service.",

With great anticipation, I looked forward to my dinner at this renowned teppanyaki restaurant, based on the rave reviews I had received from friends and colleagues. However, I left feeling immensely disappointed and frustrated.To begin with, the service was shockingly slow and inattentive. Despite having made a reservation well in advance, my party and I endured a nearly 30-minute wait before being seated. The hostess appeared overwhelmed and disorganized, clearly lacking the necessary skills to efficiently manage the seating arrangements.Once we were finally seated, we eagerly awaited the arrival of our chef to begin the preparation of our meal. Unfortunately, it took an incredibly long time for anyone to acknowledge our presence. The lack of communication from the staff only added to our growing frustration, as our hunger intensified with every passing minute.When the chef eventually arrived, his lackluster performance further dampened our spirits. He displayed no enthusiasm or interest, merely going through the motions without the flair and showmanship we had come to expect from a teppanyaki chef. The food itself was mediocre at best, lacking depth in flavor and featuring subpar ingredients.Moreover, the once vibrant and lively atmosphere of the restaurant felt strangely dull that night. The background music was barely audible, and the absence of cheerful chatter and laughter created a somber ambiance. It felt as though the soul of the restaurant had taken an unwelcome hiatus.As the evening progressed, we found ourselves constantly vying for the attention of the waitstaff, who seemed more engrossed in their own conversations than in attending to the needs of the diners. Our requests for additional condiments and refills were met with indifference, leaving us feeling neglected and disheartened.",

And boy, did this iconic Pittsburgh institution deliver! The moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by an irresistible aroma of sizzling meats and freshly baked bread. The restaurant was abuzz with a lively atmosphere, bustling with both locals and tourists, creating an infectious energy that heightened our overall dining experience.Primanti Bros undoubtedly caters to carnivorous cravings. Their menu boasts an extensive selection of sandwiches, piled high with generous servings of meat, cheese, and coleslaw, making it challenging to decide where to begin. I personally went for their \"Almost Famous\" sandwich, a classic choice consisting of thick pastrami cuts, melted Swiss cheese, and a hearty portion of their signature coleslaw, all snugly enveloped between soft slices of Italian bread. Each bite offered a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, with the coleslaw's tanginess perfectly complementing the richness of the savory pastrami.What truly sets Primanti Bros apart from other sandwich establishments is their ingenious addition of fries directly inside the sandwich. This unconventional twist introduces an extra layer of indulgence and imparts a satisfying crunch to every mouthful. The fries were flawlessly cooked, golden and crispy on the outside while maintaining a delightful tenderness within. It's a blissfully messy experience that you quickly get the hang of, and trust me, it's worth every napkin you go through.In addition to their renowned sandwiches, Primanti Bros also offers a wide variety of other dishes that cater to diverse cravings. Our table thoroughly enjoyed their scrumptious loaded nachos, generously topped with a melty cheese blend, tangy jalapeños, and a generous serving of their homemade chili. The combination of flavors was simply fantastic and made for an excellent shared appetizer.",

Prices are higher than at other grocery stores in the area.The floors are often dirty, the shelves are dusty, and the bathrooms are not always clean. Employees have been seen handling food without gloves.Despite the friendly and helpful staff, these issues make it difficult to continue shopping at Sentry. Hopefully, the store can turn things around.",

The young lady who delivered our food wasn't particularly friendly and seemed inconvenienced by the task. While it's understandable, if this is the service offered, it shouldn't be provided.Despite this, the food was exceptional. Every dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked to order. My father especially enjoyed the chicken parmesan, declaring it the best he's ever had. I couldn't choose a favorite because everything was delicious!The restaurant itself is quite small, so I wouldn't recommend it for large dine-in groups.

They spent a considerable amount of time reading all the informational panels and observing the dinosaurs' motions. The science gallery enabled many hands-on experiments that maintained everyone's engagement. One exhibit allowed us to create circuits to light up different colored light bulbs.

The IMAX theater was showing a new documentary about national parks, providing beautiful scenery on their enormous three-story screen. After the movie, we checked out the 4D motion theater with its wind and water special effects. For lunch, we ate in the cafeteria while looking out over the plaza. In the afternoon, we visited the art studio where children were doing craft projects. The body works area helped us learn about human anatomy through models and interactive displays. By the end of the day, we were tired but had thoroughly enjoyed exploring all that Discovery Place had to offer. I would definitely recommend spending a weekday there, if possible, to avoid large crowds, making for a fun and educational family outing.",

The knowledgeable staff skillfully piqued the children's curiosity and made learning fun through hands-on demonstrations and games. I spent over an hour enjoying the museum playground, eagerly climbing structures and playing with other kids. It was fascinating to observe the younger children's imaginations come alive as they enacted different scenarios. By day's end, all the children were tired yet happily animated, brimming with exciting stories to share with their parents about their discoveries. This museum does an excellent job sparking students' curiosity and fueling their enthusiasm for exploring the mysteries of science.",

I was able to delve more deeply into topics that particularly interest me. The guest speakers demonstrated impressive expertise and provided insightful perspectives. All attendees I encountered were friendly and excited to discuss our shared interests in depth. I left feeling inspired with numerous new ideas and information to reflect on. One aspect I appreciate is previewing upcoming books, games, films and television shows on the horizon. It's always thrilling to catch a glimpse of what's to come in favorite genres. This year's venue was even more suitable than last, with ample room to spread out between events and many comfortable areas for relaxation. The food options also improved notably since last year's convention. I didn't feel quite as overwhelmed by the significant crowds as before. Overall, it was an extremely well-organized event that I feel offered great value. I'll absolutely aim to attend again next year if my schedule permits.

Most options represent tired American standards available anywhere. Little imagination went into crafting flavorful combinations or intriguing presentations. Adventurous diners looking for innovative cooking will feel let down.  Upon seating, it took over fifteen minutes to receive drink orders, an unacceptable delay. When our server did arrive, she appeared overwhelmed and distracted. She neglected to enter one of our appetizer orders entirely. The kitchen also struggled, as main dishes took over an hour to deliver, an excessive wait.Bland and overcooked best describe most meals served. Even simple dishes like chicken tenders suffered from careless preparation. Sides lacked luster at best, leaving no impression at worst. The sole redeeming feature was a seasonal salad, though not substantial enough to rescue the meal.At the prices charged, customers rightly expect higher quality food and service. Yet this restaurant delivers neither, seeming indifferent to the dining experience. With so many delectable options nearby, little reason exists to waste time or money here. Save your appetite and dollars for one of the numerous superior choices in this vibrant city center.  In summary, this establishment offers mediocre fare amid abundant excellent alternatives in uptown Charlotte. Diners hoping for a noteworthy meal would do well to look elsewhere.

Though sparsely decorated, the dining room exuded a relaxing ambiance that set the tone for an enjoyable meal. After some time perusing the thoughtfully crafted menu featuring both traditional Japanese fare and innovative fusion dishes, I decided to start with the karaage fried chicken and silky miso soup. Both appetizers exceeded expectations - the chicken had a sublimely crispy exterior encasing moist meat within, while the soup balanced a rich, nuanced broth perfectly. My main entree of wagyu beef served sizzling in a hot stone bowl was truly a feast for the senses. Tender cuts of the premium wagyu were complemented beautifully by a seasonal assortment of fresh vegetables. The beef simply melted in my mouth. Alongside came steamed rice and a locally crafted beer, both complementing the outstanding flavors on display.Throughout the meal, each dish was presented with an artistic flair that underscored the kitchen's passion and skills. While the journey across town had been longer than anticipated, every flavorful bite reinforced that Fujo was well worth discovering. The attentive service further enhanced the dining experience.

The cafe provides a calming space to enjoy coffee or tea while absorbing a story. Staff members are generally quite knowledgeable and happy to provide recommendations. Checkout tends to be swift so patrons need not wait long. Prices compare favorably against other book retailers. Although I now do most shopping online, visiting Barnes & Noble allows exploring shelves in person.Their Nook e-readers present decent budget-friendly options. The loyalty program nicely rewards patrons with future discounts. Customer service has proven helpful whenever guidance finding an item was needed. Freestanding locations typically have convenient parking. Sales and promotions regularly entice returns to discover deals.

Wilmington International Airport (ILM) in Wilmington, North Carolina is a medium-sized hub that services the Wilmington metropolitan area with approximately 300 weekly flights. The airport has two asphalt runways and a single terminal building containing five gates. Major carriers like American, Delta, and United operate at ILM, providing connections to hubs in Charlotte, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. I also stopped at Florence Regional Airport (FLO) in Florence, South Carolina. FLO primarily handles regional flights on carriers such as American Eagle, serving the smaller communities in the area. The airport features one runway and a compact terminal. Neighboring airports such as Myrtle Beach International and Raleigh-Durham International showcase significantly larger operations by comparison. Both ILM and FLO offer convenient air access for their respective local populations, though flight options and destinations are more limited than at major transportation hubs. In summary, these regional airports provide reliable aviation options for intra-regional travel throughout the southeast, serving the transportation needs of travelers across the Carolinas.",

Since no clear rules were posted, it felt like the shuttles arbitrarily chose who to assist. As visitors unfamiliar with the area, we relied on the touted shuttle to get around. It is misleading to advertise a benefit without properly explaining limitations. I wish they had been upfront that the radius was small and exceptions rarely granted.

The small bathroom had a weak showerhead that offered low water pressure. Additionally, the air conditioning unit was loud and audible throughout the room. The hotel parking garage left much to be desired as well, with cramped spaces that were difficult to navigate. Parking rates were also rather high for the area. The front desk staff were pleasant enough but did not seem very knowledgeable when answering questions, often having to check with managers. Breakfast options lacked variety and the food quality was mediocre at best. The sole benefit was the location near restaurants and shops. However, for the price paid, I expect significantly higher standards of cleanliness and amenities. Moving forward, I will be more selective about which Omnis properties I patronize.

On multiple occasions, I've wasted hours on hold being bounced between departments with no end in sight. Their customer service motto may as well be \"leave the customer hanging as long as possible without any real assistance.\" Not only is their customer service deficient, but their internet and cable services are also subpar and unreliable. I experience outages and connectivity issues weekly, yet they refuse to acknowledge potential infrastructure problems on their end. At this point, I've lost count of the unfulfilled service calls and missed appointments. It is evident Time Warner Cable prioritizes collecting extra fees over keeping customers satisfied.

The on-hold song loops every 2 minutes and 43 seconds, according to my count. At this point, after so much time wasted without resolution, I am at my wit's end and contemplating hanging up altogether. Dealing with Time Warner's automated phone system proves fruitless, as it never seems to understand my inputted responses clearly. Reaching an actual representative feels nearly impossible. As a major provider, shouldn't customer satisfaction be a top priority? Undoubtedly, others must share similar complaints about these unacceptable hold times and unhelpful automated processes. It's no wonder TWC is likely hemorrhaging customers. If my issue isn't resolved soon, I will have no choice but to switch providers to avoid further aggravation.This ordeal has now dragged on without solution for 3 days - an unacceptably long time for a relatively simple matter. At this stage, I am strongly considering drafting a formal grievance letter to TWC leadership to express how poor this customer experience has been. In total between these last two days, I've wasted over 2 hours stuck on hold - far too much time spent trying to accomplish what should take minutes.

During one lunch break, we ate at the on-site restaurant located within the water park itself - a convenient choice allowing our group to dine together.

An abundance of natural light floods the expansive concourses through large windows. Trees and other plant life are strategically placed throughout, imbuing the interior with a near park-like atmosphere at times. The public art program has featured works from many local Pacific Northwest artists, offering colorful insights into the region. Quality local coffee and snack vendors ensure hungry and weary travelers feel satisfied. Even the passage between terminals is agreeable, following an underground walkway incorporating additional natural elements into the design. Signage proves clear and intuitive, helping passengers efficiently navigate to their destinations. Security lines normally move swiftly thanks to numerous open checkpoints. Once airside, people watching provides amusement from windows facing the tarmac, viewing the diverse planes on taxiways and runways. On nice days, the majestic Mount Rainier is often visible in the distance, beautifully framed on the horizon. I've never encountered a truly poor travel experience departing from or connecting through Seattle-Tacoma Airport. It merits high marks in customer satisfaction and quality surveys for mid-sized airports. Even smaller regional carriers offer conveniences like power outlets at each seat. The airport skillfully balances comfort and functionality without sacrificing efficient purpose. Overall, Sea-Tac delivers a refreshingly laidback experience compared to other large hubs across the country.",

After years without a team, basketball fans in the city are excited to once again cheer for the buzzing Hornets. Led by young talents like Kemba Walker and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, this energetic roster is developing an entertaining style of play. While it may take time for the team to become playoff contenders, they display grit against top opponents and have flashed moments of brilliance. The Charlotte faithful have fully embraced their team again, turning home games into electric atmospheres at the Spectrum Center. Walker's progression as both the team's star and floor general will be fascinating to watch as he leads his developing teammates. This season marks a fresh start for hoops in Charlotte, gaining the support of a new generation of fans behind the Hornets. If the promising young core continues advancing together, the franchise appears poised to regain its championship contention. For now, fans simply delight in having the NBA and Hornets tradition restored to the Queen City, breathing new excitement into the community.",

Conversation can be challenging to hold amidst the crowds and hubbub. Navigating the large, busy concourses to one's gate is not always straightforward either. Security screenings can take quite a while during peak times, while restaurants and shops often have long lines. It is common to have to wait to get through checkout as seating is frequently in short supply, so one regularly finds themselves standing around. Despite the busyness, staff generally do an excellent job of getting people to where they need to go. For the most part, trips through the airport run fairly smoothly. While a busy airport is not ideal, it demonstrates the airport's popularity and heavy usage. The large number of flights and travelers means this airport serves as a major transportation hub. It is reassuring knowing there are ample flight options when it is time to head home. Though crowded, the variety of dining and retail helps pass the time. People watching the diverse mix of passengers was interesting. My sole complaint would be that WiFi can bog down sometimes due to high traffic volumes. Additional charging stations would also be beneficial. Ultimately, this airport reliably gets one to their destination, even if it is not always the most relaxing experience. With expansions and renovations underway, hopefully conditions will continue improving. However, its convenience and connections make dealing with the crowds worthwhile.",

Thin walls allowed noise to carry between rooms; we could hear other guests in the hall and adjoining rooms. The basic breakfast - cereal, toast, coffee - lacked variety but met basic needs. Situated about a 10-minute drive from downtown, the location offered acceptable convenience. However, with few nearby restaurants, driving was needed for dining out. Front desk staff greeted us cheerfully during check-in, though we had little other contact. It proved acceptable for an overnight stay but better options likely exist at a comparable rate, so we wouldn't return. Booking further in advance would have encouraged exploring alternatives first. Given its shortcomings, I'd assess it a middle-of-the-road 6 out of 10 overall.",

The gentleman I spoke with today looked on the verge of tears, clearly dreading each new customer that entered. He seemed burdened knowing more complaints were inevitable.

When I asked a simple question, he labored to find the answer online, moving at such a sluggish pace due to his despondency. Lengthy lines of irate patrons filled the store, lodging complaints about connection problems. It's no wonder morale has sunk so low with how regularly customers have been angrily lashing out. I overheard some truly rude individuals screaming right in the workers' faces, showing no compassion. Nobody seems to appreciate everything they withstand daily.

Restaurants and shops were likewise overwhelmed, with long queues at every outlet. Thankfully, most travelers maintained their composure, though the occasional disagreement did erupt. After what felt like an eternity, I finally reached security, which bore its own significant line. The TSA agents worked diligently, though, processing people as smoothly as circumstances allowed. Beyond security offered no respite, as all gates teemed with travelers. Locating an open seat proved challenging but I eventually spotted a spot on the floor near my gate. The stifling heat heightened tensions, leaving many warm and fatigued. By the time my flight commenced boarding, I desperately wanted the air conditioning of the plane. All told, it was an exhausting few hours in one of the busiest airports I've experienced. But I did ultimately arrive at my destination, which was the primary goal in the end.",

Customers spend far too long on hold waiting to speak to representatives who are unhelpful at best. It seems the company prioritizes ending calls quickly over actually assisting customers. The equipment is subpar—cable boxes and modems constantly need resetting or replacing. Upgrades and new installations take an unreasonably long time to complete, sometimes leaving people without service for weeks. Even routine maintenance often disrupts connectivity for hours or days without notification. Downloads rarely achieve the speeds we pay for, especially during peak hours. Outages, planned or not, are all too common. The website and bills are a confusing mess as well. It’s nearly impossible to get an accurate bill or make meaningful account changes online. Rates increase annually at an unjustifiable clip while options are limited in our area. At this point, any competitor would be better. I would switch immediately, regardless of cost, just to escape Time Warner Cable’s poor service and aging gear.Clearly, Time Warner Cable has fallen far behind industry leaders. Unless significant improvements are made soon, more will likely “cut the cord” or switch to newer options. Their negative reputation is earned after many frustrating personal experiences as a long-term customer. Decisive changes are needed to regain customer trust and satisfaction.",

Confirmation was instant, relieving worries about the time slot going missing. Upon arrival, the hostess promptly found my reservation thanks to OT's integrated information. Both service and fare exceeded expectations, but most appreciative was knowing little wait for a table. I'll happily pay OT's small fee per booking since it saves much time versus ringing restaurants directly. Recently while traveling out of town, OT also proved practical for last-minute dinner on short notice—just as smooth in another city. The ability to add diners and tweak last-minute through the app underscores its convenience. Email alerts notify me to fresh availabilities, allowing me to secure coveted reservations in the nick of time. Now all companions also use OT after witnessing its seamless process firsthand. Nice avoiding logistical stress, focusing instead on good cheer with friends and family over meals. OT has truly transformed how I experience eateries by removing typical irritation securing reservations entails.

Staff made genuine efforts to update us on progress, but communication was infrequent as the minutes turned to an hour. Finally, with a loud jolt, the restraints freed us to continue and complete our ride experience. In consolation, operators provided return tickets to enjoy another turn without the lengthy interruption.

The food was undeniably exceptional, with visually stunning dishes that burst with flavor. The menu offered a diverse selection of options, ranging from classic comfort foods to more adventurous choices, and the presentation of each dish was impressive, with attention paid to even the smallest details.However, the service fell short of our expectations. Our server seemed overwhelmed, taking a long time to take our order and even longer to bring our food. When we requested refills on our drinks, we were met with a sense of annoyance, as if it was an inconvenience for the server to accommodate our request.The ambience of the restaurant was also underwhelming. The dining area was small and cramped, with tables packed tightly together, giving it a fast-food-like atmosphere.

The prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. We also appreciated the option to customize our dishes, allowing us to tailor our meals to our specific tastes.In conclusion, while the service and ambience left much to be desired, the food at this restaurant was truly exceptional.

While the food was still good, the egg rolls were not as crispy as I'm used to, and the lo mein was a tad overcooked. It's possible that this was just an off night for the kitchen, but it was a bit disappointing nonetheless.One thing that's worth noting is that the portions seem to have gotten smaller over time. I remember when the egg rolls were huge and packed with vegetables and meat, but now they're a bit smaller and not as filling. That being said, the soup is still excellent – I always get the hot and sour soup, and it's always flavorful and satisfying.The ambiance at China Palace is also pleasant. The traditional Chinese decor and dim lighting create a cozy atmosphere that's perfect for a casual dinner or a date. And the prices are very reasonable, making it an excellent choice for a budget-friendly meal.Despite the minor issues, I would still highly recommend China Palace to my friends and family. It's a reliable choice for good Chinese food, and the friendly and attentive service makes it a pleasure to dine there. Just be aware that they don't take credit cards, so make sure to stop by the ATM before you arrive.Overall, China Palace is a great choice if you're in the mood for a quick and delicious Chinese meal. Just be prepared for smaller portions and no credit cards, and you'll be all set for a tasty and satisfying dining experience.",

While the quality of the pastries can be inconsistent, with some being overly sweet and others lacking flavor, the croissants are a definite highlight. Flaky and buttery, they boast a perfect balance of flavors. The cakes are visually impressive, but the frosting can be overly sweet and overpowering. The coffee is average, but it pairs well with the baked goods. The bakery's atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with comfortable seating and friendly staff. Prices are reasonable, in line with other bakeries in the area. Overall, Paddy Cake Bakery is a good option for those seeking a casual bakery experience, but not the best choice for those looking for high-quality pastries.",

A dose of fresh air and greenery can do wonders for my mental health. Recently, I discovered a hidden gem of a park just a short drive from the city center. It's a tranquil oasis perfect for a picnic or leisurely stroll. The park is surrounded by towering trees that block out most of the city noise, and the grounds are carefully maintained with lush grass and colorful flowers blooming throughout the year. There's even a small pond where you can feed the ducks or take a boat ride. It's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful retreat.",

The food was overpriced and underwhelming, with small portions that left me feeling unsatisfied and overcharged. The menu options were limited and uninspired, with nothing particularly unique or exciting. The quality of the ingredients was questionable, with bland flavors and unappetizing textures.The service was slow and unfriendly, with long wait times and forgetful bartenders. The ambiance was lacking, with uncomfortable seating and a cramped layout. The dim lighting and overall feeling of discomfort made for an uninviting atmosphere.I was looking forward to a nice night out, but this restaurant failed to provide it. I would not recommend it to anyone, and I will not be returning. It's a shame, as the location is convenient and the exterior appears promising. However, the interior is a letdown, with a lack of attention to detail and a general feeling of mediocrity.Overall, I would give this restaurant a solid 2 out of 5 stars. It's not worth the money or the time, and there are much better options in the area. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.\"Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* Changed \"I'm sorry\" to \"This restaurant failed to deliver on all fronts\" to make the review sound more professional and less personal.* Changed \"The food is overpriced and underwhelming\" to \"The food was overpriced and underwhelming\" to make the review sound more concise and cohesive.* Changed \"The service is slow and unfriendly\" to \"The service was slow and unfriendly\" to make the review sound more concise and cohesive.* Changed \"The ambiance is lacking, with uncomfortable seating and a cramped layout\" to \"The ambiance was lacking, with uncomfortable seating and a cramped layout\" to make the review sound more concise and cohesive.",

Both stores share a similar warehouse-style layout, offering a wide variety of bulk items, groceries, and electronics at competitive prices. However, BJ's stands out with its more organized and user-friendly store layout, making it easier to navigate and find what you need.One advantage of shopping at BJ's is their membership benefits. They offer various membership levels, including individual and family plans, as well as a business membership for small entrepreneurs. These memberships come with perks like discounts on select items, free shipping on online orders, and exclusive promotions.It's important to note that BJ's has a minimum purchase requirement for some items. While this can be inconvenient for those looking to buy only a few items, it's worth it if you're planning to buy in bulk. Plus, with the savings you'll enjoy as a member, you'll likely find that the minimum purchase requirement is easily met.In conclusion, BJ's Wholesale Club is a great option for anyone seeking a convenient and cost-effective way to buy bulk items and groceries. With a wide selection, competitive prices, and valuable membership benefits, BJ's is a smart choice. Just be prepared for a busy shopping experience, especially on weekends.Date: 2023-11-30",
