TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylarassures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and themetallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effecttransistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison.

The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation.

The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K isanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlatedwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10xless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness inthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radioloudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers thatdestroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. Weanalytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies withinSSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapidgalaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced rampressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 mergingclusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.",

Sound transmission is a non -broken test technology that is usually used to monitor the integrity of the structure and detect damage in various materials and components. However, accurately positioning multiple AE sources in real time is still a challenging task. The proposed method uses advanced signal processing technology and machine learning algorithm to locate multiple AE sources at the same time. The proposed methods include three main stages. First, the signal pre -processing is performed to improve the quality of the AE signal obtained and extract related functions. This pre -processing step aims to reduce noise and enhance the detection of a single AE event. Secondly, a new type of cluster algorithm is used to group similar AE events according to its space and time characteristics.

Finally, use a localized algorithm based on machine learning to estimate the space coordinates of each recognized AE source. In order to verify the proposed method, a wide range of experiments were conducted using the simulation environment with multiple AE sources. The results show that even if there is noise and overlapping signals, the proposed method can accurately locate multiple AE sources. The comparative analysis of the existing positioning technology further establishes the advantages of proposed methods, in terms of accuracy and robustness.

SSIPM aims to process the complex relationship between predictive variables and response variables by merging condition functions and single index structures. The use of the sample function can flexibly model the non -linear relationship, while the single index structure reduces the dimension and enhances the explanatoryness. SSIPM is based on the return of the semi -parameter, and the possibility of punishment is estimated to achieve effective model fitting. Use the models proposed by the simulation data from various fields (including finance and medical care) and the evaluation of the real world data set evaluation.

In addition, the flexibility of the model capture non -linear relationship provides valuable insights between the relationship between the predicted variable and the response variable.

Spitzer IRS provides a unique opportunity that can study AGN's medium -infrared emissions line, thereby providing valuable insights for the characteristics of the covered ring. An AGN sample with the SPITZER IRS spectrum is analyzed to measure the line ratio of key launch rays including [neiii]/[neii], [OIV]/[NEII] and [SIV]/[NEII]. These ratio are used for diagnosis to detect physical conditions and ionization mechanisms in the AGN narrow line area. Our analysis shows that the line ratio between the AGN samples has significant diversity, indicating the changes in the nature of the covered ring.

These nebulas are known to be a huge and extended structure in the distant universe. We used a very large telescope (VLT) powerful visible multi-object spectrometer (VIMOS) instrument to observe three Ly-Alpha Nebula, which captured high-resolution spectrum on the vast field of vision. By adopting long seam spectrals and overall field spectrum technology, we have obtained detailed information about the spatial distribution of the spatial distribution of Ly-Alpha launch, the speed dispersion body and the entire nebula. Our analysis reveals the complex structures in each Ly-Alpha nebula, including multiple peaks, filaments and extended launch areas. We discovered evidence of large-scale flowing and strong space changes in the width of the Ly-Alpha line, indicating that there is a high dynamic process in the nebula. These observations show that the Ly-Alpha Nebula may be feeded by the active Galaxy nucleus (AGN), and the galaxy-scale wind and star form a combination of activity to provide motivation. In addition, the LY-α nebula is expressed in space-related LY-α and [O iii] emitters, which means connection between the AGN activity tracked by the ion gas tracked by Ly-Alpha and the [O iii] launch. We also detected that Ly-Alpha's launch far exceeded the radio galaxy hosting AGN, which supports the Ly-Alpha Nebula that can have the same size in the range of hundreds of Kiloparsecs. Overall, our discovery provides valuable insights on the nature and origin of giant Ly-Alpha Nebula related to Z ~ 2.5 radio galaxies.",

The purpose of the study is to explore the structure and electronic characteristics of the Wigner crystal limited in a dimension, which is achieved by using the potential well structure. The author uses numerical simulation based on density function theory to reveal the complex interaction between electronic electronic interactions and limit effects. The results show that due to the strong correlation effect, the one -dimensional Wigner crystal shows a unique deformation structure. It is found that the deformation is produced by the interaction between limited potential and exclusion electron -electron interaction, which leads to the deformation of the lattice. It also analyzes the electronic characteristics of the deformed Wigner crystal, and reveals interesting features in the crystal structure, such as energy gaps and local electronic states. In addition, the article studies the effects of various parameters (such as point size and electronic density) on the deformation and electronic characteristics of Wigner crystals. Both the point size and electronic density strongly affect the deformation and energy spectrum of the crystal. In addition, the phase diagram is constructed to illustrate the functions of these parameters to illustrate the different states of the deformed Wigner crystal. The discovery of this study clarifies the behavior of Wigner crystals in low -dimensional systems, and provides valuable insights for the physics of strong related electronic systems. The insights obtained from this study help understand the foreign electronic phenomenon in the quantum point, and pave the road for potential applications in nano -level equipment and quantum computing.",

In this game, a player (proposal) got a sum of money and asked to separate it from another player (responder). The respondent can accept or refuse to offer. If the response is accepted, both players will get money based on the proposed department. If the respondent refuses, neither player will receive it. In this article, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of the last game game. We considered a group of players who repeatedly played games and used genetic algorithms to develop the strategies of proposals and responders. We found that the high degree of evolutionary strategy depends on the initial conditions of the population. For example, if the initial population is mainly composed of proposals who provide reasonable allocation of funds, the population will develop towards a more strategic development of cooperation. However, if the initial population is mainly composed of proposals who provide very unfair funds, the population will develop towards a more selfish strategy. Our results show that the evolution of behavior in ATUM games is a complex and dynamic process. The strategy of evolution depends not only on the return structure of the game, but also the initial conditions of the population.",

The overall X -ray characteristics of RBS1423 are similar to other radioactive measurement stars, but the weakness of the Cumpton hump is unusual.

The recent observation results, including structured jets and high magnetization, means that the jet launch mechanism may be more complicated than before. We have studied how the magnetic power of high magnetic neutron stars is consistent with the observation characteristics of GRB. Methods: We execute axis symmetry, magnetic loss power simulation, where the rapid rotation magnetic field is embedded in a star envelope. We systematically change the characteristics of the magnetic field (magnetic field strength and rotation cycle) and star envelope (density curve and rotation rate), to study the outflow characteristics. Results: Our simulation shows that the magnetic bubbles of magnetic -driven can indeed produce quasi -out of Lorenz factor of hundreds of thousands to hundreds of times. The outflow of the Lorenz factor increases with the strength of the magnetic field, and it will decrease with the increase of the rotation cycle of the magnetic field and the increase in the density of the star envelope. In addition, we find that the outflow is in line with the strong magnetic hoop stress, which is important for shaping the outflow structure.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals the formation of single-phase cubic spinel structures with the FD-3M space group. According to the Debye-SCHERRER formula, it is found that the average crystal stone size is 25 nm. The magnetized measurement value of the dependent field confirms the iron magnetic properties of the 1.2 EMU/G of 1.2 EMU/G under the room temperature. Temperature -dependent resistance measurement shows that due to strong electronic interaction and disease effects, the 120 K metal -insulator transition (MIT) behavior is attributed to the positioning of the charge carrier. The optical characteristics were studied through the UV-VIS diffusion reflection spectrum. It was found that the energy of the band was reduced from the 3.25 EV of the pure Zno to the 2.95 EV of the Zno NP mixed with 5 %, indicating that the visible light absorption was enhanced. The optical glowing (PL) spectrum shows a wide transmission belt in the visible area, which is attributed to the state of defects from the radiation reorganization of the electrons from the radiation reorganization of the conduction band. This study shows that the mixed Zno NP is a promising material for rotating and photoelectric applications.",

This may lead to unnatural contribution to Higgs quality. In this article, we propose a solution to the use of small -level structural problems in the use of emergency ultra -symmetrical regulations. The superior symmetry that appears is a new mechanism of superior symmetrical fracture, which depends on the dynamics of strong coupling and quantitative theory. In our model, the Messenger field is charged under a hidden quantitative group, and the regulations are strongly coupled on the Messenger Mass. The powerful dynamics of the hidden volume regulations have generated a large abnormal dimension to the Messenger field, thereby suppressing their quality. This allows us to solve the problem of small -level structure and obtain the quality of natural light.

Polyakov proposes a positive movement to the world table area, and the proportion of the proportional measurement as \\ \\ (exp (-S_P [X]) \\) is \\ (s_p \\) is the Polyakov action. However, when the string coupling becomes strong, the proposal encountered difficulties. This is because the index of the Polyakov movement becomes large on the large value of the string coupling, which makes the path integral unclear. One way to solve this problem is to use different actions for world watch theory. A particularly interesting alternative is the SIGMA model action, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the decisive factor on the world table. The Sigma model has many advantages than the Polyakov action. First of all, its definition is very good for all values of string coupling. Secondly, it is common, which means that it is unchanged under the changes in the measurement standards on the world table. Third, it is related to the theory of the string field, which is the disturbance method of the string theory. In this article, we will study the role of the SIGMA model in the limits of no tension. Obtain this limit by raising the string tension to zero. In this restriction, the role of the Sigma model is the theory of two -dimensional topology. We will show that the SIGMA model in the limits of tension is equivalent to a specific two -dimensional top topology theory, called the liouville theory. This equivalent will enable us to study the SIGMA model in the method of the Liouville theory.",

The preliminary results show that among some semi -filaments, the amplitude and power of the P mode oscillation may be reduced, and the cycle is still similar to the surrounding environment. This will show that the part of the P mode wave is absorbed instead of scattering. It is necessary to further analyze to improve signals to noise, and statistically characterize any modification in the large filament sample. Understanding how oscillations can be transmitted through half -filaments, it may have new restrictions on the filament structure and dynamic dynamic, which has an impact on the cell structure and heat transmission of half a month.",

Their detection can provide insights on the formation and evolution of the planet system. However, because its size is small and the distance is very far from the earth, it is very challenging to use the current telescope for imaging. Here, we have studied an alternative method for exchanging external symbols based on the order of light transmission. We have developed a theoretical model to predict the timing deviation caused by the external exponential sections, because its host planets will cross the host star. We show that the amplitude of these deviations can be included in the physical characteristics of the outer manifestation, including its quality, radius and rail parameters. We use numerical simulation containing an external transition planet system with a series of quality and track to test our model. We then try to restore the appearance characteristics by analyzing the simulated transit light curve. Our results show that for objects greater than 0.5 earth radius, using this technology can limit the quality of Exomoon within 50 %, and the radius is less than 20 %. We discuss the factors that determine the measurement accuracy, such as the size of the appearance, orbital separation, and the signal of the observation value noise.

We first introduced the concept of dark matter and its significance in understanding the large -scale structure of the universe. Then, we discussed the concept and its unique characteristics of the Pakistani compared with dark matter. Next, we deeply studied the opposite sex of the halo speed and its role in distinguishing between dark matter and heavy sons. We have proposed several observation and simulation studies, which are trying to measure the influence of the opposite sex and their differences between the peeling speed and the difference between the difference between the dark matter and the heavy child. We also discussed the challenges related to the opposite sex at the speed of measurement aura, including the difficulty of directly observing the dark matter and the limitations of the current simulation technology. In addition, we emphasize the future research direction and observation tasks. These directions and observation tasks can improve our understanding of this basic difference. Finally, we summarize the points discussed in the article, and emphasize that the measurement of the heterosexuality of the measuring halo speed is to better understand the nature of dark matter and the importance of the relationship between Baryons. Our research emphasizes the necessity of continuing research in this field to improve our understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe.",

Using various examples, we demonstrated how to use a droplet description to encode information about the geometric shape and topology of the BPS boundary in the IIB super gravity. We also discussed the relationship between other methods of liquid droplet description and understanding of BPS geometric shapes, such as research using supermint positioning and boundary state. In addition, we have studied the understanding of our understanding of the corresponding relationship between the AD/CFT in the theory and the nature of the black hole.

The Villamayor algorithm is a widely used method that is used to calculate the main decomposition of a single ideal in the polynomial ring.

Considering various factors, such as the number of variables, ideal levels, and coefficient matrices, we analyze the complexity of the algorithm in detail under exception. Our results show that the complexity of the algorithm may depend on these factors and may be very high in some cases. We also complicate the complexity of the Villamayor algorithm and the complexity of other algorithms used to calculate the main algorithm of a single ideal. It may be worse than other algorithms. Our discovery is of great significance for the choice of the main decomposition algorithm of calculating a single ideal in different circumstances.

We use Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera to conduct survey (ACS) observation values to study the characteristics of BS 90 and its surrounding environment. ACS data provides high -resolution imaging functions, allowing us to study the structure and color characteristics of the cluster in detail. We found that BS was 90 years old for about 200 million years, which made it a intermediate range between young people and elderly groups. The color scale of the cluster reveals a transparent red giant branch, which indicates that the cluster has evolved significantly since its establishment. We have also determined that there are many giant branches (AGB) stars, which may be the forefront of the star nebula. The spatial distribution of stars in BS 90 shows a concentrated distribution, indicating the cluster of dynamic evolution.

In other animals with similar anatomy, this requires the teeth to be replaced due to wear and tear.The team members said they can now begin testing this theory and others regarding the dinosaur's biology and behaviour.Follow Paul on Twitter.",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Willy Caballero, 35, has featured in the squad for Premier League and Champions League matches since 21 January.But Bravo was restored to the starting line-up for City's win against Hull last weekend.

Last week, Asda reported its worst quarterly performance on record.Sainsbury's saw sales fall 0.6% and Morrisons by 1.8%.Market researcher Nielsen, which has published industry data in the 12 weeks up to 13 August, found similar trends.It and Kantar noted that promotional sales had dropped, reflecting the big four supermarkets' move towards simpler pricing models and permanent price cuts.Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said the big four supermarkets were simplifying \"the overall customer offer in response to the growth of the discounters by lowering the level of promotions and reducing multi-buys, instead moving to permanent price cuts\".He added that the hot weather and success at Rio had helped boost overall supermarket sales.\"Brexit seems to have been replaced by an Olympic 'feel-good' factor among shoppers and there were more visits to buy food and drink in the last four weeks than this time last year.\"Nielsen said the strongest category performances were in soft drinks, with mineral water sales up by 18.5%. This was followed by frozen foods driven by ice-cream sales.Kantar said grocery price inflation remained negative, with a representative basket of goods 1.3% cheaper than it was last year.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,\" he said.Last month, a landslide at a rubbish dump in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killed at least 113 people.",

He also asked the undercover officer to procure more horns and send them to Hong Kong.Mr Wei, who was sharing a hotel room with Mr Li, later asked an undercover informant to take a fish and wildlife officer out for dinner and offer her money to help Mr Li, prosecutors said.Meanwhile, prosecutors say Mr Wang bought libation cups carved from rhino horn in the US and sent them to Mr Li in Hong Kong.Some believe drinking from intricately carved rhino horn cups brings good health, and the cups are highly prized by collectors, US authorities said.Native to Africa, the black rhinoceros is classified as a critically endangered species, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.But demand for rhino horns and the prices paid for them on the black market have soared in recent years, US prosecutors said.",

Like-for-like revenues rose 2.7%.Chief executive Jill McDonald said Halfords had gained market share in both motoring and cycling.\"Profit performance for the year was impacted by the weaker pound but our plans are well developed and I am confident this will be offset over time,\" she said.It is the last set of results to be presented by Ms McDonald before she joins Marks & Spencer as head of non-food in September.Chairman Dennis Millard said Ms McDonald was leaving a \"strong team and a clear direction to drive future growth\".Halfords said higher import costs had largely been responsible for the drop in profits.It said a late Easter knocked recent sales, revealing a 1.2% drop in like-for-like retail sales in the final three months of its financial year.Taking the 15 weeks to 28 April 2017, which includes Easter, it said like-for-like sales were 3.9% higher.Ms McDonald said the company was in a \"position of strength\" despite \"uncertainty\" about consumer spending due to rising inflation.Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the focus on premium cycling brands was working, buoyed by the fact Halfords expects growth in cycling of 3-5% per annum in the medium term.\"Looking ahead there are hopes that the retailer will actually benefit from the weak pound as more people stay in Britain for holidays.\"Staycations might help, as will the focus on higher value bikes.

All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

In mere hours, we will see ICBMs cascade from the sky like fallen angels cast from Heaven; once our silent protectors in the form of mutually assured destruction, now our doomsday much like the betrayal of the rebel angel Lucifer. Tonight, we will see explosions glimmer through the land like shooting stars. Tonight, we will see our families evaporate into smoke before our very eyes. Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life. Still, we stand strong in the face of complete and assured death, not because we are too weak to retaliate, but because we' re strong enough not to. Our chapter is at its end. The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end. Are we really so vain to believe that just because a nation dies, all of mankind must perish? Are we really so arrogant to trust in our ideal of equality that the whole world must die? We' ve made our answers clear to the world. We hope it resonates and echoes in a new era so that mankind may truly understand what the end of the world mean and consequences it carries, so that some day in the future, despots and maniacs may not threaten nuclear war with a mad grin, but with a solemn attitude of remembrance. Perhaps one day, we can see how childish we really were. Thank you and goodnight.",

I really do n' t know who enjoyed the meal more, the pigs and I probably equally squealed in delight. Regardless the most this man should be charged with is kidnapping. But even that is putting things to a stretch. Honestly the only crime he ever committed was having the same physical description as me. 6' 2, blonde, blue eyes, muscular build and a tendency to visit Tom' s tavern. I have only been twice and he was there both times. I mean it makes it so much easier when you find a nice scapegoat. Anyways looking at him I can tell that our protein sources are way different. He does n' t have the sharp incisors required to tear human flesh from the bone. That kind of sharpness does n' t come easy. I spent months filing my teeth down with a nail file. I had originally thought about using one of those metal files to expedite the matter nut I felt like it would n' t give me the precise control I needed. The finite precision where I can draw blood with the softest bite. The real question on my mind is how did they ever pin this guy with the murder? I understand that I probably have been eating out a bit too often and the local authorities need someone to pin the crimes on, but how do they even know a crime existed? I guess I am fortunate enough to get a first hand account of all the details. Dammit, I' m hungry and looking at the Asian prosecutor all I can think is I want some Chinese.",

A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

I can picture it, the skin peeled back, the muscles underneath clenching and unclenching. My parents had gotten me a sewing kit for my birthday, perhaps in the hope of focusing me on something productive. The needles I had kept, and the string. The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh. Blood pooled, like a stagnant well. But it smelled of power, and it fascinated me. I sat for a while, watching my work. Seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird. The beast' s eyes rolled in its head, endlessly. And I watched. Its death was of no great interest to me. The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did. When it was over I cleaned my tools, even then I had been tidy, systematic. The body I hid, deep in the woods. I visited it often, reminiscing, remembering. The surge of power I felt faded each day, and I wanted more. My dog had been my first. And as you know officer, it was not my last.",

Everyone began changing into the spirit animals they saw in their visions. Well, everyone except me, that is.

Some pitied me for not being able to experience the new freedom and strength that came with a new form. Others looked at me with revulsion, and considered me unworthy and unclean. One by one, as each one completed the transformation, they slipped into the night. The old lady shook her head at me and sighed, suggesting that perhaps I did n' t pray hard enough. Her eyes were filled with frustration and pity. Yes, I' ll try again next year; yes, I' ll bring a better offering; yes, I' ll pray more fervently; and all that stuff.

I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

Bill. Fucking Bill. Do you have any idea how hard it is to protect someone that has, very literally, no sense of self preservation?

Day in and day out, I have to prevent this man from accidentally killing himself, and to what end? He will no doubt die in no small part due to his own stupidity, and *of course* they will say it' s my fault. Hello, Hell! Here I come! If I did n' t enjoy being alive and \" free \" so much, at some point I would just let that cookie kill him. I have grown, in case you ca n' t tell, incredibly apathetic towards this man. As much as I wish I could be rid of him, here is where I have to stay. He remains my mortal binding, and when he is gone, I will only be dragged deeper down.

It' s strange, because I do get lonely, and I do long for a special someone. I just do n' t have time. Time it' s a strange thing- my shift crawls- The only time I feel alive is when I' m helping those in need. It was October 12th 2013, 12: 15 p. m, the thick fog blocked the sun and it was completely grey. It was by sheer chance that I saw him on the red rails of the bridge as I was patrolling through, I stopped abruptly, threw my lights on and I approached the man. White male, age roughly 30 years old. I approached him, and called, \" Sir, I' m here to help! \" He was a few feet away. He was dressed in black rags, his head scraped, and smelled like death. It was entirely unusual to see someone in this physical condition as bad as him. Rotting flesh- that' s the smell. I called out to him as traffic zoomed by, just missing my squad car, \" Sir, my name is Officer Heart! \" He replied, \" I know. \" His head still peering into the white abyss below. He turned to me, we locked eyes, and he said, \" I know who you are Heart. \" I was looking into my blue eyes, I observed the scar on his face - it was in the precise location where I got mine. His eyes were far more piercing than my own - they peered deeply into my soul. He said, \" I' ve been waiting for you. \" My hands felt ice cold - my hat flew off- the wind rushed through my hair - and i felt weightless. I struggled to breathe. Than I realized I was falling and right before impact - I realized - I was the jumper.",

Nevertheless, we had the runes translated ( a good thousand of them! ) and sent back home. Society immediately put them to good use. It was like we' d all been given plentiful amounts of magic. Our civilization prospered on our new-found powers, which made our lives sooo much easier. I now realize that we really should n' t have transmitted the information at all.

And new souls were quite... unpredictable. You did n' t like using them. The art of weaving new souls had been long lost. Nobody thought there ever would be need for more. 10 billion souls had been such a ridiculous amount to begin with, so to think that wouldn' t be enough was talk for lunatics, not for sensible ministry men. But humans had managed to surprise you all. Perhaps the celestial body they were on would give out before the limit would be reached. Perhaps there would be another asteroid. Perhaps there would be a new plague. More wars. But it was all just wishful thinking. The humans had shown tremendous capabilities to survive from things meant to be their doom. To your annoyance. Slicing souls into two, sometimes three or even four, pieces had become a sort of a sience experiment for you. Humans were always so excited when they got identical offsprings, so it had been a win win situation. Of course when you recycled the soul as one later on, you got some side effects, but they were still viable souls and it had given you more time. But now it was impossible to postpone the decision. You were out of tricks. It was excitement you felt rather than despair.

There is so much to do in this life, but everyone chooses to pretend as if they' re dead for eight hours a night, or day, or whenever, honestly. The time is irrelevant; sleep is inefficient. It is lazy. *But what about dreams? * they ask me. *Dreams are where you can live out a life you would n' t otherwise be able to live. Dreams are fascinating, terrifying, and inspiring. Dreams are where our imaginations are not constrained by the confines of reality -- they are where space and time are nonsensical, and you can have a banana for an uncle, but it would still make sense, because it' s a dream! * I admit, this dreaming thing is the most curious of all things to me. Reality is all that I know. I have walked from shore to shore, and swam from beach to beach. In the night time, I have raced the yellows in my Maserati, which I was able to purchase after my insight into stock and option trading -- something I professed over the course of a few nights. I have written sonnets to the sunset, and odes to the sunrise. I have been told that I am a true virtuoso at many musical crafts, but it is only because I do not waste time \" sleeping. \" But dream... That is something I' ve not done. To a man who has done everything, there is little mystery that I experience anymore. If sleep is the cousin of death, then is suicide the permanent form of a sleeping pill? I do wish to dream.

It was all much quieter than I expected. When we finally reached the city there was nothing to see except ruins, and they all look the same. The cities identity was gone. After a little while the debris was too much to drive through and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I always kept my rifle ready even when the others slung theirs over their backs. I was scared of ambushes. During training, we' d been told to stay aware. But I never figured out what I was meant to be aware of. If they shot me then that would be that. I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting? My father said it was about honor. About quelling the invaders, but I never believed that it was so simple. I wondered if they ever made it back to their home country, and if I would make it back to my home.",

No sunlight, the wind rustling against rocks and fresh air. Then I hear it. Steps on the old stone bridge connecting this tower to the other one. IT' S THAT BASTARD. I stand up and jump down onto the bridge. We make eye contact and he starts running back. The first time I saw him, he at least had the courage to face me. I charge at him. He runs to the second tower and I swing my giant maul at him, but miss as he climbs up the ladder. I can hear him killing 2 skeletons upstairs. Then he looks down and I look up. Our eyes meet once more. I AM ANGRY. Why? This is the part where he throws a fire bomb at my arms when I try to climb up on top. I jump. My fingers grab the edge. Boom, he burns them. But this does n' t stop me. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he' s always a real asshole. He ca n' t fight me fair, so what he does is always throws 5 stabs at me during the brief moment where I take my breath after landing. Until I blow him away with my maul. He runs to a stain of blood and picks it up. Retrieval. Now he ca n' t even land a hit, the whimpy little fucker that he is. All he does is jump around and block with his shield. But he ca n' t keep it up forever. The moment he exhausts himself, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain of what he once was. I jump down the tower and go back to mine. I lay down and watch the skies. I savor the moment of peace. But I know from experience that fucker will be back in 10 minutes to interrupt it. And for some reason the two skeletons on the other tower will be animated again.",

Or you can do something like this: > He shuffled around in the small hold of the plane until one of the instructors finally told him to \" please sit down, sir. \" He' d already chewed his nails down to the quick, so now he was tapping his fingers against his knee, adjusting the zipper on the jumpsuit, triple-checking the parachute; anything to keep his mind off the near future: plummeting head-first from thirty-thousand feet, with the ground rushing up and no protection except a flimsy sheet that might not even work. He never should have let Ellen talk him into going skydiving. Sure it might cure his fear of heights -- by reducing him to nothing more than a splatter of blood and guts on the pavement, a victim of faulty equipment.

The game continued, observed closely by the burglar. He sat in an armchair beside the family, his gun resting on his knee, eyes fixed on the board. Finally, after six hours of intense playing, the mother had brought her children and husband to bankruptcy and won the game. Houses and hotels were scattered across the board. A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar.

Small comfort by itself, but the boy had also promised Michigan that his father was quite wealthy and extremely generous towards the homeless. The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain. He quickly dozed off. -- - In the middle of a pleasant dream about dogs made of butter, Michigan awoke with a start. He glanced at the wall clock. 1: 17 AM. \" Well, slap me sideways and call me Joan Jett, \" he moaned. \" I appear to have done the unthinkable whilst I slept. \" As he laid back down to wallow in his latest foible, he heard a man' s voice from behind the sofa. \" This is unbeknownst to me! \", the man cried. \" And now it is beknownst. Also, I did the unthinkable, so I' d appreciate a towel, a deck of cards, and three Canadian toonies, \" replied Michigan. The man, who Michigan surmised to be the young boy' s father, performed an almost beautifully timed double take. \" What do you mean, you did the unthinkable? \" \" Sir. What, exactly, do you think I mean? \" Upon attempting to think of the unthinkable, the boy' s father immediately shut down, because I forgot to mention that everybody is robots in this story.",

You curled up on the planks as best you could, angling your body to fit, your furred hood cushioning your head. The darkness bleeds in around you, stains your hands. The darkness is green, the darkness is yellow, and then there is light. You lie there for a moment, breathing in the water' s edge, staring at your empty hands. Then you squeeze your eyes shut and stretch out your arms, twist in your legs, and then sit up and yawn into the bright air. This is a lacuna, a gap in your journey that will never be filled. You reach out across the water and scrabble your fingernails against the wood of the dock, pulling yourself in by gentle inches.

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

I knew he would n' t last - the most complex never did - but minutes together was better than a lifetime apart. Against the drab colours of reality he seemed so bright and vibrant, too perfect for this world. I cupped his cheek, his gaze resting on me with uncertainty and confusion.

Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall.

A prompt based on an Einstein quote regarding time relativity was the most obvious, receiving 300 upvotes and 40 stories involving time travel, and spaceships. By day 5, every story involved some mention of Hitler, immortality or Gods. By the time Monday rolled around, the mods decided to close the subreddit.

The Soviet Union has been working with the U. N. as an arbitrator between the European Powers and the A.

I closed my eyes and grabbed the cold steel on the 10 mm in my pocket. \" Four mags, forty bullets, \" I comforted myself. I looked up and saw a circle of glaring eyes as I pulled the trigger flush to my finger and stumbled around in a circle. I counted them. I tried to. There were hundreds upon hundreds. A flash of lightening illuminated the hordes. In the distances I saw a figure, a monster in the clouds. I felt a tear trickle down my face. They must have seen it too, becaue their attention was no longer on me. I held the gun deep in my mouth and squeezed. The void enveloped me. An infinite amount of time passed in less than a moment. \" Welcome, \" the face of God said. \" You see my dilemma now, do n' t you? \"",

The alcohol swab to prevent infection right before they stuck in the needle suddenly made sense. \" What is this place? \" She said nothing.

Pulling out her phone she got staggered by the amount of people who tried to contact her. After realizing that she got people worried she felt that heavy feeling of uneasiness. She made haste and ran out of the bar as quickly as she could. As she lunged for the door. The sunlight strook her very eyes and blinded her for a split second. Then she regained her consciousness while laying on a bed. For a minute she felt lost. But as she thought she was only sleeping she quickly zoned out and saw the sight of tall buildings and realized she was on top of one and on the edge of one. As she felt the air pass by her face. While the shouting from behind here started getting louder shouting \" Do n' t do it! \". She then realized she was really lost. Her heart began to pound and it all went crashing in. She was n' t brave enough to face what today has and what tomorrow brings. She closed her eyes and looked at the void of existence which at the moment did not hold her interest.

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated. Maybe something like \" What the fuck is wrong with you? \" *",

But when you do the wrong thing for the right reasons long enough, it seems you can justify anything. Six million people died with the first bomb. It was an improvised nuclear explosive, funded with money stolen from bank accounts across the globe. Money I personally oversaw the transfer of, a bomb I ordered the construction and detonation of, six million lives I took with my own ideas, such are the sins I will carry with me along this road. The resulting political turmoil will lead to my appointment to global anti-terrorism council, with complete support from every major government in the world. Under my direction, eventually my organization will gain total authority over every man, woman and child alive. The sheer technological and logistical costs will be unheard of in history. I will then use my power to administer a test to all humanity, and kill any who fail. 2. 3 billion people, of which over sixty percent will be completely innocent, their only crime to register a false positive. The remaining 40 will be the carriers of a long dormant virus that will, when awakened in my timeline, leadsm to the extinction of mankind.

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

Every night for the past few years he dreamt of this place, and every night he woke as he reached the cool shade of the apple tree. Tonight, however, he was allowed to touch the tree. He felt the rough bark, and could smell the apples that littered its branches. He reached up to grab one of the apples, to finally taste one of them when he heard a voice. \" I would n' t do that if I was you. \" Adam spun around. He had never encountered another person in the garden before. When he saw her, his jaw dropped. She was very obviously full human. She was of medium height, with long dark hair and green eyes. She approached with a steady confidence that made Adam uneasy. She reached out to pull his hand away from the tree, and as soon as her smooth skin brushed against his, Adam woke. He found himself completely nude in a patch of trees that he had never seen before. He slowly got up and started exploring, trying to figure out where he was. A fallen tree was blocking the path, and as he climbed over it he gasped. The tree from his dream was right in front of him.

We have all sacrificed more than we would wish. We have all lost family members in the struggle for freedom. We have lost our homes. We have lost our jobs. We have lost our entire way of life. Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III.

Its own green canopy reached higher into the sky than any other tree within the forest. He climbed its trunk and swung around on its branches. Sitting within the shade, the little boy ate of the tree' s apples. The tree was happy. Everyday, the little boy came to play with the tree and eat apples. Everyday the boy and the tree were happy. One day, the little boy did not come to play, saddening the great tree. Though, the next day, the boy did come! The tree was happy! Eventually, the boy' s visits grew less frequent and shorter. Then the boy stopped coming altogether. The tree felt dejected and hurt for it was great and definitely the largest there ever was. What was wrong? Does the boy hate me? Did he not actually enjoy playing with me? I thought he loved me. Years had passed and the boy finally returned. The tree greeted the boy and the boy returned the greeting. Then he asked for money. Money? The tree might as well give the boy all his apples it grew itself. So the tree gave the boy its apples... then its branches... then its trunk... The tree finally felt happy to release all that weight off it' s stump... and the boy? Well, he died from too much weight on his shoulders.",

I was tending my fields in earnest, reaping the budding corn shucks from the rich spring soil when I first saw her. She was standing with a deep, silent strength that was palpable even from a distance. Her body swayed in perfect rhythm with the surrounding breeze, as if neither had known life without the other. I approached her slowly, casually, as though my path were eternal and without exigency. There was no seduction in my heart, though I will now admit my flushed cheeks betrayed my trepidation - I was simply a farmer, reaping his harvest as he always did. I passed her with only a slight glance, the same look I would give any singular, sanguine beauty in a field of yellow wash. It was only when I heard the soft \" thuck \" of contact that I turned around. She had fallen, and my instinct told me it was no accident. I carefully walked back toward her, approaching with the gentle caution of one tending a wounded animal. As I came close, the noonday sun struck her rosy visage and she glowed with a dancing sparkle of crimson flame. Mesmerized yet undaunted, I reached down and picked her up. Her skin was flawless. The smooth, sensuous symmetry set my heart alight with passion. My entire being, my very soul felt as if it had expanded beyond its narrow confines. I was free. I was alive. I was *home*.

He had no idea what was about to happen. However, Jack was the Chosen One, and he had a responsibility to the world. When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white. Suddenly, the CEO was transfixed on Jack' s hands. Inside the CEO' s mind was pure madness. He saw his wife and kids burning, in the ruins of his childhood home. He could n' t hold back his tears. One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse. And his friends were crying... no, not crying. *Laughing. * He fell to his knees and wept. In the real world, however, nothing was to be seen but a grown man, leader of a company, sobbing uncontrollably for no reason. Jack decided to be creative this time. He made the illusion of Mickey mouse ears appear on each and every employee' s head. They were grafted on of course, and felt just like they were really there. The CEO was in for a nice surprise when he woke up. Jack used his powers to erase the minds of the executives around him, replacing thoughts of expenses and profits with the single-minded desire to give the CEO a hug. Jack giggled, not having to stifle his laughter anymore. He levitated out th window, crossing a name off his list. Jack was the Chosen One. His powers were unstoppable. He could be whatever he wanted. Obviously, whoever was doing the choosing made a mistake. That was clear to Jack, at least. Life was a role-playing game to him.

Nonetheless, my journey has brought me here to the largest geological structure to ever have graced the planet. I was n' t sure how far it reached or how long it would take to summit, but time was n' t a commodity anymore. What happens after I conquer this beast? Will there be more behemoths to slay? How much further must I go before I am consumed with the rest of the universe? I beg for the blackness to swallow me without spitting me out again. In this environment one does not need anything but his hands. Dug deep in the stone they are invaluable. Funny thing hands are when you really think about them. They are simply five extending tendrils, not much different than a sea creatures tentacles. But dear lord! Are they useful! And toes! My, how silly those little stubs are. They are capable of so much. So As the universe withers away, I too become like dust. Might as well climb.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony. It is our duty to the planet that bore our kind to be not only the last of humanity, but the best of humanity. No citizen of Mars may pass a law that contradicts the principles of unity and the betterment of humanity. **",

Ron Paul was n' t exactly a household name before, but by November 6th a whole lot of people knew who he was. Allegations of voting fraud shot across the country, but the Supreme Court soon ruled that more recounts would be excessive. Interest groups scrambled to account for this unforeseen event. AIPAC went into full gear when President Paul' s budget did not include aid to Israel, but the President held his ground and a majority of Congress cooperated. The NRA danced in the streets with their firearms. TEA Party activists, organizing via Facebook, quickly organized real-life reenactments of the Boston Tea Party, dumping shipping crates from China into the oceans to protest the \" trade imbalance. \" After America drastically withdrew it' s overseas actions, China soon began to compete with the US as the world' s military and political superpower. The UN became even more irrelevant as secret negotiations between China and the US decided more and more of the world' s fate. One day, negotiations could accomplish nothing more. China launched it' s nukes, and America responded in kind. The President lived out the rest of his life in a bunker under an isolated Wyoming mountain.",

There were no appointments I needed to show up for. It was the weekend, so I did n' t have to go to work. Odd. That' s when I noticed my Star Wars poster. The text was mirrored.

It was large and bulky, and camouflaged with a dark green tint. If that were me up there, I definitely would have had trouble holding that thing. Larry tapped my shoulder and held up three fingers. One finger fell, and we clung against the brick wall behind us, removing our shoes to reduce the amount of noise we would make. Two fingers down, and Larry and I removed our shirts to help with the temperature. Three fingers gone, and we ran. As Larry ran ahead of me, the sound of a whistle pierced my ear. Then the guard' s deep voice. \" You! Stop! \" And then they fired. Larry, being the bigger of us, was hit first. He knelt down and told me to keep running, so I did. There was no time to lose. It was now or never. Due to my agile build and quick maneuverability, the guards kept missing their shots. They reloaded their guns but by then I had neared the edge of the water. I leaped and dived into the cool water, away from my attackers. Underwater, I felt sad for leaving Larry behind. He was my childhood friend, no, my best friend. I swam to the other edge of the water and resurfaced. I turned around and I could see Larry jumping and cheering. The lifeguards threw their Supersoakers into their office and the one called Jeff gave me a high-five. \" Nice dodging there, buddy, \" he said. But I could n' t hear him.

So you do n' t want to know how I learned how all the sexiest chicks were from the past. Fair enough. You felt that your education was boring and so you had to inflict your exhaustion on me. Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

Oh, revenge is the best drug, and tonight I was a junkie, an addict, and I planned to get my fill. \" Do you remember my sister? Do you remember Marlene? Do you remember the birth mark on her neck? Could you even see it the night you strangled her? \" I twisted the knife with each question, and gleefully watched his face twist with it. \" It was right about... here \". I brought the blade to his neck, gently gliding it across his skin as his body shivered with fright, just like my mum used to, every night. I was n' t done with him yet. His death would n' t be as sweet as his screams. I made sure there was a lot of screaming that night, paired with a lot of dismembered body parts. I laughed as he struggled to remove the chains between my slashes, his eyes as red as the blood his tears fell to. \" What was it you' d tell your friends after you' d beat mum? Oh right,' I had a hell of a time tonight', \" I said between cuts, \" Well guess what, daddy? I' m having a hell of a time tonight. \" I could feel his breathing getting heavier, his body weakening. He would n' t survive long now. I brought the knife between his knees and placed its tip on his. \" I wish mum was here to see this. \" \" Your mother... was a whoring bitch, \" he muttered between gasps, \" You' re just like her. \"",

I look around once I finally begin to get my bearings. I look around and immediately am drawn to the large man - larger than one might expect in life, but given this is the afterlife, a ten foot tall man should be expected - grinning at me over his cup. Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking. Finally I get my sorts together to actually look at more of the room. There are many people laughing and dancing and singing and altogether ignoring me. The walls are adorned with paintings and some of the space filled with sculptures, all of which are a feast for the eyes. I have n' t even taken a step since I opened the door and I am completely stunned by what I see. I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all. The deserts have no seeming order to them, I see tarts here, cakes there, pudding everywhere. Truly the author of all of these things - the works of art, the mead, the deserts, the meats - everything - is a master.",

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and.... Well you see, *world cup* may mean different thing for different people. since I had no interest in football ( some guys call it saucer? ) I thought I would write on cricket World cup. P.

Their eldest son looking after 15 siblings. It seemed fair that he would inherit except for the fact that having spent his life under sedation, he had the appearance of fully grown man but all the capacity of a newborn child.

At that moment, time remained static. The world around us disappeared, leaving only the warmth of hug and our tingling.

Once they were hungry immediately, they would lose interest. Because there are no real packaging or transmission threats, they are almost dangerous. The remaining residents of the town can easily avoid avoiding the corpse or fight against them one by one when needed. At night, most zombies collapsed. A zombie corpse test showed that it died of hunger because it could not hunt or foravly by itself. Within 25 hours, the last zombie has expired, which marks the end of the outbreak. The Center for Disease Prevention and Control announced that zombie threats are neutral. There seems to be no human coordination or wisdom, and a single zombie is harmless. The town began to rebuild, and the federal government began research to better understand how to curb future outbreaks. They hope that this will be as ineffective as the first outbreak. Many people want to know what may happen if zombies even show basic survival skills or instincts, but at present, knowing that threats have passed, residents can rest assured.",

Scientists greeted me with a friendly smile and explained the process of creating my spiritual animal robot. First, they need to scan my body and mind to collect information about my personality, habits and preferences. This will help them create a robot tailor -made for my unique energy and atmosphere. I was lying on a future bed, and scientists began to scan. They assured me that this was completely painless and non -invasive, but when the machine whispered and beeping, I couldn't help feeling a little uneasy. After it feels like eternal, the scan is complete. Scientists have obtained the data to a computer program that uses it to create my mental animal robot. When the machine rotates and buzzed, I waited anxiously. In the end, scientists returned with a small and fashionable robot, looking like a cross between cats and birds. Scientists proudly announced: \"This is your spiritual animal robot.\" \"I have programmed the quality of animals that reflect your personality and vitality.\" I hesitated, not sure what this strange new partner should do. However, when I reached out and touched it, the robot was suddenly lifelike. It blows my hand, soft fur soft fat, can bring soothing fat to my wear nerves. I can't believe it in its natural sense, it looks like it looks like a real animal. When I spend more time with the spiritual animal robot, I started to realize that it had changed my life. It has always been by my side, when I need it, it will provide comfort and companionship. I take it to take a walk, play it, and even work with me. My colleague is fascinated by the robot. Soon, everyone in the office speaks loudly to get his own mental animal robot. With a few days of changes, I have become more and more attached to robots.",

President Levian's government has also promoted a milestone legislation, such as the Equality Law, which provides long -term protection for the LGBTQ+community. Her president's term is not without challenges, because she is facing conservative legislators and the opposition of groups trying to reverse the progress of the term. However, President Lavin persisted and used her platform to promote love, acceptance and inclusiveness. In the process of doing this, she inspired countless people around the world to embrace her true self and fight for freedom to achieve a real life. In the end, President Laiwen's legacy will be remembered as hope, one of the convictions of progress and firmness, that is, everyone should be treated with dignity and respect.

But with the enhancement of strength, my ambition is the same. I want more. I want to be the gods of all the skin of all moisture. I want to rule the supremacy in the entire personal care field. Therefore, I started to expand my influence. I came into contact with the cosmetics industry. I reached an agreement with them to provide them with my blessings in exchange for their loyalty. Slowly but certain, my empire grew up. But with the development of the empire, my reputation also followed. People started to be afraid of me and trembled to mention my name. They see me as dark, greedy, and manipulated God. They see me as a God, and he gets what I want. Maybe they are right. Because I will do anything to ensure the success of my field. I will crush any competitors and threaten my rule. I will use all the skills in the book to maintain my strength. But I don't care. After all, I am God. The gods are not restricted by the same rules as mortal. We can do what we want.",

But these are not ordinary heroes. They did not fight for justice, nor did they protect the hearts of innocent people. No, they are for money. This city is the place where the superhero mercenaries are booming. They call themselves \"protectors\" and are hired by wealthy elites to protect their assets and interests. The other population of the city has always been in a state of fear, knowing that the protector will only intervene only when the price is appropriate. A protector is a man named Valiant. He is a towering character, muscles bulging, piercing blue eyes. His black hair was slippery, and a confident smirk eternally stroking his lips. Valiant is the city's highest -income protector, and he is intoxicated by the luxury he provided by his work. One day, a wealthy businessman named Augustus hired Ying Yong to protect his precious property: a rare, diamond statue. Augustus hosted a charity party, and he wanted to ensure that his valuable cultural relics were exempted from theft or damage. He provided a small guard for heroic people, and did not hesitate to accept the job. As the party approached, Ying Ying wore a stylish black suit and passed through the city's sky, and his cloak fluttered behind him. Just when the sun fell, he arrived at the party. He was replaced by his statue. His dazzling gaze scanned signs of whether the room had trouble. Guests mixed and drinking champagne, ignoring their landlord hiring mercenaries to protect his treasure. Valiant was standing in a statue, and his eyes stared at the small statue because he brought heavy salary to Augustus. But with the night, Ying Yong began to feel uncomfortable. Some things were not sitting beside him.",

She said, \"You know, child, you are a great person. You are kind, clever and talented. Don't forget.\" Her words resonated with me, making me realize that I have always focused on my shortcomings. Since that day, I have consciously strived to change my point of view and focus on my advantages. My grandmother's politeness made me pursue my dream confidently. Many years later, I found that I could help others and make sure that I would convey the information that I encouraged me with my grandmother. I told them that they are also great, and their potential is great. I hope they know that they are not alone, and they take root for them in their corners. When I looked at their eyes, I could see the same hope of my grandmother's burning hope for me a few years ago. This is a powerful moment, which reminds me of a single phrase that can have an impact on someone's life.

At first, I think this is just my imagination, but the voice is getting louder and more persistent. I'm not angry, but I'm sure the voice in my mind is. It always tells me to do something meaningless, such as stealing a bread from the store or jumping into the fountain. I tried to ignore it, but it was difficult when the sound was so long. Sometimes I feel crazy. I tried to tell my friends, but they just laughed and told me that I was paranoid. But I know the sound I heard, and I know this is not normal. I started to worry that the sound may be a more serious sign, such as schizophrenia. I don't know what to do, but I know I need some help. Perhaps the therapist or counselor can help me figure out what happened and how to deal with it.",

You are like an assassin in real life!\" When I continued to play, I began to notice that my movements became smoother and elegant, just like Altair's movements. I can climb the wall, cross the roof, and even wave their sword easily. Sarah and I played games after the game all afternoon. Every time, I inherited the ability and skills of my role.

The White House issued a statement that they expressed their crimes, that is, aliens did not choose to contact them first.

They studied it in the name of science and progress, analyzed it, and even studied it. However, despite their senior knowledge, they have never been able to understand why they tend to hurt them. At first, it was just a small compact. A child pulled out his wings from the flies, and a group of teenagers bullied a weaker classmate. But over time, the damage has become more serious. The war broke out of land, resources and ideology. People hurt each other for no reason because they can. With the past centuries, humans have become more and more advanced. They built towering cities, used the power of the universe, and even colonized other planets. However, despite all progress, they have never tried to get rid of the tendency to hurt each other. One day, a group of scientists decided to study this phenomenon carefully. They conducted experiments, analyzed data, and even observed other species to try to understand why humans were the only intelligent life forms that harmed similar people. They discovered both surprising and disturbing. It seems that humans have the unique ability to sympathize with other creatures, but at the same time, they also have a strange desire, eager to cause pain and pain to those creatures. Scientists are confused. They don't understand why humans do their best to hurt others, even if nothing can benefit from it. They conducted more experiments and tested different theories, but the answers were still elusive. With the passage of years, humans continue to hurt each other. They established large -scale lethal weapons and began a war about minor differences, and even exploited and slavery other species.

The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled. nnNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food. nnI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it. nnMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. nnI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes.

Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices, very few shrimps, mushrooms, roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked, but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy. nnI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise, kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10. For my dish however, I still consider it overpriced for what was supposed to be their fanciest pasta dish. 2. 5 stars for the experience.",

I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait.. . and wait.. . and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills.. . yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later.. . that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion.. .

The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly.

I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda.

We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same. nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day! nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level. nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",

This would be a five star rating if I wasn't considering the grocery store, but this place IS indeed a grocery store and not just a street vendor (unfortunately). nThe grocery store is very poorly organized, things are dusty, and many of the things don't have expiration dates. That's actually pretty typical of imported Asian food, but I was really skeptical about buying anything from the grocery store because no one really shops here (there are better competitors down the street, like Lotus Food Co) and that means that the food remained on the shelf for who knows how long. The first time my friend and I came here, she purchased a pack of mango mochi ice cream and found that it had freezer burn and smelled a bit off as well. The store manager/owner kindly refunded the purchase, which was nice, but I would still never buy anything. Also, compared to Lotus Food Co, some of the items in this store are more expensive. The mochi ice cream was definitely more expensive--I can't remember exactly how much, but after we realized that we bought a bad item, we went to Lotus Food Co and bought a box of mochi ice cream that was perfectly fine, delicious, and less expensive.",

My husband really liked the special of the day, which was  a tuna melt. My bean and corn side salad was very fresh tasting, but could have used a tad more flavor. We also had a key lime coconut cookie that was AMAZING. I might have to go back next week just to get another one!! The servers weren't overly friendly, but they definitely weren't UN-friendly. My only true \"complaint\" is that it is a bit pricy for what you get - it was almost $30 for our lunch of two sandwiches, two drinks, a cookie and a kid's meal- at least the kid's meal included the drink! I will definitely be back to the Prairie Cafe! Don't let the other negative reviews scare you away! The sandwiches are definitely worth it! : )",

One friend chose the same as me except the potato soup and a 1/2 of aturkey club, and the other friend chose a cheesy baked potato. If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter. It was a very quick and friendly process at this location. Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you. Now the food part:  My roast beef sandwich was lacking in thickness of meat, and a bit fatty on the roast beef. My New England clam chowder was hot.. . it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'.. . but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates. The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together. The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous. I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football. Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder? Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater. Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd! It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella. nThe prices for all these items came up to about $25. 00.

Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order.

The Omni hotels have always ben known to be a very nice place and this location was not up to that standard. It was not horrible but for the price some people pay I would expect better. nnWhen staying here I ordered room service several times and it was okay, but nothing special that I could not get anywhere else. I thought the food eas delicious though I just think that for the premium price they ask for you would get more. The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. nnThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. nnAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date. Omni would gain more business if they just did some minor changes",

I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room. nnWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property. nnIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property.

Just a great little joint. nnThe menu is pretty standard deli style. Sandwiches, soups, potatoes, salads. My wife and I usually go for a double-decker pb&j but sometimes we venture out of our mainstay. The potatoes are rather large with a gratuitous amount of toppings. Not my favorite, but worth a try if you're hungrier than usual. I love their Reuben. Not a huge NY style stack of pastrami. Just a medium-sized 'wich with sauerkraut and Thousand Island. Simple and familiar. nnI love Rusty's. A great local, hole in the wall that serves the same dependable food day in and day out. Thanks, Rusty's!",

The beer she recommended \"Red Oak\" a local beer didn't please any of our pallets which made the wait even longer. 4 of 5 orders came out with something wrong so (big surprise) so we just sucked it up and got out of there ASAP. nnI apologize for the long review but this place was so bad I had to share my experiencennDefinitely won't be back",

After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance. nnAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began. After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs. By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well. I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate. I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did. After wards i made a quick exit. nnThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here. I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least. Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment. A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation. It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me. On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you. nnYou've  been warned. nnJay",

Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. nnThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge.

Some of you out there might be saying \"Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check! ). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. nnSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help. nnAnd what's a cake without icing? Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands. Hands, cigarette, mouth, touching customers. YUCK!",

In fact, I double-checked the bill because I thought the waitress may have forgotten to add an entree, it was that reasonably priced! nnThe food was good, solid thai food. My mind wasn't blown, nor was I disappointed. I think all thai restaurants need to unite and decide on a single \"heat scale\" to rule them all. Some places it's 1-5, some 1-10, and I've even seen a 1-7 thrown in here and there. The problem is, they are all subjective to the cook. nnI ordered a 7 out of 10 and got back something milder than mild buffalo wing hot. I think I ruined the food a little by adding my own mix of chilis. My wife loved her curry, and my pad thai wasn't bad. I'd go back, but the search continues.. .",

I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. nnThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet! nnA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation.

Sometimes it can get pretty loud. nnHowever, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine. nnI've tried three entrees: nn1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pastann2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for menn3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had.

There was also a perfect dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not loved it. This stuff, I loved. It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. nnThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going.

At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

The narrow seat arrangement will only exacerbate the problem, without leaving personal space or comfortable space. All in all, at least it can be said that my visit to Bar Louie is disappointed. The bland atmosphere, selfless employees, low -cost foods, high -priced and overwhelming noise levels are the factors that I decide to avoid this place in the future.

However, this service is very slow, waiting for a long time, just to get the menu. This restaurant seems to be insufficient, and it is obvious that the server is overwhelmed. Once we finally try to place orders, before our food arrives at the table, we wait for a long wait. When the food arrives, it is disappointing. My burger is overly cooked and has no taste, but the fries accompanied by the fries are cold and humid. The speech was also boring, as if he had rushed together. The weight is also incredible, especially the price they charge. In addition, the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is dull and exciting. The decoration feels outdated, the lighting is too harsh, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere. The level of noise is very high, so it is difficult to make a dialogue. From a positive point of view, despite being at a loss, the staff made every effort to make them friendly and tolerant. They apologized to delay and checked us many times. However, their efforts are not enough to save the dining experience. Considering my recent interview, I can't warmly recommend that you eat N parks. Although it may be good in some cases, my overall impression is a kind of disappointment. As the service is slow, the medium food and tedious atmosphere, the area must have better dining options.",

It seems that I have seen these exactly the same products before. It is understood that the chain store will have a certain degree of unity, but the lack of uniqueness makes me want more. Another aspect of disappointment is customer service. The staff seemed to be indifferent to helping customers. It is difficult for me to find a colleague who is willing to help me ask for inquiries. When I finally do this, their knowledge seems limited and their attitude is not enthusiastic. This is in sharp contrast to the personalization of people expected when people seeking guidance for home decoration projects. From a positive point of view, the price of this family is competitive. I did find some reasonable prices, especially during seasonal sales. However, the overall experience is lacking, as if it is completely around transactions rather than cultivating a welcome and pleasant shopping environment. The cleanliness of the store is a kind of redemption. Despite the atmosphere of inspiration, the aisle is still a clean organization, and there are no shortage of staff who are committed to keeping neat. I am grateful to the efforts to keep the store, even if it cannot make up for the overall boring experience.",

        "text": "I want to respond to the suggestion of another commentator: Do not pay prepaid. Although it seems convenient to pay products or services in advance, it usually makes you fragile and the merchant's merchant. Once again and again, I saw an example of prepaid and frustration. One of the main reasons to avoid prepaid is that it abandons your ability to make the provider responsible. Once you have your money, they have almost no motivation to give priority to your needs or fulfill their promises. It is always the best to maintain a certain leverage to maintain a satisfactory result depending on your payment. In addition, prepayment may be adventurous in finance. If the environment changes, the company's continuous decline, and the unpredictable incident may be derailed. If you have already paid in full, it is difficult (even if it is not impossible) to withdraw your hard -earned money. Protecting your financial interests is always a priority. Another disadvantage of prepaid is that it limits your flexibility. Life is unpredictable, and we usually need to adjust the plan. By prepayment, you can lock yourself in a specific arrangement without any changes or cancellation space without losing money. Payment after choosing or receiving the product can improve adaptability. In addition, prepayment may lead to a decrease in service level. If the provider has received full payment, it may reduce additional responsibilities or provide first -class help. In many cases, once the transaction is completed, the quality of service will often decrease, making you feel dissatisfied and utilized. In addition, prepayment may be challenging any problems that may occur. Suppose you have already paid before realizing the defects, and the difference or difference. In this case, solving these problems may become a difficult task.",

Crispy cold roll cabbage and rich pickles make the warm and tender meat perfectly supplement. The hand -cut fries increased the pleasant tightening, making the sandwich have a satisfactory texture. The combination of all ingredients does prove the professional knowledge of Primanti Bros. Although they are large, the sandwich is not heavy or greasy. Although the bread is large, it is soft and pillow, providing a reliable foundation for all delicious fillings. When I taste each bite, it is clear why this iconic sandwich has won such a loyal follower. Primanti Bros service is first -class. The staff is friendly, concentrated, and knowledgeable.

The fighting is inconsistent, some scenes are delayed, while others are eager to develop. In addition, lack of role development. The protagonist feels one dimension, and it is difficult to sympathize with their journey. Auxiliary actors have the potential, but they are seriously used and make the opportunity to explore their stories and motivations. From a technical point of view, photography is good, and some sequences show an amazing visual effect. However, the editor is unstable and sometimes it is difficult to follow the narrative. In addition, the sound mixed is unbalanced, and the dialogue is often scored overwhelming. This film's fusion of humor is also bland. These jokes felt forced to cause real laughter. It seems that comedy reliefs have been rushed to increase, and there is not much considering its integration in the overall tone of the movie. From a positive point of view, the production design is impressive, which effectively captures the nature of the story settings. Careful production of clothing and sets enhances the visual attractiveness of the movie. Although the soundtrack is masked by the flawed sound, it has some outstanding tracks, which adds depth to some scenes. Despite the disadvantages, this film does try to provide some fascinating action sequences. At those moments, choreography and special effects are commendable, providing exciting and fascinating sequences, which temporarily attract my attention. It is worth noting that this film does involve related social issues. It is trying to solve the theme of the province and the province, solve the topics such as identity and the consequences of unpredictable power.",

This trail is well maintained, and occasionally the marking guides us. As we rise, the landscape is unfolding in front of us, revealing the amazing panoramic views of the majestic mountains and the green valley.

The sound of flushing has attracted us to enter a hidden waterfall, stacking along the rock surface covered by moss, providing a refreshing rest time. After restoring our interests, we continued to rise, and we encountered wild animals and plants that occasionally encountered along the way. A elegant deer crossing our road seemed to be shocked by our existence. As we reach the steeper terrain, we need to take a closer look at cooperation with teams, and climbing becomes more and more challenging. Our determination and mutual support have enhanced the connection between us and make the experience even more memorable.

We found a perfect and favorable position, witnessed the sky under the setting sun, with gold and pink hue. This is a magical moment, always engraved in our memory. As the soul rises, we have begun to decline and reflect on the incredible adventure we shared. This mountain has tested our physical and mental strength, but it has also brought us a reward for the sense of accomplishment and the new discovery of the beauty of the natural world.

The familiar blue and white color scheme brought back the memories of my childhood shopping travel. However, as I entered the store deeper, it is obvious that KMART strives to keep up with the changing era. The once bustling aisle now looks sparse, shelves are displayed with limited products. It seems that KMART and online retailers and larger chain stores have lost their competitive advantages. In the outdated display and cramped layout, the lack of modernization is obvious, so it is difficult to navigate in the chaotic part. I noticed that the staff seemed to be disconnected and not enthusiastic, which further promoted the boring shopping experience. With obvious customer service, I feel that I seem to be another anonymous face in the crowd. Despite the shortcomings, KMART still managed to retain some loyal customers, and several people browsed the aisle. The store does have redemption quality, such as affordable family supplies and discounted clothing. The bargaining hunter may still find comfort in the wide -priced products of the store. One of the prominent aspects for me is the customs clearance part, where I accidentally discovered a large transaction of the items about production. However, the overall organization of the store makes it challenging to find specific items even when it is needed. When I went to the checkout counter, I couldn't help feeling sad. Kmart was once an idol of the US retail industry and is now a relic of faded in the past. The decline of this once -invested store reflects the changing landscape of the retail industry. In short, although Darren's comments have triggered my curiosity, my personal experience in Kmart has a lot left.",

The staff seemed to be selfless and uncomfortable, which clearly showed that customer satisfaction was not their primary task. The choice of Tyrannoi is extremely limited. They are indeed outdated and good. It seems that they have not updated their inventory for many years. The installation process is also a nightmare. The staff did not measure accurately, which left me a good dovetail, which looked embarrassing and uncomfortable. The most important thing is that the dirt tails they provide are dirty and have obvious stains. It seems that they didn't bother to clean it before renting. When I pointed out this problem, they seemed to be indifferent and did not provide any solutions or apologies. To make matters worse, the dirt tail began to collapse during the event. The buttons are loose, and the seams are coming. This is very embarrassing, and it was ruined all night for me. I never expected that the rental service would provide such low -quality clothing. The pricing is also very high, because they have poor quality. I could have rented a better dovetail from another place at a lower price. Obviously, this rental service uses customers by charging high -priced fees from Subpar products. Customer services are equally bad. When I called my dissatisfaction and asked for a refund, I encountered a rude and helpless representative. They refused to admit their mistakes or have any responsibility for my terrible experience. In short, I strongly recommend not to use this kind of dovetail leasing service. The lack of professionalism, poor choice, dirty and unsuitable dirt tails, and non -response customer services have completelyted time and money.",

I have been eagerly looking forward to the dinner of this famous TEPPANYAKI restaurant, and I heard the praise from friends and colleagues. However, my recent visits made me very disappointed and frustrated. First of all, this service is shocking and slow. Despite reservation in advance, I and I had been waiting for nearly 30 minutes before sitting down. The hostess seems to be at a loss and confusion. Obviously, she lacks the necessary skills for effective management seat arrangements. After finally sitting down, we eagerly waited for the chef to reach the table and started preparing our meals. However, anyone spent a long time to admit our existence. The lack of communication between employees will only increase our growing frustration because we become more hungry in one minute. When the chef finally arrived, his bland performance further suppressed our spirit. He doesn't seem to be interested and enthusiastic, just through any talent and performance skills expected by the TEPPANYAKI chef we expect. The food itself is mediocre, the taste is lacking, and the ingredients appear insufficient. In addition, that night, the restaurant's vibrant and active atmosphere seemed tedious. Background music is almost invisible, and there is no lack of cheerful and laughter that makes this experience strange. It seems that the soul of the restaurant has fallen into an unpopular vacation. With the development of the night, we found that we kept seeking the attention of Waitstaff, and Waitstaff seemed to be more interested in their own conversations, rather than meet the needs of diners. We asked other condiments and supplementary requests to be ignored, making us feel ignored and frustrated.",

The moment we walked in, we were coveted with mouth -watering meat and freshly grilled bread. The atmosphere is full of vitality, full of locals and tourists, creating vibrant energy, thereby increasing the overall experience. The menu of Primanti Bros is the dream of carnivores. With a variety of sandwiches, it is full of meat, cheese and cold cabbage, which is difficult to start from. I chose their classic \"almost famous\" sandwiches, including thick spiced smoked beef, melted Swiss cheese, and the generous help of signature cold -rolled cabbage. All of them were sandwiched between two soft Italian bread. The flavor and texture of each bite are perfectly balanced. The rich and roll -rollful cabbage is replenished. Different from other sandwiches, the Primanti Bros is uniquely added to the sandwich uniquely to sandwiches. This unconventional distortion adds an extra layer of indulgence and satisfactory tightening to each bites. French fries are cooked outside, gold and crispy, and the interior is still tender. This is an annoying experience, and you will soon be able to master each napkin paper you experience. In addition to the famous sandwich, Primanti Bros also offers various other dishes to satisfy different desires. Their corn slices were hit on our table, full of melting cheese, strong Mexican pepper and homemade peppers. The combination of taste is great and is made for delicious appetizers. Primanti Bros has a very friendly and efficient service. The staff provides useful suggestions and ensures that our glasses are always filled. In view of the popularity of the restaurant, it is understandable to understand the waiting of the table, but once we sit down, this is worth it.",

One of the biggest problems of Sentry is the quality of the product. Agricultural products are usually withered or rotten, and the meat is not very fresh. Packaging products are often damaged or expired. I also found that the price of Sentry is higher than the price of other grocery stores in the area. Another problem of the sentinel is the cleanliness of the store. The floor is usually dirty, the shelves are soil, and the bathroom is not always clean. I also saw that employees handle food without gloves, which is a kind of health hazard.

It sounds good, so one of our friends decided to buy only one white rice, while the other had one egg. I ordered a sesame chicken, and our server said that this is the most popular dish on the menu. He also brought a large bowl of steamed white rice for the three of us to share. We started from the spring roll order, and then fry it into golden yellow, and with a typical dipping sauce. They are delicious. Our main cuisine also appeared quickly. My sesame chicken is delicious, but the bread crumbs are a bit thick. White rice is fluffy and moist, as if it should be. We said that it was perfect with white rice. The sun is fluffy and fluffy, with a lot of vegetables on it. Tofu fry well, but it is too spicy for my friends. Our server is very careful and friendly.

In the first few minutes, I jumped loudly. The plot is concentrated in a family that is said to be a haunted house. Strange noise and witnesses began to happen immediately. It seems that this house has a dark past and is now plagued by a new family. With the development of the movie, the supernatural activity upgrades to a truly frightening encounter. Objects began to move on their own and disturbing news on the wall. No one in the family can avoid the violation of the malicious soul. The family desperately tried to escape the house, but it seemed that the entity was too powerful. Although some scenes are terrible, I find that I can't look away. In the end, I felt completely uneasy and on the edge. When my imagination was crazy, I spent a while before going to bed. If you think you are a scared cat, I strongly recommend waiting for the cat to appear in the video. Overall, this is a carefully made ghost story that will shake you. Just don't watch alone!",

This is the biggest and most fluffy meat roll in my history. The dining area itself has warm and seductive wooden boards and comfortable stalls. It is also very convenient to approach my house, so this is a simple choice for leisure weekend breakfast. In the morning on a slower working day, the experience is easier.

After that, when I tried to arrange a subsequent appointment, the receptionist accused me of being difficult and refused to find a valid time. Then, I asked for a complaint on my experience and was told them that they would not accept complaints. On the way out, I heard the receptionist laugh at the previous \"difficult\" patient. I will never return to this office, nor will I recommend it to anyone, because I have shown unacceptable levels of disrespect. Obviously for me, they do not pay attention to people or their time.

This restaurant provides two accounts, provides many fresh classic Chinese dishes, and provides reasonable prices. Although the dining room is very small and basic, the dining time is very busy, and customers seek to afford a bitter bite. Outstanding figures of menu include house Lo Mein, sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli -price share. Customers' favorite also includes steamed dumplings and House Chow Mein, although the quality is really slightly different. For restaurants in the leisure community, the cherry house has obtained the most recipes and satisfies the desire without blowing the budget. However, those who seek high -quality or abnormal Chinese food are best to explore higher prices in other places. The atmosphere and service are simply unconditional; the focus is to quickly enter and exit the food for dining or takeaway. Although Cherry House is not the most luxurious dining experience, it fulfills the function of budget -friendly Chinese people without damaging too much taste. When time is tightened or funded, it is still reliable. Overall, Cherry House provides the fast and cheap Chinese food that it promotes, making it worthwhile. Just don't expect the tip food or luxurious atmosphere.",

Whether dining on a spacious restaurant or outdoor meal on the terrace, this service is always friendly and careful. As an additional reward, they have a complete bar to provide craft beer, special cocktails and wine. Pizza has fresh ingredients every day, and has high -quality ingredients -it is difficult to make mistakes in any choice. When resting in the midfield, the line may last for a long time, but they do well to make the waiting time reasonable. My favorite is their Margareta pizza -fresh Marri -La cheese, tomatoes and Lales shining. They also provide gluten -free and vegetarian choices for people with diet or preferences. For desserts, their Brownie cakes and biscuits can satisfy any sweets. On a busy night, you may need to wait for the table, but they have the opportunity to enjoy wine when they provide a bar seat and watch the game. Outdoor space is dog -friendly, which is an additional number. The price is very fair for your quality and weight. Regardless of whether you carry out business or entertainment in the urban area, BrixX is always a reliable choice for food and time with old and new friends. This is one of the signature venues visited during Shangcheng, Charlotte. Every time I eat here, I am satisfied. Employees work hard to ensure that everyone has rich experience. This position is the first choice of the party at any time of the year. BRIXX insists on high standards for food, atmosphere and service -they have won many loyal local fans.",

We will not return to this restaurant, we will definitely warn other people's experience. Employees and managers need to conduct serious training in customer service and problems. To my surprise, this restaurant is still running the terrible service level we receive. There seems to be no other people to solve the customer's problems and complaints in time. The atmosphere of this restaurant is very good, but this does not make up for the real poor customer service from beginning to end.

I have spent 2 hours in the past two days to try to complete the top of 5 minutes with the acting agent. I guess I will soon reach the waiting time for the current phone for 1 hour. At this time, I think I will lose patience and rationality. For anyone who considers TWC elsewhere, if you sign a contract with them, this comment is a major warning. I can only hope that there will be a miracle when I call next time, and I don't have to endure these long and meaningless holdings. Ending with hopeful notes, your fingers cross the next agent to help me and end this nightmare customer service experience!",

With more than 20 slides, a huge wave pool and the lazy river of the entire facility, those who seek excitement will be overwhelmed. My family was riding a slide all day all day long. For example, the bottle turned on, and it twisted the rider before sending it off at a high speed. The size of the wave pond is impressive, and it will be a few feet high every few minutes. When we float gently, we like to relax along the pipes of the lazy river and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the surrounding scenery. All slides are limited to ensure safety, but even young visitors can join slides like The Tadpole. This is a simple straight slide, which is very suitable for beginners. The water park also has a large beach entrance area, which is very suitable for beach games such as relaxation or volleyball in the sun. One day, we ate in a full service restaurant in the water park, which is convenient for us to eat overall. Food and services are very good. Although the price is too high, this is a typical price of the theme park. Employees are very careful and have enough lifeguards to monitor guests in swimming pools and slides. Water temperature is always comfortable, neither cold nor hot. In the busy days, the most popular slide lines are longer, but there are usually other slides and attractions, and there is almost no waiting. Overall, the water park provides a whole day of exciting activities for people of all ages. There is no doubt that this is the best part of this resort. The water park has allowed family entertainment for several hours, which is a real highlight for families seeking unforgettable summer vacations.",

On beautiful days, the majestic Renil Mountain often sees a beautiful background on the horizon. I have never had a really bad travel experience, or connected through the Seattle -Tacoma Airport. It is easy to see why it has always been the customer satisfaction and high -quality survey ranking of medium -sized airports. Even if it is a smaller regional operator, each seat has a power socket and other facilities. The airport is done well without losing its function and efficient purpose.

Although this new team may take some time to become the playoffs competitors, they play with courage and show glory to top opponents. The believers of Buzz City really embraced their team again and turned the night of the game into the electrical atmosphere of the Warner Cable. It is very interesting that Kemba Walker, a defender with high scores, played his role as a team of players as a team star player.

The service is always friendly and careful, and quickly and effectively provides food and drinks. One of my favorite items on the menu is grilled chicken sandwiches, with crispy sweet potato strips. The chicken is marinated with a strong and fragrant spice mixture, grilled until perfect, and is eaten on soft and fluffy bread. Cook the sweet potatoes to the perfect crispy state, season with a small amount of salt and pepper, and heat it fresh. Another popular choice is a vegetarian quinoa bowl with a variety of roasted vegetables, quinoa and drizzle cream sesame sauce. The quinoa is cooked with nuts, fluffy texture, and with tender sweet roasted vegetables. TAHINI sauce adds rich and cream elements to the dishes, combining all flavors. In addition to food, beverage menu is also impressive. Kabchino coffee is made of high -quality beans, which is skilled and brewed to cause rich and smooth texture. The coffee is hot and strong, with a large amount of foam on the top. Tea is also very wide, with various herbal medicines and caffeine -containing choices. The price of this restaurant is very reasonable, especially the quality of food and services. These parts are generous, making me feel satisfied but not very satisfied. The restaurant also provides a loyalty plan, providing rewards to regular customers through discounts and special offers. Overall, this restaurant is a great choice for leisure lunch or dinner. I strongly recommend it to anyone in the area.",

The menu is impressive, and various dishes are in line with various diet preferences. However, these options are overwhelming, and I find it difficult to choose only one main course. I ordered the grilled salmon, and the salmon arrived, lacking the spacious size I expected. Cooked the fish to perfect, but a small part of the vegetables made me feel dissatisfied. There are more and more waiters who have been friendly at the beginning of my meal, because he realized that I would not order other dishes or drinks. He rarely stopped.

Their ramen bowl is rich and delicious, tender noodles and juicy meat. Sushi is also first -class, with fresh and perfect balance. I am a loyal supporter of their iconic seasoning, especially spicy egg yolk sauce -it adds a good football to any dish. These parts are generous, so I always feel satisfied but not very satisfied. The price is very reasonable, especially considering the high quality of food. I have never experienced bad experiences in SOBA, and I have been looking forward to my next visit. In short, for anyone who is looking for delicious and pleasant meals in an interesting and casual environment, the Soba foam is an excellent choice.",

I arrived at the restaurant around 6:30 pm and was welcomed by the friendly hostess. She showed me a comfortable window. When I dine, I could watch the hustle and bustle of the street outside. The atmosphere is full of vitality and seductive, accompanied by couples, families and solo meals like me. Decoration is modern and stylish, focusing on clean lines and bold colors. I ordered a cup of Pinot Grigio, which was clear and fresh. The wine list provides a variety of reds, white and foam wines. I am glad to see some of them available. The menu is diverse and attractive. Various dishes reflect the restaurant's attention to seasonal local ingredients. I was torn between grilled salmon and vegetarian noodles, but finally decided the latter. My pasta arrived immediately, and I was immediately shocked by the bright colors and spacious parts. The taste is bold and balanced, perfectly fusion of herbs and spices. Fresh vegetables are cooked to perfect. I thank each of the details of each bite. In my entire dining, this service is careful and friendly, and the attention of employees is not too much nor too much. When I need to supplement the wine, it will be delivered in time and then checks at the right time. The total cost of my meals, including Groupon and generous skills, reached about $ 40. Although this seems to be steep for some people, I think the quality of food and services makes it worth investing.",

For anyone who is looking for reliable and comfortable hotels in the city center, Marriott Center is a good choice. This is a very valuable price, and I will definitely book again.",

Egg rolls are not as crispy as usual, and LO Mein is a bit cooked. I also noticed that these parts became smaller and smaller over time. I remember when the egg rolls were large and filled with a lot of vegetables and meat. Now, they are smaller and less filling. Tang is still very good. I always get sour and sour soup, and I am always delicious and satisfactory. The atmosphere is also very good. Decoration is a traditional Chinese, which is dim and creates a comfortable atmosphere. The price is also reasonable. I never felt that I had too much meal. Despite small problems, I still recommend the Chinese palace to my friends and family. This is a reliable choice for delicious Chinese food. The waiting staff is also very friendly and careful. They always fill my water cup and check to ensure that everything is satisfied. One of the annoying things is that they do not get a credit card. Before I come here, I always have to go to the ATM. In general, what I want to say is that if you are looking for a fast and satisfactory Chinese meal, the Chinese Palace is a good choice. Just prepare a smaller part without a credit card.",

However, the quality of the pastry is inconsistent, and some pastries are too sweet, while others lack flavor. Horn bread is highlights, slices and butter, and has a perfect taste. Cakes are visually attractive, but frosting may be too sweet and overwhelming. The coffee of the bakery is average. It is not special except for matching with baked food. The atmosphere is comfortable and attractive, comfortable and friendly seats. The price is reasonable and consistent with other bakers in the area. Overall, Paddy Cake Bakery is a good choice for those who seeks leisure bakery experience, but for those who seek high -quality pastries, this is not the best choice.",

It is easy to be suffocated by the concrete jungle. I find that a certain dose of fresh air and green plants can bring miracles to my mental health. I recently discovered a hidden gem in the park that was only a few steps away from the city center. This is a tranquil oasis, which is very suitable for picnic or leisurely. The park is surrounded by towering trees. These trees cover the noise of most cities, and the ground has been carefully maintained. The lush grass and colorful flowers bloom throughout the year. There is even a small pond, you can feed ducks or boats here. This is a huge hustle and bustle of escape urban life. I strongly recommend it to anyone who seek peace and meditation.",

I look forward to this restaurant a lot, but it is not delivered in all aspects. The menu options are limited and have no inspiration, there is nothing particularly unique or exciting. The quality of the ingredients is doubtful, with a faint taste and unsigned texture. These parts are small, making you feel dissatisfied and charged. The selection of beverages is not high, and the execution is less. The bar service is very slow, waiting for a long time, forgetful bartender. The atmosphere is not attractive, with dim lighting and overall discomfort. I look forward to a beautiful night, but this restaurant has not been provided. I will not recommend it to anyone, nor will I come back. Unfortunately, because the location is very convenient, it seems hopeful outside. However, it is disappointing inside, lacks attention to details and a general sense of mediocrity. Overall, I will give the restaurant's 5 -star 2 stars. This is not worth money or time, and the region has better choices. Help yourself, avoid this.",

Decoration is a classic sports bar. The TV covers every inch of the wall, and the souvenirs are scattered throughout the process. We grabbed a table next to the bar and read the menu carefully. The menu provided many bars' fares, including burgers, sandwiches and salads. We ordered some appetizers, including buffalo wings and fried kimchi. Both were delicious and generously distributed. My husband chose a \"terrible towel\" burger with the theme of the steel man with cold rolls of cabbage and fries, and I went to the classic grilled chicken sandwich. This service is timely and careful, and our server often sign in on us to ensure that everything is satisfactory. The food arrived quickly, we dug in and tasted every bite. The quality of food is impressive, the flavor pops up, and the portion is spacious. In our entire dining, we were treated with live music, which was played by a talented local musician. Music supplements a lively atmosphere, creating an interesting and festive atmosphere, making us feel that we are part of action. Overall, our experience in Sports Rock Cafe is great.

You will find a large warehouse -style store, and provide various large -scale products, grocery and electronic products. The price is usually competed with other warehouse clubs, and it usually has sales and promotion. I noticed that a difference between BJ and Sam's Club is the layout of the store. BJ seems to have a more organized and easier layout, clear signs and logical processes to the aisle. On the other hand, the Sam Club will feel more chaotic and overwhelming. Another advantage of BJ is their membership benefits. They provide various membership levels, including basic membership qualifications of individuals and families, and corporate membership qualifications for small business owners. These membership qualifications have privileges such as discounts such as certain items, free delivery of online orders and special promotions. One thing to remember when shopping at BJ is that they have the minimum purchase requirements for certain items. If you just want to buy something, this may be a bit frustrated, but if you plan to buy in batches, this is worth it. In general, I suggest anyone in BJ wants to buy a convenient and cost -effective way to buy bulk items and groceries. They provide extensive choices, competitive prices and valuable membership benefits. Just prepare for the busy shopping experience, especially on weekends.",

This is an ideal place to satisfy your sweets. I tried other cakes in Pamela's, but I always returned to the yellow cake, chocolate frosting. That's it. The best part? It is not too sweet, so you can enjoy it without feeling GUI. I brought my friends and family to Pamela, and they all liked it. This is a good place for special occasions or random treatment. And the price is very reasonable, especially the quality of desserts. I'm not sure what magic did Pamela use during baking, but this is really special. Every bite of the yellow cake will bring me to a pure and joyful place. It's like a small piece of heaven in a piece. I know that some people may say that the yellow cake is boring, but I believe me, Pamela's version is not just. This is the classic reason. And chocolate frosting? This is the perfect supplement of the cake. I tried to make yellow cakes at home, but it was never the cake of Pamela. Maybe this is the love and care she put in each slice, or just her secret component. No matter what it is, it can. For many years, I have been praising Pamela's yellow cake, I am not the only one. This is the local favorite. Once you try, you will understand the reason. This is indeed a special thing. Therefore, perhaps the blasphemy says that Pamela's yellow cake is the best, but I don't care. real. If you don't believe me, please try it yourself. You will not be disappointed.",
