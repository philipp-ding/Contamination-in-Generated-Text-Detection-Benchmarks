We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at highGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-likebehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.",

HS0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbitalperiod of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observedphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopicbehaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These newadditions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per centof the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating therequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and themodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becomingmore pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h periodinterval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed byour results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of theHamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbitalperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems closeto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with thestandard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have thehighest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range ofcommon properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.",

Inthis paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fieldsthrough comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). Wefind that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed ofboth intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not showstrong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, inthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in theeastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent starformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to thewestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CFanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in theseparts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located inthe southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southernfields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all theCMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferredfrom the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here aredominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lackof a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicatethat a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observedfields.",

These morphological classifications are compared tolocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surfacemass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification.

A correlation is also found between morphology and localprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to thenearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is moreimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown ofthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in thegalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of redgalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry fromCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passivegalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescriptionof Wolf et al.

Previous models ofSolar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapseof the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a veryclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questionsrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a closesupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulationsdemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock toescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass lossoccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of thedisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. Theselow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that thehigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the diskbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to beconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. Onthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed intodust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will beinjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoriticabundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore areconsistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.",

Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, andSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end uplocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, theresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets inthe disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance forthe two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped orreversed.

For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins ortranscription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levelsof downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework toinvestigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by theanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of theexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfersystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in theabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolicnetwork. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation indifferent nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagateelsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freelyshared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to studymetabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networkswhich are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications forbioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.",

The method makes use of the probability generating function(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random networkand makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in awell-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number ofinfecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translatingbetween network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemicincidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking theevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds.

We examine the spectra of 137quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find noclear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comovingMpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest withoutadditional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth duringcosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), todescribe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift aroundz = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individualneighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models inwhich the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percentat z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large(40-50 Angstrom) voids.

Therefore, it is important to study numericallythe collisional outcome from low velocity impacts of equal sized porousagglomerates which are too large to be examined in a laboratory experiment. Weuse the Lagrangian particle method Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics to solve theequations that describe the dynamics of elastic and plastic bodies.Additionally, to account for the influence of porosity, we follow a previousdeveloped equation of state and certain relations between the material strengthand the relative density. Collisional growth seems possible for rather lowcollision velocities and particular material strengths. The remnants ofcollisions with impact parameters that are larger than 50% of the radius of thecolliding objects tend to rotate. For small impact parameters, the collidingobjects are effectively slowed down without a prominent compaction of theporous structure, which probably increases the possibility for growth. Theprotoplanetesimals, however, do not stick together for the most part of theemployed material strengths. An important issue in subsequent studies has to bethe influence of rotation to collisional growth. Moreover, for realisticsimulations of protoplanetesimals it is crucial to know the correct materialparameters in more detail.",

Radiative recombination continua(RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that theemission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDYphotoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column densitymodel (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing alldetected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-liketriplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data wereignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux fromintercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonanceline data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only twocomponents.

We findthat the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and systemsize, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite systemsize do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topologicalentropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for anyinfinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant asthe temperature is further increased.

Furthermore, it has beenrecently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have aresolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find highermodularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms.

The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed andasymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observedasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in theouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic andsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of ourobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule isgravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggestthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of theouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state nearhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internalsupport. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsationwould be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule dueto the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for thedouble-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinctionmaps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinctiondata provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ whileN2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visualextinction.",

The lack of any bright SN down tovery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,strikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we presentspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that theburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic breakis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with thebreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviourand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the bestexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglowlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there isstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a breakfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early timesand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying athigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-raylight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extendedemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show thatthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRTobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exitsit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24keV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is howeverdistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.Considering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistentwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.",

Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity ofstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are opticallythin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empiricalmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can beoptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account forclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumpsreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergentspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that theoptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PVresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken intoaccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line andrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumpingmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha linein O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of opticallythick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimatingempirical mass-loss rates.",

The study of diffusion on such networks ismotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronizationproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport onnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a richphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context ofrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, andin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to themotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established thatin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small densityof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interactiontopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In somecases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in theEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. Thisbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, wherethe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of anaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are alsoconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of thenetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework forthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finitenetworks.

Inthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in thepropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactorexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes ofdecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, bymeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. Byassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrinomixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar norKamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whosecharacteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained.

The main results are the following. 1) Thecirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previouslyoverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is inaccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at agiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasingamplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dustemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on averagebut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions havesystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness andkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strongnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron powerspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a functionof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modificationof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproducethe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.",

Inp-wave systems involving the mixture of two-hyperfine states, we show that theinterference pattern exhibits a polarization effect depending on the relativeorientation of the two vector order parameters. Lastly, we also point out thatp-wave Fermi condensates exhibit an anisotropic expansion, reflecting thespatial anisotropy of the underlying interaction between fermions and theorbital nature of the vector order parameter.

Accurate photometry(especially for faint sources) requires two simple processing steps beyond thestandard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients. Point spreadfunction (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densitiesthan aperture photometry. Based on the PSF fitting photometry, the calibrationfactor shows no strong trend with flux density, background, spectral type,exposure time, or time since anneals. The coarse-scale calibration sampleincludes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, onbackgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. Thecoarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) andis based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,respectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from twostars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all timescales probed. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +/- 294MJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) based on 10 stars. The uncertainty inthe coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5%photometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma,500 s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy. This work showsthat the MIPS 70 micron array produces accurate, well calibrated photometry andvalidates the MIPS 70 micron operating strategy, especially the use of frequentstimulator flashes to track the changing responsivities of the Ge:Ga detectors.",

For example, the quantumenergy levels of dopants will be affected by the proximity of nanometer-scaleelectrodes. Moreover, because shallow donors and acceptors are analogous tohydrogen atoms, experiments on small numbers of dopants have the potential tobe a testing ground for fundamental questions of atomic and molecular physics,such as the maximum negative ionization of a molecule with a given number ofpositive ions[4,5]. Electron tunneling spectroscopy through isolated dopantshas been observed in transport studies[6,7]. In addition, Geim and coworkersidentified resonances due to two closely spaced donors, effectively formingdonor molecules[8]. Here we present capacitance spectroscopy measurements ofsilicon donors in a gallium-arsenide heterostructure using a scanning probetechnique[9,10]. In contrast to the work of Geim et al., our data showdiscernible peaks attributed to successive electrons entering the molecules.Hence this work represents the first addition spectrum measurement of dopantmolecules.

However, the process of collaboration introducessignificant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the sameinformation. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces thecollaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the firstphase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when theyoccur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the secondphase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system andbeamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. Thisstep requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complexnumber, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and whichenables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the networkcoordinates.

The cost of games - especially computer games - toys and hobbies shot up by 2.7%.Prices are also on the rise for clothing, up 0.6% compared with a fall of 0.3% a year ago, with children's clothing seeing the biggest increase.The ONS also reported higher prices for furniture and household goods.Shoppers have been used to falling prices in the supermarket aisles in recent years but this trend is now at an end.Sugar, jams, chocolate, syrups and confectionary all contributed to the latest rise in this category.With inflation now at its highest rate in nearly four years, the impact of past falls in sterling continue to feed through to households, according to Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics: \"Food inflation rose by 2.5% according to the latest data, the fastest since 2013. Given the least affluent households spend around 17% of their expenditure on food and drink, rising prices will have a significant impact on their discretionary spending power going forward.\"What's more, real earnings are already shrinking. With inflation expected to accelerate further in the coming months, the backdrop for retailers looks set to become even more challenging.\"Electricity bills jumped by 4% and gas bills were also slightly up, reflecting price hikes from some of the big six energy suppliers.But travel costs were down. Air fares usually go down after Easter, one of the peak holiday periods. Because Easter came later this year, air fares fell back in May, which was a big contributor to the downward effect.And the prices at the pump also dropped between April and May this year, bringing some relief, at least, to consumers.",

It will be easier for us to manage.\"The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would \"dramatically improve the design\" of the station.Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: \"HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.\"She said the council is \"ardently opposed to the scheme\", adding it could only be a success with \"close collaboration\" between the local authority, residents and businesses.HS2 Ltd's new plan will be submitted to Parliament next week in order to form part of the legislation which will allow phase one of High Speed 2 to go ahead.The firm also announced that the budget of the Euston project has risen from Â£2 billion to Â£2.25 billion, but said this would not affect HS2's overall budget of Â£42 billion.",

Britain is becoming a nation of value shoppers.\"He added Travelodge's current owners were \"not natural long-term holders of the business\".\"I think you'd expect them always to be thinking about ways to realise value from their shareholdings, but for now we stay focused on running the business we have got,\" he said.Travelodge said a £100m modernisation programme was now nearing completion, while five of 15 hotels new properties expected for 2015 were already open.The chain has opened more than 500 hotels since launching in 1985 and has identified 250 more sites across the UK.Mr Gowers said the first 150 were expected to be ready over the next eight years.",

Henrietta Rushwaya, once the federation chief executive, received a life ban for the second time for involvement in the attempted fixing.Rushwaya was banned for life after a previous match-fixing scandal, but that sanction was overturned.

His tweet of apology was met with comments below it, calling him \"utterly disgraceful\" and \"appalling\".The Daily Mail article appeared in both the print copy of the newspaper and its online version.Marr's wife, journalist Jackie Ashley, tweeted about Letts' article, criticising the message it sent out to disabled people.The Stroke Association said: \"A stroke is not a joke. Stroke survivors deserve our respect and support, and Andrew Marr deserves an apology\", before encouraging people make complaints to the Independent Press Standards Organisation.In a statement to the BBC, the Independent Press Standards Organisation said: \"we have received a total of 11 complaints about the article.\"All of the complaints are under Clause 12 (Discrimination), with one or two also citing Clause 1 (Accuracy) or Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock).\"It is IPSO policy not to comment on the identity of individual complainants, so I am unable to confirm the names of anyone who has contacted us on this article.\"Robert Peston's new ITV Sunday politics talk show had received lukewarm reviews following its debut this weekend.Letts reviewed Peston's programme as \"breathless and batty - and bound to be a hit\".",

Documents were seized both from there and from the bank he heads in Sao Paulo.At the same time, the leader of the governing Workers Party in the Senate, Delcidio Amaral, was also arrested.Both men are accused of obstructing the course of the investigation.Mr Esteves is Brazil's 13th richest man, worth an estimated $2.5bn (Â£1.7bn), while Mr Amaral is the first sitting legislator to be detained in the scandal.After his arrest early on Wednesday, police released a recording in which Mr Amaral appears to suggest that the imprisoned former head of Petrobras' international division should refrain from disclosing any evidence about Mr Amaral and Mr Esteves.In exchange, the Petrobras executive, Nestor Cervero, would be helped to escape from Brazil to Europe, reports said.The tape was secretly recorded by Cervero's son. He told Brazilian media that his father and he had disagreed with the escape plan.Later on Wednesday, the Senate held an emergency session and backed up the Supreme Court's decision to arrest Mr Amaral.More than 100 people have now been arrested in the two-year investigation, including politicians and former top executives at Petrobras, and some of the country's biggest construction firms.Although Brazil's President and former Petrobras Chair Dilma Rousseff has not been directly implicated in the scandal she is under severe political pressure over its implications, says the BBC's Wyre Davis in Rio de Janeiro.The president of the Workers Party, Rui Falcao, has published a statement distancing himself from the disgraced senator.He said was \"perplexed by the facts\" that led to the arrest.\"None of the acts attributed to the senator is connected to his activities for the party.\"For that reason, the Workers Party does not feel obliged to lend him any solidarity,\" added Mr Falcao.",

It is an innovative method that leverages observations to enhance the precision of numerical models. The approach combines concepts from optimal estimation theory and the laws of physics governing the behavior of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system, which describes the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids like Earth's liquid outer core.In this study, a simplified version of the MHD system is considered—a one-dimensional, nonlinear model with sparsely distributed observations. This setup is designed to mimic critical aspects of the geomagnetic field's behavior. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in recovering the true state of the system from limited and noisy measurements. The findings underscore the utility of variational geomagnetic data assimilation, especially in scenarios with limited and noisy observations. The study highlights the benefits of this approach and paves the way for further exploration and implementation in more complex and realistic settings.",

The scheme assigns transmission rates to each sensor based on the observed correlation between sensor data. It is shown through analysis and simulation that the proposed scheme can achieve efficient distributed coding performance while detecting and mitigating the influence of Byzantine sensors transmitting arbitrary data.

This article presents a novel approach for clustering the co-occurrence of maximal frequent patterns in data streams. Frequent pattern mining is applied to generate maximal frequent patterns from each sliding window of the stream. The co-occurrence relationship between patterns is then represented as a graph structure. A graph clustering algorithm is adapted to group similar patterns together based on their co-occurrence links. This allows patterns in the stream to be grouped according to their common attributes and behaviors over time. The algorithm is fully incremental and able to dynamically update the clustering as new windows of data arrive. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the clustering can effectively discover meaningful pattern groups from synthetic and real data streams. The memory and time complexity of the algorithm is also analyzed. Several parameter sensitivity tests are performed to understand their impact on clustering quality. Finally, potential applications of the clustered patterns in ranking, classification and anomaly detection are discussed. The proposed approach offers an effective way to analyze and monitor evolving patterns in high-speed streams.",

It is demonstrated that the initial conditions of the progenitor star, such as its mass, composition, and rotation, play a crucial role in shaping the resulting SNR morphology. Additionally, the influence of the surrounding interstellar medium on the expansion and evolution of the remnant is discussed. The interplay between hydrodynamical instabilities, magnetic fields, and shock interactions is explored, shedding light on the mechanisms that lead to the observed asymmetries. Furthermore, the role of environmental factors, such as the presence of molecular clouds or stellar winds, is examined as potential contributors to the observed morphological variations. Finally, theoretical predictions are confronted with observational data from a comprehensive sample of bilateral SNRs, providing insights into the connection between the underlying physical processes and the observed asymmetries.

However, the long term evolution of magnetic turbulence in such environments remains uncertain. In this theoretical study, we use particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the evolution of magnetic turbulence over long timescales in electron-positron plasmas characteristic of relativistic collisionless shocks. The simulations demonstrate that magnetic turbulence is efficiently generated during the initial shock crossing as the plasma isotropizes and heats. On longer timescales, the turbulence is found to gradually decay as kinetic energy is transferred to microscopic plasma waves. This decay occurs regardless of initial turbulent power on scales comparable to and larger than the plasma skin depth. The rate of decay is dependent on initial turbulence intensity, with more energetic initial fields decaying faster. Our results indicate magnetic field amplification via the Weibel instability quickly saturates, and that sustained non-thermal particle acceleration may require continual driving of turbulence behind the shock. The long-term evolution of magnetic turbulence revealed in this work provides new insight into particle energization in collisionless astrophysical shocks.",

The Wigner Crystal phase, characterized by the formation of a lattice of localized electron positions due to the repulsive interactions, is observed at low temperatures.As the temperature increases, the Wigner Crystal undergoes a phase transition to the BCDW state.

        "text": "On the freezing of variables in random constraint satisfaction problemsAbstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are a fundamental class of computational problems with a wide range of applications. A common approach to solving CSPs is to use a local search algorithm, which iteratively modifies a given solution until a solution satisfying all constraints is found. A key challenge in designing a local search algorithm for CSPs is to decide which variables to modify at each iteration. A promising approach is to freeze some of the variables and only modify the remaining variables. However, it is not known how to choose the variables to freeze in order to maximize the efficiency of the local search algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new method for freezing variables in random CSPs. Our method is based on the idea of identifying the variables that are most likely to be involved in conflicts during the search process. We show that our method can significantly improve the efficiency of local search algorithms for solving random CSPs.",

We combine deep optical and infrared data from the SWIRE, VVDS, and CFHTLS surveys to construct a large sample of galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.5<z<2.5 and stellar masses in the range 10^9-10^12 Msun.

We find that the star-forming sequence evolves significantly with redshift, becoming increasingly dominated by massive galaxies at later times. We also find evidence for a significant build-up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1. This build-up is driven by the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies, rather than by the passive evolution of quiescent galaxies. Our results are consistent with the scenario in which the red sequence is built up by the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies.

In section two, we demonstrate a novel approach for obtaining an information bound that holds for any quantum channel.

This paper investigates the effect of a fluctuating ultraviolet cutoff during inflation on the predicted power spectra.

The size of these corrections depends on properties of the cutoff fluctuations such as their frequency power spectrum.

The SZ effect causes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation to be distorted as it passes through the hot gas surrounding a cluster. By measuring the temperature and polarization of the CMB, we can infer the presence of a cluster and even measure its mass. However, the SZ effect is not a direct measure of the cluster's mass, but rather a proxy that is calibrated using simulations or observations of nearby clusters.In this paper, we present a new method for calibrating the SZ effect using a fundamental plane of galaxy clusters. The fundamental plane is a tight correlation between the cluster's mass, size, and temperature. By using this plane, we can calibrate the SZ effect and measure the mass of clusters with high accuracy and low scatter. We demonstrate the power of our method using a sample of 50 galaxy clusters from the SZ cluster catalog. Our results show that the fundamental plane provides a robust calibration of the SZ effect, allowing us to measure cluster masses with an uncertainty of less than 10%. We also show that our method is less susceptible to systematic errors than traditional calibration methods.Our work provides a significant improvement in the accuracy and precision of SZ-based cluster mass measurements. This will enable better constraints on cosmological models and cluster formation theories. Moreover, our method can be easily applied to future SZ surveys, such as the CMB-S4, which will provide an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected clusters.

For over fifteen years, astronomers have been using high resolution radio imaging techniques to observe the remnant of this supernova. In this time period, the morphology of the expanding remnant has transitioned from a ring-like structure to an irregular shape. These long-term observations have provided insights into the dissipation of the ejecta and the interaction between the expanding material and the progenitor star's circumstellar medium. Recent radio images show that the forward shock is now encountering denser regions likely created by the progenitor star's winds prior to explosion. Models suggest we are witnessing the transition from an early ejecta-dominated phase to a later Sedov-Taylor phase driven by the explosion's kinetic energy. Detailed mapping of localized enhancements in the remnant's radio emission have also revealed asymmetries in the pre-supernova mass loss. Continued monitoring in the coming years will track the remnant's evolution further into the Sedov phase and provide a unprecedented look at supernova hydrodynamics over decades.",

Four syntactic structures are examined - subjects, objects, modifiers and coordination - based on their connectivity patterns and statistical properties. Network statistics such as average path length, clustering coefficient and assortativity are computed to characterize the topology of each syntactic structure. The analysis finds evidence that subject and object networks exhibited small-world properties during the early period while modifier and coordination networks transitioned from small-world to scale-freeover time. Structural criteria are also evaluated including network diameter, modular structure and hierarchical organization. The study contributes new insights into the evolution of syntactic complexity in early English and establishes network science as an effective approach for conducting large-scale syntax analyses.

This paper presents a possible solution to this century-old problem through binary mass transfer and merger events. Using detailed stellar evolution and binary population synthesis codes, we model the effect of a lower-main sequence companion accreting material from an evolved AGB primary. Our simulations show that the accreted material can become mixed into the secondary star's envelope, triggering a thermal pulse that mixes carbon to the surface. This process naturally produces stars with sub-solar C/O ratios for a brief period. We find our binary merger models can account for the observed ratios and numbers of early R-type carbon stars seen in stellar populations. This binary-merger scenario provides the first potentially viable solution for explaining the anomalous chemical signatures of these problem objects.

Phase transitions are ubiquitous phenomena occurring in various systems, and noise can significantly influence the emergence and characteristics of these transitions. However, the role of noise statistics and spectrum in driving phase transitions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we employed a theoretical framework based on stochastic differential equations to model the dynamics of a generic system undergoing phase transitions under the influence of different noise statistics and spectra. Our results reveal that both the statistical properties and spectral characteristics of the applied noises exert profound effects on the occurrence, nature, and critical behavior of the phase transitions. Specifically, we find that deviations from Gaussian noise statistics lead to the modification of critical exponents and the emergence of unconventional transition phenomena. Moreover, by systematically varying the noise spectrum, we observe distinct regimes in which different transitions dominate. We demonstrate that the interplay between noise statistics and spectrum can lead to rich phase diagrams, exhibiting multiple transition points and regions of coexistence. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the nuanced interplay between noise properties and phase transitions, providing valuable insights into the role of noise in complex systems.

Our results indicate that the coupling between electronic excitations and lattice vibrations promotes the formation of Cooper pairs with opposite momentum, leading to the emergence of d-wave symmetry. Furthermore, we show that the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the specific band structure of the material play crucial roles in determining the superconducting properties. This work sheds light on the interplay between electron-phonon interactions and d-wave superconductivity, providing valuable insights for the design and discovery of novel high-temperature superconductors.",

Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we find that edge oxidation significantly enhances the half-metallicity of ZGNRs, leading to a larger spin polarization and a higher magnetic moment. The edge oxidation also introduces defects into the ZGNRs, which affects their electronic structure and magnetic properties. We observe that the edge-oxidized ZGNRs exhibit a unique electronic structure, characterized by a large gap at the Dirac points, which is absent in pristine ZGNRs. The enhanced half-metallicity in edge-oxidized ZGNRs makes them promising candidates for applications in spintronics and other emerging technologies. Finally, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities of using edge-oxidized ZGNRs in real-world applications.",

These outflows exhibit a range of velocities, suggesting variations in the launching mechanisms.

The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism indicates that there is a strong correlation between 5f electrons. In this paper, we report the results of the investigation on the itinerant to localized transition of 5f electrons in UPd2Al3 by means of muon spin relaxation (μSR). The temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate reveals a clear anomaly at TN, indicating a magnetic phase transition. The muon spin relaxation rate below TN is much larger than that above TN, suggesting the itinerant to localized transition of 5f electrons below TN. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate below TN gives a large internal field of 48 mT at the muon site. The electronic specific heat coefficient γ of UPd2Al3 is 145 mJ/(mol K2), which is much larger than that of typical heavy fermion superconductors.

The multiphilic descriptor introduced in this study integrates multiple dimensions of chemical interactions, including electronic, steric, and solvation effects. By considering these multiple factors simultaneously, the descriptor provides a more comprehensive view of reactivity and selectivity.

The descriptor is derived from a set of carefully selected molecular properties that capture the relevant features across different interaction types.The performance of the multiphilic descriptor is extensively evaluated using a diverse set of chemical reactions and selectivity scenarios. The results demonstrate its ability to predict reactivity trends and selectivity outcomes with high accuracy. The descriptor proves to be particularly effective in cases where traditional descriptors fail to provide satisfactory results.Furthermore, the multiphilic descriptor offers a systematic framework for analyzing and interpreting chemical reactivity and selectivity.

We propose a new method that leverages the properties of Brownian motion to identify the presence of two-sided alternatives. Our approach is based on the observation that Brownian motion can be characterized by a set of stochastic processes that have different statistical properties on different time scales. By analyzing these processes, we are able to detect the presence of two-sided alternatives with high accuracy.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a simulation study, where we compare the performance of our method to existing approaches. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.We also apply our method to a real-world example, using data from a financial market. Our results show that our method is able to detect the presence of two-sided alternatives in the data, which correspond to periods of high market volatility. We also find that our method is able to identify changes in market sentiment that are not captured by traditional statistical methods.Our findings have important implications for the study of financial markets and other complex systems. In particular, our method provides a new tool for identifying periods of high volatility and market instability, which can be used to inform investment decisions and risk management strategies. Additionally, our method demonstrates the potential of using machine learning techniques to analyze complex data sets and identify novel patterns and trends.Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for detecting two-sided alternatives in a Brownian motion model. Our approach has important implications for the study of complex systems and has the potential to be applied in a wide range of fields, including finance, biology, and physics.",

Guseinov and published in the journal Chemical Physics (Vol. 309, 2005). Guseinov's paper presents a mathematical derivation of the one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb interaction potential and its derivatives. These theorems are essential in various fields of physics and chemistry for understanding and calculating intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. We begin by providing an overview of Guseinov's approach and highlighting the significance of the derived addition theorems. We then proceed to critically evaluate the methodology employed by Guseinov, focusing on the assumptions made and the level of mathematical rigor applied. Our analysis reveals certain limitations and ambiguities in Guseinov's derivations, which may affect the accuracy and applicability of the derived theorems.Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these limitations and suggest potential improvements to enhance the validity and robustness of Guseinov's work. We recommend conducting additional numerical simulations and experimental validations to validate the derived theorems in various molecular systems. Moreover, alternative mathematical techniques could be explored to ascertain the completeness and generality of the presented addition theorems.Additionally, we address the broader scientific community by emphasizing the importance of accurate and reliable derivation of fundamental theorems, such as the one-range addition theorems for Coulomb interaction potential. These theorems serve as the foundation for many theoretical models and computational approaches, making it crucial to thoroughly scrutinize the derivations and ensure their correctness.",

By employing the appropriate parameters and considering the interplay of spin-dependent interactions and external magnetic fields, we explore the transport behavior through the double quantum dots. Our analysis reveals the emergence of spin-polarized current due to the spin-selective features of the system. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing the spin polarization efficiency, such as the dot-lead coupling strength and the relative energy alignment of the dots. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of spin transport in mesoscopic systems and can pave the way for the design of spintronic devices based on double quantum dot architectures.",

We introduce a new algorithm, called CCTP (Cooperative Coalition Transmission Protocol), that leverages cooperative game theory to allocate resources and schedule transmissions in a way that benefits all nodes in the network.Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CCTP significantly outperforms traditional selfish packet-forwarding protocols in terms of network throughput, delay, and fairness. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to changes in network topology and node behavior, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of wireless network scenarios.Our results provide a compelling case for the use of cooperative game theory in wireless network design, and highlight the potential benefits of coalition formation in mitigating the curse of boundary nodes. We believe that our approach has important implications for the future development of selfish packet-forwarding wireless networks, and represents a significant step towards realizing the full potential of these networks.",

According to the latest data released by the government, the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a rate greater than predicted by experts. The unexpected result can be attributed to several factors, including robust consumer spending and strong investment activity.During this period, India's GDP grew by a respectable 6.8%, surprising economists who had projected a slightly lower growth rate. The positive performance can be largely attributed to increased domestic demand, with consumer spending driving economic expansion. Additionally, the government's focus on infrastructure development and policies promoting investment played a crucial role in supporting growth.The data also showed encouraging signs for key sectors of the economy. Manufacturing and construction, in particular, experienced growth spurts, contributing significantly to the overall expansion. However, sluggish performance in the agricultural sector remained a concern, as it recorded a modest growth rate.As India continues to assert its presence as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, this better-than-expected economic performance reinforces the country's potential.

The rise in funeral costs, which is significantly higher than the overall inflation rate, adds pressure to families already grappling with the emotional and logistical challenges of arranging a loved one's final farewell.Experts suggest that various factors contribute to this sharp increase in funeral prices, including the rising costs of essential services, such as cremation or burial, professional fees, and the purchase of a coffin or casket.

Campaigners and advocacy groups are calling for increased transparency in funeral costs, urging the government and industry regulators to address the issue and provide support to grieving families who struggle to meet these financial burdens. The Welsh government is now under pressure to take action and explore options to mitigate the rising costs, ensuring that funerals remain accessible for all, regardless of income or socioeconomic status.With the cost of funerals continuing to rise, families are left grappling with difficult decisions, often resorting to cutting corners or accumulating debt to cover the expenses.

The court sentenced Yosef Haim Ben-David to life in prison plus 20 years, and a minor whose identity has been concealed to life imprisonment. According to the indictment, the two men kidnapped Abu Khdair from his neighborhood in East Jerusalem and burned him alive in a forest outside the city in retaliation for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teens. Prosecutors said they collected evidence showing the premeditated nature of the killing, including testimony from other youths and mobile phone location data that placed the defendants at the scene of the crime. Abu Khdair's death sparked widespread demonstrations across the Palestinian territories and stoked tensions in the lead up to the 2014 Gaza war. His family said the harsh sentences delivered a strong message about Israel's commitment to prosecuting Jewish extremists.",

This study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at a leading university, used advanced imaging techniques to monitor the brains of individuals who had taken cocaine. The results showed that the drug caused changes in the brain's reward system, specifically in the regions associated with pleasure and motivation. These changes were observed within hours of taking the drug and could be a sign of the brain's adaptation to the drug, which can eventually lead to addiction. The researchers believe that these findings could have important implications for the understanding and treatment of drug addiction. They plan to continue their research to better understand the long-term effects of cocaine use on the brain and to develop more effective interventions for addiction. The study's lead author noted that while the findings are concerning, they also highlight the brain's ability to adapt and change in response to external stimuli, which could be leveraged to develop new treatments for addiction.",

Dubbed \"Hastings Day,\" this proposed public holiday would fall on the 14th of October each year. The initiative behind the campaign is centered around commemorating the historic Battle of Hastings, a significant event that unfolded in 1066 and had a profound impact on the country's future.Advocates argue that introducing Hastings Day as a bank holiday would not only allow citizens to honor their national history but also provide an opportunity for cultural awareness and education. The Battle of Hastings, which marked the Norman conquest of England, is considered a pivotal moment in British history and shaped the nation's politics, language, and culture. Supporters highlight the potential for parades, reenactments, and educational programs to engage communities across the country.However, discussions surrounding the proposed bank holiday have also drawn attention to the economic implications. Critics raise concerns about the potential disruption to businesses and the wider economy, as an additional day off could entail financial costs. To address these concerns, proponents suggest that Hastings Day could be compensated for by reducing or redistributing existing bank holidays, ensuring a balanced approach that preserves business interests while still recognizing the historical significance of the Battle of Hastings.As the debate gains traction, the government finds itself faced with the task of weighing cultural significance against the economic impact. The decision on whether to introduce Hastings Day is expected to involve thorough consultations and evaluations, considering the interests of various stakeholders.",

As an experienced international with over 50 caps for Wales, Baldwin feels head coach Wayne Pivac has picked a roster with more versatility across the forwards and backs. \"I think there is a better blend of players in the squad this time who can cover multiple positions if needed,\" said Baldwin. The Dragons player recalled struggles Wales encountered in 2017 when narrow losses to the All Blacks and Springboks exposed a lack of depth in certain areas. However, Baldwin is encouraged by the squad's increased strength in depth across the pack as well as the backline options available to Pivac. “We have a lot more players who are comfortable playing in multiple positions if required,” Baldwin stated. With away matches in Pretoria and Bloemfontein, Wales will need to be competitive at set-piece and assert physical dominance against the World Cup champion Springboks. Baldwin believes the current squad selected is best equipped to meet those challenges compared to previous tours.The first of two Summer Tests is scheduled for July 2 in Pretoria, followed by the second international on July 9 in Bloemfontein. Baldwin will be hoping to feature and help Wales pull off what would be famous victories against the number one ranked Springboks on their home soil.

Despite the loss, Federer was pleased with his overall performance at the grass court Grand Slam tournament.\"It was an amazing event for me regardless of today's result,\" Federer said in his on-court interview after the match. \"I had some tough battles throughout the fortnight and was able to overcome some tough opponents.\" In reaching his 12th Wimbledon final, Federer became the oldest finalist at the championships in the open era. At his post-match press conference, Federer said he was proud of how he was able to play given his age. While disappointed not to win, Federer stated that he hoped his runner-up finish could be the start of more successes on tour going forward. \"I'm hoping that this will be a stepping stone for me,\" Federer said. \"I feel good physically and like I've got more tennis left in me.\"The 20-time Grand Slam champion acknowledged that defeating Djokovic on a surface like grass had become very difficult. However, Federer expressed optimism that he could still compete for major titles if he maintained his form. He next turns his attention to the American hard court swing in preparation for the US Open later this summer.Federer thanked his family, team and fans for their enduring support throughout his career. He pledged to keep working hard to give himself more chances to hoist Grand Slam trophies. Only time will tell if the Swiss maestro can add to his collection, but on the evidence of his Wimbledon performance, it would be unwise to rule Federer out.",

This development came as a surprise to industry experts who had anticipated a potential agreement to stabilize global oil supply. The failure to establish a production limit highlights the ongoing challenges faced by OPEC in managing the delicate balance between supply and demand.Despite the lack of a formal agreement, market sentiments seemed relatively unfazed, leading to a marginal increase in oil prices. Traders and investors closely monitored the outcome of the meeting, hoping for a decision that would have a significant impact on global oil markets. However, the absence of a unified stance among OPEC members suggests the prevalent divisions and competing interests within the organization.It remains to be seen how this inconclusive meeting will influence the future trajectory of oil prices. While the slight uptick in prices may offer temporary relief to oil-producing nations, it also raises concerns about the potential for increased volatility in the market. With no immediate cap on production levels, the industry will continue to operate without strict limits, leaving room for uncertainty and potential fluctuations in the coming months.Analysts emphasize that efforts to stabilize oil markets will require much-needed cooperation and consensus-building within the OPEC group. As global demand for oil remains a crucial driver of economic growth and sustainability, the ability to strike a balance in production levels becomes increasingly vital. The next scheduled OPEC meeting will undoubtedly be closely watched, as investors and oil-dependent economies eagerly await a more definitive outcome in the ongoing quest for stability in the oil industry.",

This innovative method aims to identify the culprits and hold them accountable for their actions. The local council has not ruled out implementing the unconventional practice, which involves analyzing the genetic material present in dog feces to pinpoint the responsible pet and owner.The growing concern over the town's cleanliness prompted this unique approach, as traditional enforcement and education techniques have proven ineffective in curbing the problem. By resorting to DNA testing, authorities could establish a reliable and indisputable connection between the evidence left behind and the specific dog owner responsible.Although critics argue that this method may seem extreme or invasive, proponents argue that it is a necessary step to encourage responsible pet ownership and improve the overall cleanliness of the town. Dog owners, too, have expressed mixed reactions, with some welcoming the measure as a way to distinguish responsible owners from the negligent ones.If implemented, dog owners within the town could face mandatory registration of their pets' DNA, which would be compared to samples of stray feces found on the streets. Matching results would allow the authorities to identify offenders and impose appropriate penalties, such as fines or required attendance at pet responsibility courses.While the utilization of DNA testing in such a manner is a relatively novel concept, similar initiatives have been successfully implemented in other parts of the world, resulting in significant reductions in dog waste pollution. If adopted, this approach could pave the way for other communities grappling with similar challenges to follow suit.",

The dynamic playmaker, renowned for his lightning-fast passes and exceptional game sense, has been diligently working on his recovery, supporting hopes of a swift return to top form.Webb's injury, which had raised concerns among teammates and supporters alike, had left the talented scrum-half uncertain about his prospects of participating in the pinnacle event of European rugby. However, his recent progress and positive response to treatment have bolstered his chances of donning the Welsh jersey once again.With the Six Nations just around the corner, the timing could not be more perfect for Webb. As one of Wales' most influential and experienced players, his skill set and leadership qualities have been sorely missed. During his previous Six Nations appearances, Webb's uncanny ability to control the pace of the game and make clinical decisions on the field proved instrumental in Wales' success.While every effort will be made to ensure his full recovery, the Welsh team management remain cautious not to rush Webb's return prematurely. The scrum-half's fitness will be closely monitored, and the final decision on his involvement in the tournament will be based on expert medical advice and his own well-being.As Webb enters the latter stages of his recovery, Wales and Ospreys supporters are eagerly anticipating his potential return to action. With his infectious determination and innate ability to influence matches on a grand scale, Webb's comeback could be the perfect catalyst for Wales' Six Nations campaign, igniting the hopes of fans nationwide.",

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. We find that the CO (1-0) emission line is generally a reliable tracer, exhibiting a strong correlation with the gas surface density derived from the Kennicutt-Schmidt laws. Our analysis reveals significant variations in the molecular gas tracers' effectiveness in estimating the total gas content of galaxies.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. We show that collisions have a significant impact on the cascade dynamics, leading to a diverse range of phenomena, including collisional dissipation, the formation of coherent structures, and the modification of the energy transfer across scales.Our findings provide valuable insights into the understanding of astrophysical turbulence and have implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena and plasma-based technologies. In the kinetic regime, small-scale turbulent fluctuations are generated by the resonant interactions between particles and waves, leading to the transfer of energy to larger scales through an inverse cascade.

We show that thenumber of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly onthe signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a youngpopulation. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recoverbetween 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPAand our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.",

During theobservations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb. The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. Thisis most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distributionvariations, most probably caused by strong flickering.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. The removal of low-mass stars results in a loss of dynamical heating sources, which slows down the cluster's expansion over time. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

However, wesee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar massor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, aswould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based uponphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,accretion-heating-driven annealing at r < 1 AU, or spiral-shock heating at r <10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either anothergrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must beat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce.

Furthermore, we observe a correlation between the proximity-induced hardness enhancements and the properties of the absorbers, such as their redshift, column density, and metallicity.To gain further insights into the physical mechanisms driving the observed spectral hardness variations, we compare our results with theoretical models and numerical simulations.

We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations.

We find that introducing rewiring mechanisms can facilitate the spread of cooperation and enhance the population's overall welfare.

For a particular choice of the background gauge, we derive the explicit expressions for the first order differential equations in the presence of marginal deformations. We solve these equations in the small deformation limit and show that there exists an exact solution to all the orders of string perturbation theory for which the background metric is flat and the dilaton is constant.

Most of the crystals investigated are elemental(e.g., germanium) or binary (e.g., gallium nitride) semiconductors. The initialelectronic calculations were performed in the local density approximation anddid not include spin-orbit interaction. Agreement between experimental andcalculated results was usually found to be good, except for crystals containingheavy atoms (e.g., PbS) for which discrepancies of the order of 20% existed atthe low temperature maximum found for $C/T^3$. It has been conjectured thatthis discrepancies result from the neglect of spin-orbit interaction which islarge for heavy atoms ($\\Delta_0\\sim$1.3eV for the $p$ valence electrons ofatomic lead). Here we discuss measurements and \\textit{ab initio} calculationsof $C(T)$ for crystalline bismuth ($\\Delta_0\\sim$1.7 eV), strictly speaking asemimetal but in the temperature region accessible to us ($T >$ 2K) acting as asemiconductor. This behavior is explained by the fact that the SOI causes the energy bands of bismuth to become more dispersive, which leads to a higher density of states at the Fermi level.Our results are in good agreement with experimental data, and they provide a better understanding of the role of the SOI in the thermodynamic properties of crystals. We find that the SOI has a significant effect on the specific heat, leading to a decrease in the specific heat at low temperatures and an increase in the specific heat at high temperatures.

Data mining researchhas made much effort to apply various mining algorithms efficiently on largedatabases. However, a serious problem in their practical application is thelong processing time of such algorithms. Nowadays, one of the key challenges isto integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional databasesystems. Indeed, such implementations can take advantage of the efficiencyprovided by SQL engines. In this paper, we propose an integrating approach fordecision trees within a classical database system. However, decision trees can be sensitive to noise and outliers in the data, and they can be difficult to scale to large datasets.In this paper, we propose a new decision tree modeling algorithm that uses relational views. Our algorithm is also more interpretable than traditional decision tree algorithms, making it a valuable tool for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Each view corresponds to a givenpopulation in the underlying decision tree. We selected the classical InductionDecision Tree (ID3) algorithm to build the decision tree. To prove that ourimplementation of ID3 works properly, we successfully compared the output ofour procedure with the output of an existing and validated data miningsoftware, SIPINA. **Keywords:** Decision trees, relational views, machine learning, classification, regression",

Our construction is based in part on the conjecture that theDvali-Shifman mechanism for dynamically localising gauge bosons works correctlyin 4+1-d. Assuming this to be so, we require the gauge symmetry to be SU(5)inthe bulk, spontaneously breaking to SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) inside the domain wall,thus dynamically localising the standard model gauge bosons provided that theSU(5) theory in the bulk exhibits confinement. The wall is created jointly by areal singlet-Higgs field eta configured as a kink, and an SU(5) adjoint-Higgsfield chi that takes nonzero values inside the wall. Chiral 3+1-dimensionalquarks and leptons are confined and split along the bulk direction via theirYukawa couplings to eta and chi. The model also predicts the existence of a new scalar boson with a mass in the range 250–300 GeV. For example, the model predicts the existence of a light Higgs boson with a mass in the range 125–127 GeV, in agreement with the recent LHC data.

We find that Advanced LIGO is sensitive to BBH MACHOs with total masses up to ~10^6 Msun and mass ratios down to ~10^-3. We then use a matched filtering technique to search for the gravitational wave signal from the population of BBH MACHOs in data from the Advanced LIGO detectors. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the formation of PM2.5 and its chemical composition during high-pollution episodes in urban areas. The results show that high-pollution episodes in the GTA are characterized by high concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and their precursors, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia (NH3). However, the impact of thethermodynamic equilibrium assumption is limited. The impact of heterogeneousreactions is large for nitrate and ammonium, and taking heterogeneous reactionsinto account appears to be crucial in predicting the peaks of nitrate andammonium. The impact of deposition is the same for all inorganic PM2.5. The aerosol particles are mainly composed of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organic matter.

A great advantage of this scheme is that of beingformulated in terms of localized orbitals and thus it requires very fewcomputational resources and times. Our formulation provides a unified description of the dielectric response of semiconductor nanocrystals that is valid for both the weak and strong confinement regimes. We also show that the generalized dielectric constant can be used to calculate the dielectric constant of semiconductor nanocrystals in an external electric field. Our calculations indicatethat the continuum dielectric model, used in conjunction with a size dependentdielectric constant, underestimates the nanocrystal polarizability, leading toexceedingly strong surface polarization fields.",

In this theory, the graviton becomes massive when general covarianceis spontaneously broken through the introduction of a field that links twometrics, one of the which will eventually decouple. The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. Graviton propagator in a covariant massive gravity theory is formulated by using the background field method in the Stückelberg formalism.By solving the linearized equation of motion of the graviton around the maximally symmetric background, we derive the graviton propagator in the covariant massive gravity theory at the one-loop level.We show that the graviton propagator has two poles corresponding to the massive graviton and the massless graviton which are the longitudinal and the transverse mode of the graviton, respectively.We compare our result with that in the Stückelberg formalism where the graviton propagator possesses a single pole.We also compute the correction to the potential due to the loop diagrams with graviton and massive graviton exchanges which is necessary to construct an effective action in a covariant massive gravity theory.We show that the graviton and massive graviton contributions are canceled out so that the potential in the covariant massive gravity theory is the same as that in the Stückelberg formalism. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks.

Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. Our results show that gene duplications often lead to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the encoded transcription factors and rewiring of regulatory interactions. We analyze how network structure and functionality changes in response to selective pressures on gene expression levels after duplications. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes.

In this paper we attempt to apply the same methods to other classes ofgroups. A fundamental new problem is that the Stallings folding algorithm mustbe modified to allow for ``sewing'' on relations of non-free groups. This includes analyzing cyclic and dihedral subgroups. The graph folding approach yields fresh insights into these subgroup families. We present an algorithm to compute such afinite automaton and use it to solve various algorithmic problems.",

A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usualuniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing twodirectors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. Increasing disparity in aspect ratios between the two particle shapes strengthened the orientational ordering and lowered the critical packing fraction needed for demixing. Our findings provide insight into self-assembly of anisotropic colloids and may inform design of novel composite materials. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamicalsimulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. Thediffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. This enhancement is attributed to the turbulent transport of chemical species from the surrounding environment into the cloud, as well as the promoted mixing of species within the cloud.The increased concentration of chemical species within diffuse clouds has important implications for their role in the Earth's climate system. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. In this study, we investigate the effects of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry of diffuse clouds, using a combination of field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations.Our results show that turbulent diffusion leads to a significant increase in the concentration of chemical species within diffuse clouds, particularly in the vicinity of cloud edges. The inclusion of these effects will improve the accuracy of these models, enabling a better understanding of the complex interactions between the Earth's atmosphere, climate, and weather patterns. For example, the enhancement of chemical species concentration is more pronounced in clouds formed in regions with high levels of atmospheric pollution, and in clouds with high liquid water content.Our study highlights the importance of considering the effects of turbulent diffusion in the development of climate models and atmospheric chemistry predictions. Turbulent diffusion can be thesource of additional molecular production and should be included in chemicalmodels of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for theinterpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formationand presence of H$_3^+$.",

We use the electric drift approximation,valid for low-density plasmas. We linearise the coupled relativistic cold-fluid and Maxwell equations in theelectric drift approximation. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for theperturbed azimuthal electric field is solved numerically with standard technicsfor boundary value problems like the shooting method.

The research presented in this article contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between electromagnetic fields, plasmas, and gravity in pulsars and other astrophysical systems. The relativistic corrections lead to a stabilization of the instability, mitigating its impact on the pulsar's radiation and particle acceleration. As expected, when the relativistic andelectromagnetic effects become significant, the diocotron instability tends tostabilise.

However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Our results suggest that the advective-acoustic cycle can have a significant impact on the neutrino signal and the nucleosynthesis process in the supernova. We find that the advective-acoustic cycle, which involves the interaction between fluid advection and acoustic waves, is an important mechanism for energy transport in the supernova core. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylarassures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and themetallized surface (3) of the mylar.

By carefully controlling the experimental conditions, we are able to extract precise measurements of the Cooper pair mass and mobility. Our results provide valuable information for understanding the behavior of Cooper pairs in superconductors and have important implications for the development of superconducting devices.

It has beenthen stated that this implies that either locally dark matter is notdistributed in the same way as luminous matter, or peculiar velocities are notdue to fluctuations in mass. To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LGenvironment. Future studies will focus on exploring the implications of these results for our understanding of the universe as a whole, and for the development of new observational and theoretical tools for studying the local universe. The galaxy populations within the Local Volume show a range of kinematic properties, including both ordered and disordered motion. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models. The main conclusion is that the lack ofcorrelation between the local gravitation and the peculiar velocity fieldsaround LG-like objects is naturally expected in the CDM cosmologies.",

Environmental effects are studied through asmoothed density field (normalized with random catalogs with the same surveyedges and redshift selection function) and the distance to the nearest cluster(R/r200, where r200 is the virial radius, whose relation to the aperturevelocity dispersion is quantified). The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K isanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlatedwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10xless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness inthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of galaxies in dense environments and the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties. This mechanism removes gas from the galaxies, truncating their star formation and suppressing their radio emission. Weanalytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies withinSSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapidgalaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced rampressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 mergingclusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.",

The light curves ofHS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min andpeak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,respectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from areflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocitystudy confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. Amodel atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimumlight provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun andTwd=~70000-100000 K, respectively. Due to their high accretion rates, P CVs are also potential sources of gravitational wave radiation, making them important targets for study in the era of gravitational wave astronomy.Observations of HS1857+5144 have also revealed a variety of puzzling features, including an observed lack of irradiation effects and radiation from the companion star. The system's youth and high mass transfer rate make it an exciting object for further study, as it provides insight into the early stages of cataclysmic variable evolution. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngestpre-CV known to date.

He's done a great job for us, after moving straight from a player to backs coach when Shane Howarth left. \"Young continued: \"There were two options. Under Blackett's stewardship, the team has witnessed considerable growth, and their upward trajectory is a testament to the impact he has had on the club.Blackett's move to Wasps has sparked discussions within the rugby community, with experts and fans alike speculating on the potential impact he will have on his new team. The respected coach has played a pivotal role in elevating Rotherham's performance and transforming them into a formidable force in the league.Blackett's move to Wasps marks an exciting opportunity to further enhance his coaching career on the elite stage of English rugby. \"The vastly experienced option was a non-starter really, simply because there is no one of that level on the market at the moment, so we decided to look at the most promising young coaches coming through. \"Lee has impressed knowledgeable onlookers by his attention to detail, enthusiasm and professionalism and his proven ability to get the best out of the players he coaches.\"",

The film's popularity underscores the growing influence of streaming platforms in shaping the landscape of modern cinema.As Netflix continues to invest in diverse and impactful storytelling, Sarandos anticipates the company's continued success in captivating audiences worldwide, and he looks forward to future projects that challenge societal norms and promote meaningful conversations. \"Netflix has 69 million monthly subscribers, 43 million of which are in the US, in more than 50 countries around the world.Sarandos said there were no plans to increase the number of screens showing Beasts of No Nation in the US.However, he said Netflix was planning to release the film theatrically in Africa, in Ghana and Nigeria. \"Netflix is not there, and obviously the film is of local importance, so we're doing that as well,\" he said.Beasts of No Nation was released in the UK on ten screens to make it eligible for the British film award season.",

The news is likely to be welcomed by businesses, who will be able to keep their costs down. \"Not all recent surveys back up the CIPD's view. Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Improvements in diagnosis and treatment are thought to be the reason.The death rate for men fell 12% and for women by 8%, narrowing the gender gap.But the actual number of cancer deaths rose - from 155,000 in 2003 to 162,000 in 2013 - as more people live longer and develop the disease in old age. \"The population is growing, and more of us are living longer,\" Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar said.Almost half of all the cancer deaths in 2013 were from lung, bowel, breast or prostate cancer.Although the combined death rate for these four cancers had dropped by about 11% over the past 10 years, some other cancers, such as liver and pancreatic, had increased death rates.Sir Harpal said: \"Too many people are still being diagnosed with and dying from cancer, not just here in the UK but around the world. \"He said CRUK was focusing research on how to achieve earlier diagnosis and manage hard-to-treat cancers. \"Our scientists are developing new tests, surgical and radiotherapy techniques, and drugs,\" he said. **Cancer death rates drop in UK**Cancer death rates in the UK have fallen by about 10% in the past 10 years, according to the latest figures.The decline is being attributed to a number of factors, including earlier diagnosis, better treatments and increased awareness of the importance of healthy living.Cancer Research UK said the figures were \"encouraging\" but warned that more needed to be done to tackle the disease.The charity said that around 166,000 people die from cancer in the UK each year and that the number of new cases is rising.It called for more investment in research to find new and better treatments, as well as measures to prevent people from getting cancer in the first place.The government said it was committed to tackling cancer and that it was investing £1.3 billion in cancer research over the next five years.It said that it was also working to improve early diagnosis and access to treatment.The decline in cancer death rates is a welcome development, but there is still much work to be done to beat the disease. \"Cancer Research UK compiled the cancer death rate data, which was taken from cancer registries in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",

I have confidence with both. \"We would like to keep Joe, but we can't afford to buy him,\" Mihajlovic said.",

I'm happier than I have ever been. **1Xtra DJ, Claira Hermet, has undergone a double mastectomy. \"She feels huge gratitude to those who looked after her: \"I want to say thank-you to surgeon, Tibor Kovas, and his team at Guy's Hospital for doing such a great job. \"My journey doesn't end here, it starts,\" she says. \"I will be working more with the charities Genesis and Breakthrough Breast Cancer to raise money, awareness and to help women who are planning the same procedure,\" she ends.Claira will be the focus of a documentary for BBC Radio 1 Stories, due to be broadcast later this month.Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use a tax avoidance scheme is a personal one. Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

His determination and cooperation played a crucial role in the success of the surgery.Once all the teeth were removed successfully, the surgical team performed reconstructive procedures to repair the boy's jaws and restore his oral functionality. The team was led by Dr Vandana Thorawade who heads the hospital's ENT (ear, nose and throat) department. Ashik now has 28 teeth.Describing Ashik's case as \"very rare\", Dr Dhiware said she had \"not seen anything like this before in my 30-year career\", but said she was \"thrilled to get such an exciting case\". \"According to medical literature available on the condition, it is known to affect the upper jaw and a maximum of 37 teeth have been extracted from the tumour in the past. Dr. Praveen Kumar Tripathi, the lead surgeon of the operation, described the case as unique and challenging.The patient, a resident of Nagpur, Maharashtra, had been experiencing severe pain and swelling in his jaws for several months. \"Ashik's father Suresh Gavai was quoted by the Mumbai Mirror as saying that his son complained of severe pain a month ago. \"I was worried that it may turn out to be cancer so I brought him to Mumbai,\" he said.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. However, the station will need to make some significant changes if it wants to remain one of the UK's most popular radio stations. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

The decision to discontinue the show's reruns reflects ZDF's dedication to preserving historical accuracy and promoting transparency.The revelation of the actor's Waffen SS past has sparked discussions about the importance of confronting and acknowledging historical wrongdoings. The broadcaster acknowledges the seriousness of the revelation and aims to maintain the trust of its audience by addressing such issues proactively.While the late actor's past associations have come to light, ZDF recognizes the significance of confronting historical truths and the need for accountability. In 2006, another famous German, the novelist Guenther Grass, caused consternation when he revealed that he had served as a member of the Waffen SS.",

Some said they could not be bothered, while others were afraid of intimidation or embarrassed.A new guide to help students avoid being overcharged contains tips on how to take a meter reading, shopping around to get the best utility deals,  querying high bills and how to report faults, keep records of conversations and complain.Broadband packages are another minefield, says the guide, so students are advised to check the length of contracts, whether they are transferable, and to be aware of any limits on the amount of data they can download - even with so-called \"unlimited\" deals.To avoid losing deposits for damage caused by previous tenants, they are advised to check tenancy agreements and take inventories and photographs when they first move in. \"We want to ensure that all students are able to stand up for their rights and speak out when things go wrong, whether that is being asked to pay for a bill from a previous tenant or paying for damage they did not do,\" said Mr Shand Smith. As costs of living continue to rise, it is more important than ever for students to be informed about consumer rights so they aren't taken advantage of financially during their studies.",

One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. His family said the harsh sentences delivered a strong message about Israel's commitment to prosecuting Jewish extremists. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act. \"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Arresting officers recovered class A drugs, £10,000 in cash and mobile phones which linked Hussain as the ringleader.Elba appeared in the long-running US TV crime drama between 2002 and 2004, which saw his character Bell become a major player in a drug dealing network in Baltimore.PC David Harman, financial investigator at West Midlands Police, said messages on Hussain's phones showed texts to drug users boasting about the quality of the drugs, advice to runners about how to boost sales and demands for sales figures. \"Hussain had been studying small business management, similar to Idris Elba's character Stringer Bell in TV's The Wire, and course books were found inside the flat,\" he said. This development comes as a significant victory in the fight against drug-related crime and serves as a warning to others involved in such activities. \"The recovery team began investigating Hussain following his jailing last December after admitting conspiring to sell drugs. \"They discovered that cash deposits were passed through a company controlled by Hussain − which claimed to sell toilet rolls and bin bags - and he still held assets worth £38,000,\" a police spokesman said.Following a Proceeds of Crime hearing at the same court last Thursday, he was ordered to pay that money back.",

Like-for-like revenues rose 2.7%.Chief executive Jill McDonald said Halfords had gained market share in both motoring and cycling. \"Profit performance for the year was impacted by the weaker pound but our plans are well developed and I am confident this will be offset over time,\" she said.It is the last set of results to be presented by Ms McDonald before she joins Marks & Spencer as head of non-food in September.Chairman Dennis Millard said Ms McDonald was leaving a \"strong team and a clear direction to drive future growth\".Halfords said higher import costs had largely been responsible for the drop in profits.It said a late Easter knocked recent sales, revealing a 1.2% drop in like-for-like retail sales in the final three months of its financial year.Taking the 15 weeks to 28 April 2017, which includes Easter, it said like-for-like sales were 3.9% higher.Ms McDonald said the company was in a \"position of strength\" despite \"uncertainty\" about consumer spending due to rising inflation.Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the focus on premium cycling brands was working, buoyed by the fact Halfords expects growth in cycling of 3-5% per annum in the medium term. However, it cautioned that the ongoing volatility in currency markets may continue to pose a challenge in the near future. \"Staycations might help, as will the focus on higher value bikes.

Also there will be questions around the transport infrastructure in the area as well. \"I'm always keen for people to think of the local area when it comes to the possibility for more employment... but it's got to be sensitive and in keeping with the area and it has to have a strong level of local support for me.

NGC 1904 is known as a dense and ancient cluster residing in the Milky Way galaxy, making it an ideal candidate for investigating stellar evolution and dynamical processes. We combine multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic data obtained from ground-based and space-based observatories to probe the properties and origins of blue stragglers within NGC 1904. Our analysis reveals a significant population of blue stragglers in the cluster, characterized by stars with higher luminosity and bluer color than the main sequence turnoff. We further investigate the spatial distribution of blue stragglers and find evidence for mass segregation effects, indicating that these stars might have preferentially formed through stellar collisions or binary interactions. Additionally, we explore the correlation between the number of blue stragglers and the cluster's structural parameters, such as its age, metallicity, and core density, shedding light on the interplay between stellar dynamics and cluster properties. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the formation mechanisms and dynamical processes governing the blue straggler population within NGC 1904, contributing to our understanding of stellar evolution in globular clusters.",

The folding of proteins into intricate three-dimensional structures plays a fundamental role in their function and evolution. This article aims to explore the significance of intricate knots in proteins and their impact on protein function and evolutionary processes.Knots in proteins refer to specific conformations where the polypeptide chain passes through itself, forming a closed loop. Recent studies have identified a diverse range of knot types in protein structures, highlighting their prevalence and potential functional importance. Understanding the functional implications of knots in proteins is of great interest, as it offers insights into the stability, flexibility, and activity of these biomolecules.Various knot types have been associated with specific biological functions, such as enzymatic activity, molecular recognition, and protein-protein interactions. The presence of knots can confer structural stability, prevent unfolding, and influence catalytic efficiency. Additionally, knotting patterns can modulate protein dynamics, altering conformational changes and signaling cascades.Evolutionary perspectives on protein knots suggest that these intricate topologies can arise from both genetic and environmental factors. Evolutionary pressure may select for knotted proteins due to their advantageous properties, while mutational events and environmental conditions can induce knot formation or unravel existing knots.This article also discusses the challenges in experimentally studying protein knots and the methods employed to identify and characterize them. Structural biology techniques combined with computational approaches have proven instrumental in unraveling the complexity of knotted proteins and their functional significance.In conclusion, the study of intricate knots in proteins sheds light on their functional relevance and evolutionary implications.",

The goal of this research is to investigate the properties and characteristics of these sources at the lower frequency, revealing potential changes in their spectral behavior across different radio bands.The observations were conducted using an array of VLBI telescopes, including those belonging to the international network of radio telescopes. Extensive data calibration and reduction procedures were applied to obtain accurate flux density measurements and obtain high-quality images. The derived radio properties, such as total flux density, angular size, and position, were compared and analyzed in the context of the sources' spectral behavior.The results reveal a variety of behaviors among the studied nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources when observed at 1.6 GHz.

The phantom cosmology paradigm has gained substantial attention due to its ability to explain the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion. By incorporating a conformal coupling between the scalar field and gravity, the model introduces a dynamical time-varying cosmological constant, commonly referred to as Lambda. The authors employ a theoretical framework that incorporates both classical and quantum aspects, combining the Friedmann equations with the effective action from quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Through detailed calculations and analysis, they investigate the behavior of the cosmological dynamics in the presence of the conformal coupling. Their findings reveal that the conformal coupling plays a crucial role in determining the evolution of Lambda, which leads to interesting consequences for the overall evolution of the universe. Specifically, they uncover a particular route to Lambda that emerges in the conformally coupled phantom cosmology, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern the cosmological constant's dynamics. Furthermore, the authors discuss the implications of this route to Lambda on the cosmic expansion and accelerating nature of the universe. The results suggest that the conformal coupling can potentially explain the observed acceleration without invoking the existence of a fundamental cosmological constant. This study presents a significant step towards a deeper understanding of Lambda and its relation to conformal coupling in the context of phantom cosmology, contributing to the broader field of cosmological research.",

The deformation is found to arise from the interplay between the confinement potential and the repulsive electron-electron interactions, leading to a distortion of the crystal lattice. The electronic properties of the deformed Wigner crystal are also analyzed, unveiling intriguing features such as energy gaps and localized electronic states within the crystal structure.Furthermore, the article investigates the effect of various parameters such as dot size and electron density on the deformation and electronic properties of the Wigner crystal. It is found that both the dot size and the electron density strongly influence the degree of deformation and the energy spectrum of the crystal. Additionally, a phase diagram is constructed to illustrate the different regimes of the deformed Wigner crystal as a function of these parameters.The findings of this study shed light on the behavior of Wigner crystals in low-dimensional systems and provide valuable insights into the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. The insights gained from this research contribute to the understanding of exotic electronic phenomena in quantum dots and pave the way for potential applications in nanoscale devices and quantum computing.",

In this game, one player (the Proposer) is given a sum of money and asked to divide it with another player (the Responder). The Responder can either accept or reject the offer. If the Responder accepts, both players receive the money according to the proposed division. If the Responder rejects, both players receive nothing.In this paper, we study the evolutionary dynamics of the Ultimatum Game. We consider a population of players who play the game repeatedly and use a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for both the Proposer and the Responder. We find that the strategies that evolve are highly dependent on the initial conditions of the population. For example, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a fair split of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more cooperative. However, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a very unfair split of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more selfish.Our results suggest that the evolution of behavior in the Ultimatum Game is a complex and dynamic process. The strategies that evolve depend not only on the payoff structure of the game, but also on the initial conditions of the population.",

The source was discovered in the XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalogue and shows a very hard X-ray spectrum that can be well described by a power-law continuum plus a relativistically blurred reflection component. The primary continuum is likely to be produced by Comptonisation in a hot corona, while the reflection component is likely to be produced by reprocessing of the primary X-rays by the accretion disc. The reflection spectrum shows a number of interesting features, including a broad iron K$\\alpha$ emission line and a Compton hump. The equivalent width of the iron line is consistent with that of other radio-quiet quasars, but the Compton hump is significantly weaker than in most other sources. This suggests that the corona in RBS1423 is optically thin, and that the accretion disc is highly ionised. The overall X-ray properties of RBS1423 are similar to those of other radio-quiet quasars, but the weakness of the Compton hump is unusual.

Recent observations, including those of structured jets and a high magnetization of the outflows, imply that the jet launching mechanism might be more complex than previously thought. We investigate how a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, can drive collimated outflows that are consistent with the observational properties of GRBs.Methods:We perform axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which a rapidly rotating magnetar is embedded in a stellar envelope. We systematically vary the properties of the magnetar (magnetic field strength and rotation period) and the stellar envelope (density profile and rotation rate) to study the resulting outflow properties.Results:Our simulations show that magnetar-driven bubbles can indeed produce collimated outflows with Lorentz factors of a few tens to hundreds. The outflow Lorentz factor increases with the strength of the magnetar magnetic field, while it decreases with increasing rotation period of the magnetar and with increasing density of the stellar envelope.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra exhibit a broad emission band in the visible region, which is attributed to the radiative recombination of electrons from the conduction band to the defect states in the bandgap. The present study suggests that Co-doped ZnO NPs are promising materials for spintronics and optoelectronic applications.",

However, in most models, gauge mediation suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large masses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The strong dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses. This allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass. We also discuss the phenomenological implications of our model, including the dark matter candidate and the collider signatures.",

One approach, followed by Polyakov, is to use a path integral approach. This approach requires the specification of a world sheet action and a measure for the path integral. Polyakov proposed an action which is proportional to the area of the world sheet and a measure which is proportional to \\(exp(−S_P[X])\\), where \\(S_P\\) is the Polyakov action.This proposal, however, runs into difficulties when the string coupling becomes strong. This is because the exponential of the Polyakov action becomes large for large values of the string coupling, which makes the path integral ill-defined.One way to deal with this problem is to use a different action for the world sheet theory. A particularly interesting alternative action is the sigma model action, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the determinant of the induced metric on the world sheet.The sigma model action has a number of advantages over the Polyakov action. First, it is well-defined for all values of the string coupling. Second, it is conformally invariant, which means that it is invariant under changes of the metric on the world sheet. Third, it is related to string field theory, which is a perturbative approach to string theory.In this paper, we will study the sigma model action in the tensionless limit. This limit is obtained by taking the string tension to zero. In this limit, the sigma model action reduces to a two-dimensional topological field theory.We will show that the sigma model in the tensionless limit is equivalent to a particular two-dimensional topological field theory known as the Liouville theory.

The films were found to be ferromagnetic at room temperature, and the magnetic moment increased with increasing pO2.

The results show that the coronal hole had lower overall magnetic flux levels than the quiet region. Further analysis revealed that the magnetic flux was concentrated in smaller magnetic elements in the coronal hole compared to larger magnetic features in the quiet region. Statistical analysis of the magnetic flux density histograms for the two areas found them to have distinctly different profiles, with the coronal hole exhibiting a longer tail at lower flux densities. Potential field source surface modeling was also applied to extrapolate the magnetogram data out into the heliosphere. This allowed comparison of the open flux content between the two regions and provided insights into how their differing magnetic structures impact the generation of the fast and slow solar wind.

Using observations from the 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope of a sunspot, we measure oscillation properties such as period and power within several example penumbral filaments and compare them to the surrounding penumbra and quiet Sun. Preliminary results suggest the amplitude and power of p-mode oscillations may be reduced within some penumbral filaments, while the periods remain similar to the surroundings. This would indicate partial absorption of the p-mode waves rather than scattering. Further analysis is needed to improve signal-to-noise and statistically characterize any modifications across a larger sample of filaments.

Beginning with the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations, the dynamical evolution of the plasma is modeled numerically as it undergoes gravitational collapse. The results show how the inclusion of electromagnetic forces alters both the dynamics and end state of the collapse compared to purely gravitational scenarios. In particular, electromagnetic repulsion acts against gravitational attraction leading to slower collapse dynamics. Depending on the initial conditions, either a halted collapse state can form or collapse may continue until the formation of a charged electromagnetic compact object. Furthermore, electromagnetic field anomalies are shown to develop near the surface of the compact object.

Significant alignments were detected between multiple multipole vectors with l=2-5 and l=10-30 that are not expected from a statistically isotropic Gaussian random field. We also analyzed the signed-intensity of temperature fluctuations, i.e. whether hot or cold spots dominated on different scales.

In the first paper of this series, the rotation curve of the Milky Way was analyzed using stellar and gas kinematic tracers to constrain the distribution of dark matter in the galactic halo. This follow up study focuses specifically on using HI as a tracer to infer properties of the dark matter halo. High-resolution observations of HI emission from Milky Way galaxies provide an excellent tracer of the total gravitational potential as HI is dynamically cold and extended throughout the disk. A 3D HI emission cube of the Milky Way is compiled combining data from existing Milky Way HI surveys to construct the most complete map to date. The HI distribution is analyzed to derive the velocity field as a function of position.A parameterized model for the total gravitational potential is adopted including contributions from baryonic components like stars and gas as well as dark matter. The density profile and mass of the dark matter halo are free parameters which are varied to find the best fit model that reproduces the observed Hi velocity field. Additional constraints from stellar and gas kinematic tracers are also taken into account.The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space. The sampling explores a wide range of halo masses, density profiles, and halo shapes. The best fit halo is spherical with a virial mass of 0.8-1.2 ×1012 solar masses and a concentration parameter consistent with expectations from ΛCDM simulations.The analysis finds that the HI rotation curve provides strong independent constraints on the dark matter halo properties. The results are consistent with those of the first paper and help confirm the presence of a massive dark matter halo surrounding the Milky Way.",

This paper explores the concept of directed star arboricity as a theoretical bound on the number of edge-disjoint directed stars in a network. A directed star is defined as a root vertex with directed edges to leaves. We analyze the directed star arboricity of general directed graphs and establish computationally efficient algorithms to determine this property. By relating directed star arboricity to lightpath allocation in WDM networks, our work provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing network resource utilization. Specifically, we prove that the minimum number of wavelengths needed for any valid lightpath configuration in a WDM network is equal to the directed star arboricity of its underlying request graph.Through simulation on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms for computing directed star arboricity can be used to approximate the minimum number of wavelengths required. This provides insights to network operators on lightpath provisioning and wavelength assignment.In summary, this work establishes directed star arboricity as a useful graph-theoretic metric for the analysis of lightpath routing in WDM optical networks.

The simulations are performed using a pseudospectral method, and the results are analyzed using a wavelet-based technique.The study shows that the turbulence spectrum exhibits a power-law behavior with a slope that steepens with increasing time. The spectral index is found to depend on the plasma temperature and density, with higher temperatures and lower densities resulting in steeper spectra. The simulation also reveals the presence of a dissipation range at high wave numbers, which is attributed to the presence of small-scale turbulence.The study further investigates the effect of varying the plasma gradient scale on the turbulence spectrum. The results show that increasing the gradient scale leads to a shallower spectral index, indicating a shift towards larger-scale turbulence. Moreover, the study finds that the presence of a sheared magnetic field can significantly modify the turbulence spectrum, leading to a flatter slope and a broader spectral range.The article concludes by discussing the implications of the simulation results for the understanding of on-demand Langmuir turbulence in inhomogeneous plasmas.

The neutral gas distribution shows a marked gradient along the cluster's eastern edge, likely due to the presence of a nearby molecular cloud. The cluster's stellar population is found to be well-established, with a ages of 1-10 Myr. The absence of younger stars suggests that star formation in Westerlund 1 has slowed in recent times. We find evidence of a mass segregation, with the most massive stars concentrated towards the cluster center.

Firstly, the introduction of Dark Energy, a mysterious and unobserved form of energy, violates the fundamental principles of physics. Secondly, the arbitrary nature of Dark Energy's properties, such as its sudden appearance and unchanging density, undermines the scientific method and our ability to understand the universe. Thirdly, the reliance on Dark Energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe has stifled innovation and the development of alternative, more plausible theories. Fourthly, the focus on Dark Energy has distracted from the study of other cosmological phenomena, such as the nature of matter and the formation of galaxies. Fifthly, the promotion of Dark Energy has led to the suppression of debate and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints, damaging the scientific community's integrity. Sixthly, the acceptance of Dark Energy has resulted in a lack of investment in experiments and observations that could challenge its validity. Seventhly, the teaching of Dark Energy as established fact, rather than speculative theory, has misled a generation of students and limited their understanding of the universe. Finally, the persistence of the Dark Energy paradigm has contributed to a wider public disillusionment with science and its ability to provide meaningful answers to fundamental questions.

Villamayor's algorithm is a widely used method for computing the primary decomposition of a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring. While the algorithm's complexity has been well-studied in the exceptional monomial case, its complexity in the non exceptional monomial case has received less attention.We present a detailed analysis of the algorithm's complexity in the non exceptional monomial case, taking into account various factors such as the number of variables, the degree of the ideal, and the coefficient matrix. Our results show that the algorithm's complexity can vary significantly depending on these factors, and that it can be quite high in some cases.We also compare the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm with that of other algorithms for computing the primary decomposition of monomial ideals, such as the Buchberger-M\\\"olter algorithm and the Hibi-Matsumura algorithm. Our results show that while Villamayor's algorithm has a simpler theoretical complexity, its practical performance can be worse than that of the other algorithms in some cases.Our findings have important implications for the choice of algorithm for computing the primary decomposition of monomial ideals in different situations. We also discuss potential avenues for future research on improving the efficiency of Villamayor's algorithm in the non exceptional monomial case.Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm and its limitations in the non exceptional monomial case, and provide insights that can be useful for practitioners and researchers working in the field of computational commutative algebra.",

We utilized Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observations to investigate the properties of BS 90 and its surrounding environment. The ACS data provide high-resolution imaging capabilities that allow us to study the cluster's structure and color properties in detail. We found that BS 90 has a age of approximately 200 million years, which places it in the intermediate-age range between young and old clusters. The cluster's color-magnitude diagram reveals a clear red giant branch, which suggests that the cluster has undergone significant evolution since its formation. We also identified a number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which are likely to be the precursors of planetary nebulae. The spatial distribution of the stars in BS 90 shows a centrally concentrated distribution, indicative of a dynamically evolved cluster. Moreover, we found that the cluster's morphology is consistent with a mass of approximately 10^4 solar masses. The study of BS 90 provides valuable insights into the star formation history of the SMC and the evolution of intermediate-age clusters. The results of this study can be used to inform future research on the formation and evolution of star clusters in external galaxies.",

Our sample consists of 12 quasars, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and followed up with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We detected millimeter and radio emission from all 12 quasars, with luminosities ranging from 10^26 to 10^28 W Hz^(-1). The millimeter and radio spectra show a range of shapes, with some quasars exhibiting flat or even slightly inverted spectra, while others show steep spectra. We interpret these observations in the context of quasar evolution and find that the flat-spectrum sources are likely to be young, recently triggered quasars, while the steep-spectrum sources are older, more evolved quasars. Our results provide new insights into the early stages of quasar evolution and highlight the importance of multi-wavelength observations in understanding the growth and development of supermassive black holes.",

The results show that the proposed model accurately predicts the material's behavior under various loading conditions, including those that result in damage. The model's ability to capture the material's anisotropic behavior is particularly notable, as it can accurately predict the differences in mechanical properties between the principal directions. The proposed model has important implications for the design and analysis of concrete structures, as it can help engineers better understand and predict the material's behavior under various loading conditions.

Using a sample of 100 F and G dwarfs within 20 parsecs of the Sun, we measure the stellar velocity components in the Galactic Cartesian coordinates and compute the age of each star using stellar evolution models. We find that the velocity field of F and G dwarfs changes significantly with age, with younger stars exhibiting higher velocities in the direction of Galactic rotation. We also find that the velocity dispersion of F and G dwarfs decreases with age, indicating that these stars become more settled in their orbits as they age. Our results suggest that the velocity field of F and G dwarfs can be used as a clock to estimate the age of these stars, which can be useful for studying the history and evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the stellar populations in the solar neighborhood and the role of galactic dynamics in shaping the velocity field of stars.",

Our results show that third dredge-up leads to an enhancement of carbon and nitrogen at the surface, while hot-bottom burning increases the abundance of oxygen and reduces that of sodium.

The move reflects the central bank's increasing confidence in the strength of the US economy's recovery from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. With this fresh signal, investors and economists now eagerly await further details on the timeline and specifics of the Federal Reserve's tapering plan.The decision to potentially accelerate the unwinding of the stimulus program underscores the positive economic indicators witnessed in recent months, including robust job growth, rising consumer spending, and an improving labor market. While initially, discussions suggested a gradual withdrawal of the stimulus, the Federal Reserve's latest move indicates a possible pivot towards a more expedited approach.Market analysts suggest that an accelerated unwinding of the stimulus could have both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, it may help curb inflationary pressures and provide a boost to the US dollar. However, concerns over a potential tightening of credit conditions and its impact on already high levels of national debt remain.As the Federal Reserve continues to monitor economic progress and gauge the appropriate timing for scaling back its stimulus measures, market dynamics will undoubtedly experience fluctuations. Therefore, investors and economists will remain vigilant, analyzing the central bank's next steps for potential implications on various sectors of the economy, including equities, housing, and interest rates.",

Lisa Jones, 35, of Aberystwyth was driving home from work on June 3rd when another vehicle crossed into her lane. Police said the other driver, Thomas Evans, had a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit at the time of the crash. Lisa sadly passed away at the scene from her injuries as a result of the high-speed head-on collision. Thomas Evans pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 5 years in prison. However, Lisa's family believes the current guidelines are too lenient and do not properly punish those who make the reckless decision to drink and drive. \"She had her whole life ahead of her and it was taken away in an instant by someone's selfish actions,\" said Lisa's mother Margaret Thompson. The family is now campaigning to double the maximum sentence to 10 years for cases involving death by dangerous driving due to alcohol intoxication. They started an online petition which has already received over 5,000 signatures in support. Members of Parliament in the area have also backed the call for sentencing reform. A decision on whether guidelines will be reviewed is expected later this year. Lisa's family hopes their efforts will help deter drink driving and seek justice for victims of such irresponsible crimes.",

Steinbrueck, who serves as the former finance minister, was attending a campaign event in Hannover when he made the offensive sign to photographers. Video footage quickly emerged on social media showing the SPD leader extending his middle finger below the podium. The gesture prompted swift backlash from his political rivals. Members of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party condemned Steinbrueck's behavior as \"crass and inappropriate\" for a man hoping to become Germany's next leader. Steinbrueck later issued a statement apologizing for the incident, admitting the hand signal was \"a stupid mistake.\" Polls show the race between Merkel and Steinbrueck tightening ahead of September's federal election. However, political analysts believe Steinbrueck's gaffe has damaged his image and could sway undecided voters toward Merkel.

Several clubs are expected to be active in the market which could drive up prices.Villa's budget will have taken a significant hit following relegation with TV and other revenue streams reduced. But Wyness feels they have room to conduct business within their means. The board and manager Steve Bruce will also weigh up options via loans and free transfers if needed. Time is of the essence as pre-season training is just around the corner. Wyness said signings were possible \"in the coming weeks\" if negotiations go smoothly. Success in the transfer market could go a long way in determining if Villa challenge for automatic promotion or better next season.",

This decision comes after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Japan's whaling practices were not scientifically justified and must cease. The Japanese government has said that it will abide by the ICJ's ruling, but will continue to hunt whales in other parts of the world. This move has been met with criticism from conservation groups, who argue that Japan's whaling practices are still harmful to the species and must be stopped entirely. Despite this, Japan has maintained that its whaling practices are necessary for scientific research and cultural traditions. The resumption of whaling in the Pacific Ocean is expected to spark further international controversy and debate.",

The study found that approximately 10 million people in the UK have stayed up late or skipped sleep altogether in order to finish a series or watch multiple episodes in a row. This behavior has led to a phenomenon known as \"sleep-bingeing,\" where individuals prioritize their entertainment over their rest and relaxation. The study suggests that this trend may be detrimental to both physical and mental health, as sleep deprivation can lead to a host of negative consequences, including fatigue, irritability, and decreased productivity. Despite these potential risks, many Britons continue to indulge in binge-watching, highlighting the enduring popularity of streaming services and the desire for escapist entertainment.",
