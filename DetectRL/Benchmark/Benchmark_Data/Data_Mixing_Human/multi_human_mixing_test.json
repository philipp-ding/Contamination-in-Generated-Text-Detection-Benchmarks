We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at highGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-likebehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.",

HS0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbitalperiod of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observedphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopicbehaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These newadditions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per centof the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating therequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and themodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becomingmore pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h periodinterval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed byour results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of theHamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbitalperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems closeto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with thestandard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have thehighest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range ofcommon properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.",

Inthis paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fieldsthrough comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). Wefind that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed ofboth intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not showstrong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, inthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in theeastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent starformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to thewestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CFanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in theseparts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located inthe southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southernfields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all theCMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferredfrom the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here aredominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lackof a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicatethat a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observedfields.",

These morphological classifications are compared tolocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surfacemass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification.

A correlation is also found between morphology and localprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to thenearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is moreimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown ofthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in thegalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of redgalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry fromCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passivegalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescriptionof Wolf et al.

Previous models ofSolar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapseof the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a veryclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questionsrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a closesupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulationsdemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock toescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass lossoccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of thedisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. Theselow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that thehigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the diskbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to beconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. Onthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed intodust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will beinjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoriticabundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore areconsistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.",

Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, andSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end uplocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, theresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets inthe disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance forthe two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped orreversed.

For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins ortranscription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levelsof downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework toinvestigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by theanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of theexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfersystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in theabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolicnetwork. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation indifferent nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagateelsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freelyshared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to studymetabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networkswhich are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications forbioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.",

The method makes use of the probability generating function(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random networkand makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in awell-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number ofinfecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translatingbetween network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemicincidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking theevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds.

We examine the spectra of 137quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find noclear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comovingMpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest withoutadditional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth duringcosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), todescribe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift aroundz = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individualneighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models inwhich the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percentat z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large(40-50 Angstrom) voids.

Therefore, it is important to study numericallythe collisional outcome from low velocity impacts of equal sized porousagglomerates which are too large to be examined in a laboratory experiment. Weuse the Lagrangian particle method Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics to solve theequations that describe the dynamics of elastic and plastic bodies.Additionally, to account for the influence of porosity, we follow a previousdeveloped equation of state and certain relations between the material strengthand the relative density. Collisional growth seems possible for rather lowcollision velocities and particular material strengths. The remnants ofcollisions with impact parameters that are larger than 50% of the radius of thecolliding objects tend to rotate. For small impact parameters, the collidingobjects are effectively slowed down without a prominent compaction of theporous structure, which probably increases the possibility for growth. Theprotoplanetesimals, however, do not stick together for the most part of theemployed material strengths. An important issue in subsequent studies has to bethe influence of rotation to collisional growth. Moreover, for realisticsimulations of protoplanetesimals it is crucial to know the correct materialparameters in more detail.",

Radiative recombination continua(RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that theemission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDYphotoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column densitymodel (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing alldetected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-liketriplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data wereignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux fromintercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonanceline data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only twocomponents.

We findthat the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and systemsize, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite systemsize do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topologicalentropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for anyinfinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant asthe temperature is further increased.

Furthermore, it has beenrecently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have aresolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find highermodularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms.

The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed andasymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observedasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in theouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic andsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of ourobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule isgravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggestthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of theouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state nearhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internalsupport. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsationwould be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule dueto the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for thedouble-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinctionmaps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinctiondata provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ whileN2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visualextinction.",

The lack of any bright SN down tovery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,strikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we presentspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that theburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic breakis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with thebreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviourand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the bestexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglowlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there isstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a breakfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early timesand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying athigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-raylight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extendedemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show thatthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRTobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exitsit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24keV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is howeverdistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.Considering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistentwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.",

Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity ofstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are opticallythin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empiricalmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can beoptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account forclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumpsreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergentspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that theoptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PVresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken intoaccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line andrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumpingmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha linein O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of opticallythick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimatingempirical mass-loss rates.",

The study of diffusion on such networks ismotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronizationproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport onnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a richphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context ofrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, andin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to themotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established thatin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small densityof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interactiontopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In somecases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in theEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. Thisbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, wherethe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of anaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are alsoconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of thenetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework forthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finitenetworks.

Inthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in thepropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactorexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes ofdecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, bymeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. Byassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrinomixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar norKamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whosecharacteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained.

The main results are the following. 1) Thecirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previouslyoverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is inaccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at agiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasingamplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dustemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on averagebut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions havesystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness andkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strongnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron powerspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a functionof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modificationof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproducethe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.",

Inp-wave systems involving the mixture of two-hyperfine states, we show that theinterference pattern exhibits a polarization effect depending on the relativeorientation of the two vector order parameters. Lastly, we also point out thatp-wave Fermi condensates exhibit an anisotropic expansion, reflecting thespatial anisotropy of the underlying interaction between fermions and theorbital nature of the vector order parameter.

Accurate photometry(especially for faint sources) requires two simple processing steps beyond thestandard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients. Point spreadfunction (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densitiesthan aperture photometry. Based on the PSF fitting photometry, the calibrationfactor shows no strong trend with flux density, background, spectral type,exposure time, or time since anneals. The coarse-scale calibration sampleincludes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, onbackgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. Thecoarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) andis based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,respectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from twostars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all timescales probed. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +/- 294MJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) based on 10 stars. The uncertainty inthe coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5%photometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma,500 s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy. This work showsthat the MIPS 70 micron array produces accurate, well calibrated photometry andvalidates the MIPS 70 micron operating strategy, especially the use of frequentstimulator flashes to track the changing responsivities of the Ge:Ga detectors.",

For example, the quantumenergy levels of dopants will be affected by the proximity of nanometer-scaleelectrodes. Moreover, because shallow donors and acceptors are analogous tohydrogen atoms, experiments on small numbers of dopants have the potential tobe a testing ground for fundamental questions of atomic and molecular physics,such as the maximum negative ionization of a molecule with a given number ofpositive ions[4,5]. Electron tunneling spectroscopy through isolated dopantshas been observed in transport studies[6,7]. In addition, Geim and coworkersidentified resonances due to two closely spaced donors, effectively formingdonor molecules[8]. Here we present capacitance spectroscopy measurements ofsilicon donors in a gallium-arsenide heterostructure using a scanning probetechnique[9,10]. In contrast to the work of Geim et al., our data showdiscernible peaks attributed to successive electrons entering the molecules.Hence this work represents the first addition spectrum measurement of dopantmolecules.

However, the process of collaboration introducessignificant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the sameinformation. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces thecollaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the firstphase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when theyoccur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the secondphase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system andbeamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. Thisstep requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complexnumber, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and whichenables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the networkcoordinates.

The cost of games - especially computer games - toys and hobbies shot up by 2.7%.Prices are also on the rise for clothing, up 0.6% compared with a fall of 0.3% a year ago, with children's clothing seeing the biggest increase.The ONS also reported higher prices for furniture and household goods.Shoppers have been used to falling prices in the supermarket aisles in recent years but this trend is now at an end.Sugar, jams, chocolate, syrups and confectionary all contributed to the latest rise in this category.With inflation now at its highest rate in nearly four years, the impact of past falls in sterling continue to feed through to households, according to Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics: \"Food inflation rose by 2.5% according to the latest data, the fastest since 2013. Given the least affluent households spend around 17% of their expenditure on food and drink, rising prices will have a significant impact on their discretionary spending power going forward.\"What's more, real earnings are already shrinking. With inflation expected to accelerate further in the coming months, the backdrop for retailers looks set to become even more challenging.\"Electricity bills jumped by 4% and gas bills were also slightly up, reflecting price hikes from some of the big six energy suppliers.But travel costs were down. Air fares usually go down after Easter, one of the peak holiday periods. Because Easter came later this year, air fares fell back in May, which was a big contributor to the downward effect.And the prices at the pump also dropped between April and May this year, bringing some relief, at least, to consumers.",

It will be easier for us to manage.\"The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would \"dramatically improve the design\" of the station.Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: \"HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.\"She said the council is \"ardently opposed to the scheme\", adding it could only be a success with \"close collaboration\" between the local authority, residents and businesses.HS2 Ltd's new plan will be submitted to Parliament next week in order to form part of the legislation which will allow phase one of High Speed 2 to go ahead.The firm also announced that the budget of the Euston project has risen from Â£2 billion to Â£2.25 billion, but said this would not affect HS2's overall budget of Â£42 billion.",

Britain is becoming a nation of value shoppers.\"He added Travelodge's current owners were \"not natural long-term holders of the business\".\"I think you'd expect them always to be thinking about ways to realise value from their shareholdings, but for now we stay focused on running the business we have got,\" he said.Travelodge said a £100m modernisation programme was now nearing completion, while five of 15 hotels new properties expected for 2015 were already open.The chain has opened more than 500 hotels since launching in 1985 and has identified 250 more sites across the UK.Mr Gowers said the first 150 were expected to be ready over the next eight years.",

Henrietta Rushwaya, once the federation chief executive, received a life ban for the second time for involvement in the attempted fixing.Rushwaya was banned for life after a previous match-fixing scandal, but that sanction was overturned.

His tweet of apology was met with comments below it, calling him \"utterly disgraceful\" and \"appalling\".The Daily Mail article appeared in both the print copy of the newspaper and its online version.Marr's wife, journalist Jackie Ashley, tweeted about Letts' article, criticising the message it sent out to disabled people.The Stroke Association said: \"A stroke is not a joke. Stroke survivors deserve our respect and support, and Andrew Marr deserves an apology\", before encouraging people make complaints to the Independent Press Standards Organisation.In a statement to the BBC, the Independent Press Standards Organisation said: \"we have received a total of 11 complaints about the article.\"All of the complaints are under Clause 12 (Discrimination), with one or two also citing Clause 1 (Accuracy) or Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock).\"It is IPSO policy not to comment on the identity of individual complainants, so I am unable to confirm the names of anyone who has contacted us on this article.\"Robert Peston's new ITV Sunday politics talk show had received lukewarm reviews following its debut this weekend.Letts reviewed Peston's programme as \"breathless and batty - and bound to be a hit\".",

Documents were seized both from there and from the bank he heads in Sao Paulo.At the same time, the leader of the governing Workers Party in the Senate, Delcidio Amaral, was also arrested.Both men are accused of obstructing the course of the investigation.Mr Esteves is Brazil's 13th richest man, worth an estimated $2.5bn (Â£1.7bn), while Mr Amaral is the first sitting legislator to be detained in the scandal.After his arrest early on Wednesday, police released a recording in which Mr Amaral appears to suggest that the imprisoned former head of Petrobras' international division should refrain from disclosing any evidence about Mr Amaral and Mr Esteves.In exchange, the Petrobras executive, Nestor Cervero, would be helped to escape from Brazil to Europe, reports said.The tape was secretly recorded by Cervero's son. He told Brazilian media that his father and he had disagreed with the escape plan.Later on Wednesday, the Senate held an emergency session and backed up the Supreme Court's decision to arrest Mr Amaral.More than 100 people have now been arrested in the two-year investigation, including politicians and former top executives at Petrobras, and some of the country's biggest construction firms.Although Brazil's President and former Petrobras Chair Dilma Rousseff has not been directly implicated in the scandal she is under severe political pressure over its implications, says the BBC's Wyre Davis in Rio de Janeiro.The president of the Workers Party, Rui Falcao, has published a statement distancing himself from the disgraced senator.He said was \"perplexed by the facts\" that led to the arrest.\"None of the acts attributed to the senator is connected to his activities for the party.\"For that reason, the Workers Party does not feel obliged to lend him any solidarity,\" added Mr Falcao.",

His barrister told the judge:  \"He suffers from dementia which has a cardiovascular cause and he wouldn't be able to properly follow the course of proceedings.\"A prosecution lawyer suggested that he would commission a psychiatrist to examine the defendant. He also requested full access to Mr Bell's medical files.The case was adjourned until 16 December.Mr Bell faces two counts of soliciting Mrs McConville's murder, both of which he denies.Mrs McConville's remains were found on Shelling Hill beach in County Louth by a member of the public in August 2003. Nobody has been convicted of her murder.The case against Mr Bell is based on the content of tapes police secured from an oral history archive collated by Boston College in the United States.",

We moved for a while, kissing and generally enjoying ourselves. Eventually she sat up. She was beautiful like this. Hair wild, eyes bright. Naked in bed. I scanned her form slowly, enjoying her curves and the look on her face as she watched me. Her slender neck, sloping shoulders, perfect breasts, glowing stomach.... Wait what? My heart sank. I strained my eyes, trying to convince myself that what I saw was just a trick of the light. There was no mistake. My wife was pregnant, and the child inside her would one day be my undoing. My family gift, knowing what person or thing would kill us, has never been more of a curse. \" Honey? \" My wife' s concerned voice breaks through my thoughts.

It was the true Joy of Painting, to shed your worries and focus on the canvas, pouring yourself out for all of your world to see, whether it was millions on national television or simply your loved ones. There was such beauty in it, such beauty. Could he truly say he was better than this man? Bob still remembered the hateful and angry person he had once been. The Air Force had brought out the worst in him. He did n' t deserve to be saved, yet he had found salvation in painting anyway. Who was he to deny another person this? Another living, breathing human being. And yet the stakes were too high. In the end, that warrior Bob had once been had never truly died. He had simply stepped aside to let the painter flourish. Now that same warrior stepped forward, the paint knife steady in his hand, its surface glimmering titanium white. Adolf Hitler never saw it coming. A river of red danced down the landscape. It blinded Bob with tears. Even at a moment like this, there was beauty to be found on the canvas.",

Usually, when someone went missing, we would wait a day or two to see if they showed up. This time, the Guard was called immediately and a search was started. Someone had taken the princess, and that wasn' t a petty, forgettable crime. Ranging up and down the foothills, I could find no tracks of any kind. Quite literally, the kidnappers had left no trail. Possibly, they' d run off through the trees, but it seemed unlikely that they could do that carrying the 100 pound princess. Over every hill, there was nothing but the empty forest to greet me and taunt me. No signs of any disturbance. Moreover, the sky was beginning to darken, and the trail would go cold, soon. Lazily drifting, I plodded along the path until I found a tree that looked capable of supporting my weight and providing a comfortable night' s rest. Kicking off my shoes, I prepared to climb. Just as I placed my hands on the trunk, I noticed a shining piece of fabric caught in a branch, higher up. Impossible. Half excited, half scared, I climbed the tree. I observed the fabric closely. Gold griffins looked up at me, sewn into the fabric with an expert' s hand. Feeling it confirmed that it was silk, and upon a moment' s thought I remembered the design on the princess' s dress. Excited for the thrill of the chase, I took off to tell the King I' d found a clue. During my reckless flight, though, I tripped and crashed into the ground. Catching my breath slowly, I stood up.

John was just finishing up his first year of highschool and had already been elected class president as well as created a position of student representative for school-board meetings which he of course filled himself. The school seemed to twist itself around his finger all of its own accord. He had a natural charisma and grace which people could n' t help but succumb to. He' d realized this ability early in the school year and decided to develop it fully, researching sociology, interrogation, deprogramming, and psychology. The natural aptitude he had for these subjects was put into practice as he laid the foundation for his little empire. Hours of meeting with teachers and parents outside of classes, attending parties and hanging out with friends so as not to loose the student' s support as he gained the adults. Eventually he had gained respect and recognition from both parties, and had a base of power from which to apply leverage. Now he could plant ideas in the student body, a conversation here, a rumor there. The same techniques could be applied to the adults though with more subtlety. Slowly they would come to fruition and it would be suggested that it would of course be proper to arrange a meeting between their best and brightest students and the state senators, America' s future leaders and all that.

I do have flaws, but my good points are so great that no one should really care about any imperfections. Whatever they are. Wait, I just found one, I' m too damn humble. Just kidding. I' m way too conceited sometimes. Jesus christ, this teacher just keeps talking. Holy shit, Lisa has a nice ass too. Never had that grand against me, though. Hahaha, the teacher just said \" some thing' s likely to pop up \" while I was thinking of Lisa' s ass in those yoga pants. Oh, thank god class is final over. Time sure went by quick.",

The fabric of reality pressed in around him and the world stood frozen in an unnatural silence as if holding its breath.

None of the scientists observing it knew how this was possible. It was n' t a big machine, no larger than a modern refrigerator. But the clockwork of it was exquisite, the cogs and gears machined to perfection. Every piece of the machine was etched with runes. Strangely, the runes seemed to spin and twist as the eye passed over them. If the eye stopped on a still gear, the runes would lazily spin as one looked upon them. No one could look at the machine for long before having headaches. One researcher had to be flown to Rio de Janeiro for a migraine that blinded the poor woman. Many thought we should move it, take it to a lab to be studied. Many more thought we should destroy it. Still more wanted it to be left alone, reburied and forgotten again. The researchers came to the conclusion that it was counting down, but no one knew how they knew. \" It just came to me. I was asleep then sat bolt upright and screamed' it' s counting down!' I scared my roommate out of his skin with that one haha \" The runes adapted to us. As they watched it, all the researchers saw the change, it was so quick a few missed it because they were blinking at the time. The entire machine stopped for less than a heartbeat, then continued with one minor difference. The runes could be read. It adapted itself to your dominate language. The alphabet appeared as the runes. They still moved and danced under your vision, but it was letters and numbers you could understand. When this news broke the world gasped and every country, those who did n' t already have a scientist there, sent their best in hopes of breaking the code first. They were frantic in their translations, most of them meaning nothing, just garbled letters and numbers. Then, in the early morning light one researcher falling asleep at the desk broke the code.'

I thought back to the Cosmodrome from which millions of explorers such as myself had been sent into the deepest reaches of space, most of whom would never return. I remembered what the Great Researchers had told us *Forward, brothers, the sky is red* they had shouted into the legions of men with great thunderous voices. This was the threshold of something *more*, something *greater* than everything we could have imagined. The Eye of God lay before me, despite being nothing but a nebula one could almost *feel* it piercing the depths of their soul. But something seemed off, something I had not noticed in my hours staring into its depths from my craft. A black, all encompassing shadow was swallowing the nebula from the top and bottom. Had I just witnessed the death of a nebula? No. It was something far greater than I could have ever imagined. The nebula *opened* again, it had *blinked*. Was this some sort of anomaly? Or had I just witnessed something from a separate plane of existence? I do n' t know. But the nebula *blinked*, I saw it with my own eyes. And I would likely be the only person to behold such a sight for the rest of time. I was at the center of the Bootes Void and would likely never see another human for the rest of my life, my craft would drift throughout the void for all of time. I would never be able to inform the Great Researchers of my discovery, I would die alone in the Void with no accomplishments except this. I had seen a nebula blink, now that I think about it... Was the Helix Nebula even a nebula to begin with, or was it part of some great interstellar being? I will never know.",

Its contents were handwritten. Its stamp was applied with human hands. Craig kissed it. He knew what it contained. \" Dear Daddy, We are having a great time here in Paris. We just went up the Eiffel Tower and tomorrow we are going to see the Mona Lisa. Wish you were with us! Love, Katy XOX \" Craig set the postcard aside, but in a different stack. His eyes shifted to the final letter. With a quick glimpse of the return address, his eyes dropped. His fingers slowly tore open the envelope from Monroe County Circuit Court and unfolded the letter. Craig' s eyes fell again. A divorce summons. Also overdue. Our hero took all four letters and consolidated them into a single stack, which he chucked into a wastebin. He had a letter of his own to write. \" Dear anyone, I' m sorry. It could have gone a lot better. But it did n' t. Tell Katy I' m sorry, please. Tell her I' m really stupid.

The stench of rot and death fills the air. I ca n' t see. It' s so dark. I sit and cry. Just let me die. Wait! Did you hear that? A voice. Not one of pain and suffering. One of beauty. A small flame flickers in my heart. I stand up. I begin to walk, to follow the melodious voice. Sinister whispers begin to assault me. \" It would be easier to lay back down. What' s the point of fighting this. I deserve this. \" Part of me wants to give in. No! I grasp onto that angelic voice. I use it as a lifeline. Light pierces the gloom. It becomes a thread to follow. I begin to run. Hands grasp at me, shadows move in and out. They try to pull me back down. I slip and fall. This is it. The edge of the knife. How easy it would be to just close my eyes. but the voice, it calls me. I fight back, and drag myself to my feet. I do n' t want to give up! I need help! Help me! Light blazes across the made of despair. From that light, a hand reaches out to me. I reach out, and out fingers meet............... and my wife helps me out of the car. She looks me in the eye. She is so proud of me. She will be with me every step of the way. It will be a long road, but she knows I will make it. She really has no idea how she has saved me.

The African Union has been threatening the Strait since Spain captured Isla de Alborán as a naval base with the backing of NATO in direct violation of the Treaty Of Tangier. The Soviet Union has been working with the U. N. as an arbitrator between the European Powers and the A. U. but the United States has accused the Soviet Union of having ulterior motives since a conference in Tokyo where Soviet Academics talked about worsening relationships between Africa and Europe making fertile ground for a socialist revolution, First Secretary Khrushchev dismissed the comments as being \"... just hypothetical musings of scholars, something the Soviet Union encourages... \". The U. N. also hopes to resolve the fate of the stateless Boer people who were expelled out of Africa along with other European peoples from Zimbabwe and Algeria after the introduction of Cairo Accord which stripped citizenship and expelled ancestors of European colonists still living on the Continent. Currently no nation has agreed to take in ten thousand displaced people who currently reside in displaced persons camps in Brazil who have made moves to close the camps and move the people on stating \" we believe we have no responsibility to these people and that the nations that placed their ancestors in Africa should repatriate them \". The meetings will start Monday despite expert predictions that negotiations will stall due to U.S. vetoes.",

These were n' t the eyes of a killer but of a beast with an undying rage. This was a beast who' s master had been slaughtered. There were four us who dared to stop the beast. Koren went in to the den first. A man too proud to ever accept help or assistance. A battle cry and a loud, bone shattering crunch were the only sounds heard. His limp body was thrown from the den. We constructed a grave for him. We placed his sword in his grave with him. If there is an afterlife, he will need it. The twins Ryker and Rayk now entered the den. I heard the sound of projectiles flying through the air, accompanied with the sound of them hitting their mark. A roar emerged from the den with enough force to shoot Ryker out of the den like a bat out of hell. He hit tree, his back was broken when I reached him. \" Help. \" Was all he could get out. I nodded my head as I thrust my dagger into his chest. The cave had grown silent. I approached to Rayk lying face down in a pool of blood. On his arm was a message. For the Village was all it said. I now turned to face the dragon with my dagger still unsheathed. In the ancient tongue I yelled, \" I am Yagua. Fear me and all that I am and will become. \" The dragon breathed a fire as if he were a volcano. We fought not for our own sake, but for our races. We fought tooth for tooth, and nail for claw. After what seemed like an hour of fighting, the dragon stumbled. I pierced his heart with my dagger. I am the victor. I dug graves for Ryker and Rayk next to Koren. I walked back to town to hear the cries of joy, the applause, and the singing. I was not a hero, but a savior. Day by day, more dragons perish by our hands. We have taken back half of our land. One day I dream of returning to the home my wife and I once shared by the river. I am Yagua, and this is my tale.",

As I was saying, how many times have we been like this, only for you to be saved by the boy blunder or by some new gadget you have on your belt. But, not *this* time Bats my boy, not this time. The boy blunder is thankfully dead, Harley saw to that! And between you and me, it got her out of my hair for several hours, and anything that can do that is fine by me! And now here you are, your Gadgets of one, your side kick dead, and I have you all to myself. But I wonder Bats, what' s to become of you? If you' re dead, who will I play with? Who will be the yin to my yang, the spade to my club, the.... well damn I ca n' t think of another one, but you get the picture old boy. You see, how can I kill you? What fun is there in your death! I would have no one to equal me. Cobblepot is fat and has a bad eye, hardly worthy of fighting Bat girl, let alone me. Bane? One tug on his juice and he' s a hollow shell of a man. No bats, no, you... you complete me! Without you, what is to become of me? I' d go mad! Well... mad-er. But then here we are, locked in conundrum. You wo n' t kill me, you' ll simply throw me in Arkham, but I' ll escape as always, just like Every. Single. Other. Time. And if I kill you, I might as well die. So we are at an impass bats. So, I propose we sit here, as my henchmen tear down this town! Gum? No? You sure? Alright, suit yourself, and do n' t say I never did anything nice for you So we will sit here until this lovely city is reduced to ash! Then you' ll have no shadows to hide in, no secret lair to prowl from. What then Bats? What then? Hahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahah",

He thought they were all fairly cliche, and more than played out. Tobias approached the stage in the dim lit arena. The silence was deafening. This was strange to him because he knew the seats were filled with spectators. Suddenly a giant hologram of a floating head appeared and it' s eyes shone a bright spot light on Tobias. \" Show me what you got \" proclaimed the head. Tobias sat in the floor with his legs crossed and began rocking side to side. The crowd began to get aggitated as nothing seemed to be happening. They did n' t seem to notice that a black cloud had begun to form above the arena. Red hot lightning shattered the sky lights and began striking Tobias. The only way to explain what happened next is to say he began \" shifting \". He began to bleed through the fabric of the universe. And like that he was gone. A few moments later he returned with a rather homely looking woman. In a big booming voice he announced, \" This is the ugliest woman in all the multiverse. She is known as u/ImTroll' s mother. I will prove to you that I am the most powerful being, worthy of at least a power rating of 10. I will do this by having sex with her and not vomitting everywhere. Tobias began. He was going strong. Spectators began to walk out, unable to watch the horrifying display. The level indicator began ticking from 1 to 7, very rapidly. And slowly it turned over to an 8. But then something happened he did n' t expect. He began to feel weak. And his pace slowed along with the rising level indicator. Tobias yelled, \" I' m like a flashbang going off in a small room! \" Tobias felt a cold hand grab him by the scruff of his neck. Then, he felt himself being pulled in close to his partner. And in his ear she whispered, \" your purpose is limited and your novelty account is gay. \"",

That gray can swallow your soul and chew it until there' s nothing left but despair. It steals the light from the sky and makes you believe the sun will never shine again. As I walk, I feel glad I am gone from that place. The gray here lends itself to mystery. I pass by an old man shouting into the sky. I imagine he' s lost his mind in the fog and is calling out to find his wits. I imagine he' s been searching for millennia and he will continue to search until the end of time, even though he' s really just nuts. But this mist has a way of making this believable. Magic lives here. Much of it is overridden by the sounds and pulse of this city, but there are places where it still beats with solemn notes. The fog soon burns off from the heat of the sun. The mystery is still there, but in the light of day its harder to feel. The brightness of it has a way of filling the dark corners of the world and revealing their secrets, pushing away the mystery. The feeling begins to fade from me as if the magic itself is burning off with the gray fog above. The old man continues to scream at the sky.",

We can circulate the world in less than a day. Our lifespans have doubled over the last century thanks to medical research. This increase would be greater, if it were n' t for the one thing we value more than a human life: Money. Money is what holds us back as a species. We are willing to do pathetic, senseless and degrading acts against humanity in pursuit of such wealth. We murder other human beings for money. Money governs society. In turn, society develops around economy, and some nations have become run by the corporations that earn for it. Powerful countries exploit weaker ones for their resources, preventing their advancement. We have the capacity to develop so much faster, yet we are held back by those in pursuit of materialistic gains.

A glance told him that he was n' t going to be able to shut it down quickly, if at all. He agreed with the Captain, in principle; the message was undoubtedly from deep space, from a star Humans had never visited, and it had undoubtedly done something to the communications system. And it had, now without a doubt, spread to the Engineering systems. So the question was, how did they call for help -- or even pass on a warning -- without spreading the infection? Also, where were they going? Chuck' s jaw was clenched again. He reached up and massaged it until it loosened. Red lights played across the board.",

Last time he was gone, he left for ten days. He went over to Siam Reap. We live in Phnom Penh, so that is a long way. It is almost eight hours! But when Dad came home, he brought me lots of new clothes. I know my dad is important to the Rouge. My dad is important because we get a lot of food, and my mom is allowed to teach me. My friend' s daddy is important too, because she met Him too. He seems very nice. He brought me sweets, and a doll. My mommy told me before he came that I must be very polite. But I know why. I know the rules: do n' t question, do as you are told, and above all, what Pol Pot says, that is law. He said that I was a nice girl, and that I have a future in his regime! I said, \" How silly, because I am only 7! I ca n' t work yet! \" And he laughed at me. I think he is a nice man. He gives me sweets, and my daddy a job. I wonder if he knows of SretMeng, my friend. I saw her on my way home yesterday. She was standing very close to a gate. She looked very hungry and we talked. She said she was camping, but does n' t know where her mommy is. SretMeng told me that she lives in Bati. That is very far from here, too. I wonder why she is camping at an old factory in Phnom Penh? I wish I could camp alone. Maybe Pol Pot will go visit her next. I hope he gives her sweets, because she was very nice.",

This letter should be delivered to you by Grant Tash, that same Grant Tash that went camping with us into the nature reserve to pick wild strawberries. He will take you out of the Greater Sherando Area. You' ll be able to meet up with some of your cousins. Play nice with them, as your shared experiences and heritage are all that you have with each other. In an ever-changing world, you will only have each other to anchor you down. Bad men and women have taken over this country, and they hate people like us. They have convinced many of our friends to turn on us for who we are. Our sole crime: being Calabrese. In Rodenas Square, innocent Calebreseians are being cruelly hurt by a group of Lapumas. This country is not the country that you know. This is not the country that I knew when I was young. It has changed for the worse, and our welcome has been determined to be overstayed. Maybe one day, when all of this is over, things can return back to normal. Lapumas and Calebresians can one day live together in peace again and you will be able to play with little Sammy again. But until that day comes, you must stay strong. You must look out for yourself, and your cousins, and other Calebresians. I do n' t expect you to understand any of this. This world is very harsh and unforgiving. But remember that I will always love you and I am proud of how tough you are. Your father, your mother, and I will always be watching over you. You are our sweet sunshine and no one can take that away from you. Your loving uncle, Milan Cutro PS: If you can, avoid Campbell Hollow. It may seem like it' s a warm and inviting settlement, but no Calabresian who entered has ever gotten out.",

ZOMBIES! Come on, really? Necromancy literally derives its meaning from the Greek' nekromanteia'. Literally, divination by the dead. A tween with a tablet can look it up in mere minutes, but will we ever separate my noble profession from generations of ignorance? Unlikely. Still, people like me have found good work in the world. Necromancers never out themselves, but plenty of professions need us. Mystical mediums can allow people to talk to their beloved dead. Even some priests can use their ability to help comfort the living by representing the dead. The divination we receive through death is useful in many ways, but NOT in the ways people usually think of. I find my talents especially useful in my current profession as a diagnostician. I do n' t need a person to be dead to divine what killed them. Is your liver dying on you? Your heart, lungs, or even your brain? Allow me to run a bunch of tests, make it all look official, and allow me to touch you one time with enough sedatives in you that my arcane mutterings sound perfectly reasonable. In a minute or two I can understand everything within your living body that is dead or dying. From there, I hand my patients over to the \" real \" doctors. I will just collect my ridiculously large checks and move on to the next patient. Your dying cells communicate everything I need to make a living off of your misery. I can glean the when, the why and the how they go from individual healthy cells to dead tissue just by politely asking. Have I met any other necromancers in the ward? No. Why? No idea, its literally the easiest career you could imagine. Does it bother me? Not in the least. I love getting awarded every year as the most accurate diagnostician in the medical industry.",

Human noises have been replaced by a thick blanket of silence. This world was always wasted on anyone that was not you. You and your dastardly smile that melted my heart, mischief always in your eyes. Your eyes always were your best quality. Being with you was suffering. There was something between us, but it never blossomed in you the way it did in me. I knew that every time that I saw you, it could be the last.

The last thing I left was my watch. Perhaps you will bring it to me now. I' ve kept you safe through the war and the nuclear winter that followed. When pestilence and death crept over the land, you unnecessarily worried — you were n' t in any danger. Slowly the world ended around you, yet you endured. During the water wars, it never failed to rain on you, and when thirst turned to famine I made sure you didn' t go hungry. The starless night your family disappeared left you alone and frightened, but you soldiered on. Maybe you thought of me during that time. I' d like to think so, though I know it' s not true.

She was surprised by this and planned quering her family on the table about it. She entered the kitchen to find his brother eating his breakfast really quickly ( probably getting late to school ). When her mother saw her she looked at her puzzled and annoyed. \" What are you doing in your pajamas? Why have n' t you changed? \" She asked her. \" You are going to be late to school. And in the mean time you are going to make your brother be late. \" Rile cocked her head in confusion. \" What? \" She looked at the table. \" Mom... I do n' t go to school anymore... Remember? \" Her mother set down her plate and began shushing her back upstairs to her room. \" What are you talking about? Now go change! \" She said giving her a final push. Riley hesitantly took a step up the stairs. \" You need to take your brother too, so hurry up! \" ( What about my pills? ) Riley shook her head and thought her mother had gone mental.

It' s not even about the money. I just want to feel their blood drip down my forearm. I love that moment of fear when they know they' re about to die, but they do n' t know how. We' re making great progress here. What' s your normal spectrum of emotions during an assassination? It' ll be easier if I demonstrate. Feel free to. Ok. Well, I' m calm when I walk in.

I know it' s better to kill from afar, but once I feel the kill coming on, I ca n' t stop myself from getting up close and personal. Right now, I can feel you breathing. I love that. Better image for when I make my move. You' re doing great. Thanks. So, I take my assassination knife out of my pocket.

The bandit still had n' t noticed, and his gruff features were puzzled as he searched for his next line. I stabbed him, a quick clean cut, straight through the stomach. That was when I noticed something was wrong. Three things hit me. First, I noticed that the person who had opened the tent was not one of my friends at all. Second, the blood that now dripped onto my wrist was not typical red human blood, but the blue blood of the veilthings, the things from my world. I realized that I had not stabbed a bandit at all, but something much darker, much more powerful. He drew back, my sword sliding effortlessly back out of his body. He stood at his full height, then taller. As his transformation neared completion, he towered over me, his dark scaly body making my sword look like a pin. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that he was holding a club. That was the third thing that hit me.",

Lance wanted Samus to come; but the King demanded he had to go alone and leave Samus behind. \" It' s for the best of the kingdom \" His father said. \" It' s time you learn how to be King yourself. \" So Lance did what he was told, he wanted to please his father. He began ascending the mountain, fighting the cold winds, harsh landscapes and grueling exertion. However, Lance found himself alone, scared and unhappy. Upon further thinking he descended back down and called Samus to join him on his journey. Together they climbed the mountain and found the sword the King had requested. When they returned to the kingdom the King was most unhappy. \" Why did you bring Samus with you?

Autumn' s icy wind cut into her skin, and the cloudy days and endless nights left her alone. Just like the trees, Autumn left the her bare, cold, and naked. Just like summer, Autumn would come and change her warm days. Summer would radiate with light but no matter how wide the rays of love would stretch, summer could n' t change Autumns nature. That is why they can never belong together. The girl looked out at the few last leaves clinging to the shriveled trees. She heard her mother beckoning her. \" You fathers here. \" The girl hugs her mother tightly, basking in her warmth for as long as she could. As she descended the stairs and greets her father she could barley hold back tears. The girl looks out at her mother and to the trees, as her father begins to start the car. Summer was over. As the mother looked at the road long after the car had disappeared, a leaf fell.",

I think the most important advice I can give to you is that you will be both your best friend and your worst enemy. You alone decide your fate, whether you are happy or disappointed or angry with your life. So many people walk through their lives and do the \" right \" thing as they are told by everyone around them. Get the \" right \" job, get the \" right \" education, find the \" right \" girl. That' s bullshit. You ca n' t live your life as other people want you to, or tell you to. I did that, my entire life. Now I can leave it and try to pass on a lesson to you. After fifty years I can finally correct the mistake. I want you to read this, engross yourself in it, learn everything you can. Maybe you can correct your life now. Before you end up here, leaving a journal behind for yourself. You can fix this. Pursue your dreams and make yourself happy like I could n' t. Be stronger than I was. Be stronger than you think you are. I know you, very well. I know you can do it if you choose to. Go out there and live. That' s my first lesson for you. A lesson from a dead man.",

Douglas was planning to expand on it at length when he got the chance, and did. In essence, it was this: No one goes the heaven when they die. The souls of the dead go nowhere, remaining with the bodies they inhabited in life until the day of Judgement when the world gives up its dead and everyone goes before God for judgement. No one is clear what happens if you do n' t have a body to resurrect in, because the Bible promises bodily resurrection but there are certain types of soil that eat even bones and leave nothing but marks to indicate where a body might have been. And no one is clear whether the souls sleep until that final day, or whether they experience anything at all between their last breath and their new life. One hopes they do n' t, but if they do n' t why are graveyards as feared as they are? And why do we wall them away?

They could succumb to U.S. influence and have little to no say in global affairs, or they could fight back now before it was too late. They chose the latter. And so World War III began. The army of couch surfers assembled in their chosen caves and logged onto the secure U.S. nano-soldier server ( USNSS ). But almost immediately, there were problems. The suits were dropped into various strategic areas, and almost instantly the Battle Communication Net was awash with various shouts and cries about \" bad spawns \" and spam about how bad the current map was. Many soldiers remained inactive after landing, as they had gone to the bathroom or left to \" get a snack \". The defense of strategic targets, however, was flawless. The Army had specifically scouted \" campers \" to guard strategic U.S. emplacements and facilities. These young men and women had an almost unlimited ability to guard a specific spot and never waver in their dedication. After nearly a week, no significant progress had been made on either front. The nations of the world signed a peace treaty with the U.S., no longer seeing the new suits as a threat to their livelihoods. And life went on, same as it always was. Well, except for the numerous youth of America going on and on about how they were \" war heroes \" and how they deserved veterans benefits for the rest of their lives. And so, it seemed that the suits that were destined to lead the Americans into a position of unquestionable world leadership led to more problems than they fixed. Well, until the next year' s iteration of the suits was released. The new release would fix all the issues with the previous version. And so, the story continued...",

The world bowed in the Order that was expected, infinitely small cogs working together to move infinitely large wheels, sparking the engine that drives the Universe as it lumbers towards tomorrow. He looked upon his people, and he was satisfied. The Elders preserved their culture, assigning husbands to wives as families waltzed across generations. All was harmony. Kuang Feng looked upon a pasture, and the world itself was changed. In the fields by his people' s village, a goddess draped flowers across the crown of her flock. The instant the Great God saw this woman, all emotion filled his vision. Every aspect of life was pushed, squeezed, condensed into that one moment. He felt desire, disgust, lust and completion. He felt dizzy from the highs to which his soul has ascended, the abyss in which his mind dwelt. He felt kindness: he would hold her, delicately, as though a tuft of wind might scatter her across the Earth. He felt rage: He would obliterate any creature that would do her harm; he would tear the creature limb from limb; he would defile himself in a heartbeat to preserve her purity. It was the first time that a living being was overwhelmed by such emotion. It was so powerful that even the Great God could not contain it within himself, lest he fall into the Madness brought on by this power, this force that would leave any creature it touched with blissful insanity. And so Kuang Feng ripped the creature from his heart and scattered it amongst his people, so that all would share this joy, this burden. This is how Mankind came to know of Love, the uncontrollable beast that now lies waiting in every man' s breast. Each and every one of us carries a little bit of the Great God' s madness in our hearts.",

My other best friend was a Hinton, from a farming family down the dirt road from my house in 67. It feels like so far away now. I can see her bursting into my house, her red hair waving around as she told me about the guy she met. Some guy named Robert from town. We were all young and dumb and did n' t know any better. Of course, there was some trouble in this story. A problem about social status and stupidity. But in the end, we all got smarter and I' m glad to say she married Robert. They' re still together and have grandchildren now. Ai n' t that something? She actually wrote a book about it. Maybe you' ve heard of it. I' ve got a bit part where I saved some kids from a fire. If you got the time, I' ll be happy to tell you about that. Stay Golden, son.",

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and.... Well you see, *world cup* may mean different thing for different people. since I had no interest in football ( some guys call it saucer? ) I thought I would write on cricket World cup. P. S.: The player names are all real.",

The one with the sexy, sexy ladies with their bosoms all up in your face? Oh, *man*. But I digress. I suppose what you really want to know is what I learned, all the boring, detailed stuff. So you do n' t want to know how I learned how all the sexiest chicks were from the past. Fair enough. You felt that your education was boring and so you had to inflict your exhaustion on me. Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

They moved him to the corner of the room and turned him to face me and then left as quickly as they came. I watched them go.

This is not my story but it fits the prompt and it' s from a real research study: > The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange items into different groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities, that is the next step; otherwise, you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem important but complications can easily arise. A mistake can be expensive as well. At first, the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then, one never can tell. After the procedure is completed one arranges the materials into different groups again. Then they can be put into their appropriate places. Eventually they will be used once more and the whole cycle will then have to be repeated. However, this is part of life.

They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places. I ordered the lobster roll. It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold. I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it. I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor. The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips. A minor oversight I imagine. Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends. I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section. The bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches. The happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.

It is most popular during the workday lunch rush. I would say that they are most famous for their salads and sandwiches. They are unique Italian/Greek creations with either feta or or red peppers on everything. I particularly love their pasta de la Sandra, which is a penne pasta with mushrooms, sausage & peppers in a balsamic blend. Yumm! The Italian soup and the turkey feta, hummus, pepper sandwich with risotto, are also among my favorites! nnSo go to Buon Giorno Cafe on your next lunch break to enjoy great service, a fresh meal, and at a very good price!",

Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up. nnOK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: nthis is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee. nnNow, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good! nnTo sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff!",

I ordered off the special menu and had the corn chowder, a filet and lobster tail, a side of creamed spinach and dessert for about $55. My husband had the cowboy ribeye for $65, the scallops to start and a side of brussel sprouts. nnThe corn chowder was ok but not very hot. The scallops which came recommended were ok but they were on a pesto sauce which was simply too overpowering for the delicate scallop. We used the pesto to dip the bread in. The steaks came and were both overcooked. They were supposed to be medium rare but my filet was well done and his was more like medium. We should have complained but we decided to just eat bc we didn't want to wait and didn't think that they would be less well done since they come on a scorching hot plate. My husband liked the brussel sprouts but my creamed spinach was not hot and was stringy. nnAgain, the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly.

A round of Patron Margaritas were horrible. They tasted entirely like sour mix and we couldn't even take more than two sips. Of course, when we ask that they be taken away and replaced with shots of Patron, we were got the \"oh, you're that type, \" look and it took a while to convince the waiter that there was sincerely something wrong with the drinks.

Shrimp cocktail, crab bisque, and two oyster samplers. The soup was bland, shrimp were large, but had a wierd texture that didn't seem fresh or like they'd been scrubbed to hide something, and oysters were not evenly sampled on both orders. One appeared to contain mostly one type instead of the 8-9 different types.

And i listened as an old man (The founder? ) was telling me about the old days, and how many men died when coffee roasters would catch fire and explode. Not sure how true those stories were, but hey, he was an old man, and I was fresh out of college. Like most college students my common sense eventually came back, but that's another story. nnWell he took me back and showed me the raw beans, and how they roasted them. It was very interesting. Then he made me a cup of coffee with bean just out of the roaster, slightly cooled, he ground them in front of me, then put them in a french press and let it steep for 4 minutes. Damn, that was the best cup of Joe I ever had. So the very next day I bought a french press, went back to Nicholas Coffee, and bought a pound of espresso roast and I've been hooked every since. nnThere are many places to get coffee in this city, but this place is the tops on my list!",

Luckily I haven't had any speeding tickets here.. . but my warning, be aware of your speed. nnThe toll booth operators are ok, for the most part. You will get those with the evil attitudes. Like, I'm sorry I disturbed you.. . but lady you're the only one open. I'll make sure to sign up for EZ Pass so I can bypass you. nnAnd lastly.. . the price. So back when I was in college I frequented this road, from Pittsburgh to Philly and back. I believe the amount one way was between $12-15. Now.. . one way? Goodness I don't know the price.. . but let's put this in perspective. I now only drive the Pittsburgh/Breezewood route.. . and it's  $12. 60 one way. And this isn't even the halfway point to Philly. nnIn theory you can bypass the turnpike by driving I-80 but this road is impassable if it's snowing. And there aren't as many rest stops. So PA knows you have no choice.. . and will charge you whatever on the turnpike. nnFYI - prices are scheduled to go up Jan 1 2015. The toll booth operators are clueless as to how much the increase will be. One toll booth operator was snippy with me when I asked her. Oh well.",

Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be. On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes. Plus, sandwiches! Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again. nnAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at. Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going. Get there early.",

Others did not. In a bold move, one anchor - the former JCPenney - first turned into an outlet, then split into separate stores, with a Burlington on top and several other stores on the bottom. The ice skating rink turned into an indoor soccer field. Nothing helped. nnCharlotte City Council said they were trying to help too, first by purchasing options to buy anchor stores, and later building a transit center on the mall property (which still stands). They promised to remake the mall into a community center. As things declined, this seemed like more and more of a possibility. But as the price fell, so to did the likelihood of anything ever happening. Eventually, the mall sold to an out-of-state bidder in foreclosure court for $2 million. nnThe bad news is that the anchor stores are still owned by others. Yes, someone can actually own the mall itself - those hallways between the anchor stores - while other companies own the large anchor stores (other entities actually own chunks of the parking lot and surrounding parcels). This makes rebuilding the property that much harder. nnAt least there are always those warm memories of gunshots on warm summer nights.",

If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter.

Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you.

My New England clam chowder was hot.. . it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'.. . but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates. The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together. The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous. I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football. Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder? Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater. Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd! It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella. nThe prices for all these items came up to about $25. 00.

The Outlaw Ribeye should be outlawed if they keep serving  up so much sinew. The sinew so dominated my review that the lack of marbling (flecks of fat) and abundance of large globs of fat (large gobs don't count as marbling) were secondary.

For the price they charged the following was served: fruit (nothing special- cantaloupe, strawberries and honeydew), your typical institutional scrambled eggs - rather plain, bacon, sausage links & patties, biscuits and gravy- thin gravy, short on any sausage mixed in, frenchtoast sticks - which were hard as rocks already and they had only been open 20 minutes! It took a while, and I do mean a WHILE for our server to even show up to begin with and she didn't come back to check on us very often. I had to ASK about the Bloody Mary Bar to which she replied - \"oh yeah it's in the back there\" - this server was NOT really hawking the attributes of the restaurant like one would expect - even when we mentioned it was our first time for the Breakfast buffet.

Then she looked in my account and saw that I had money in there (enough for only 2 months of rent and my bills.. . will no real income coming in) and said that there was obviously no reason I was having problems and I shouldn't have even called her.

I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good! They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked. I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich. nnWould I recommend BBQ King? It was unique enough that with full disclosure yes. Would I go back again?

It was the first time I have ever had pork belly, and I was very excited about it. It was incredible! It was fatty, rich, and delicious, just like I expected. The grits were unlike any I have ever had before. They were almost a combination of grits and risotto.. . extremely creamy and satisfying. The quail egg on top was also a nice touch. My sister had the escargot   u00e0 la Bourguignonne. I only had a bite of hers, but they were delicious, and the puff pastry was really good as well. nnFor my entree, I had the mussels. They were good, but not great. For me the sauce could have used a little more flavor, it was kind of bland. My sister had the steak and potatoes. She said the steak was the best she had ever eaten. I tried a bite, and it was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. nnDessert really stood out for us. For dessert, I had the Apple Tart Tatin, and it was spectacular. The whole thing was delicious, but the actual puff pastry tartlet was incredible. I was full even before dessert came, but I just could not stop eating it. It was delicate, buttery, and delicious. My sister had the Creme Brulee, and it was the best that either of us have ever had. The caramelized sugar on top was perfectly crunchy, and would have made a delicious dessert by itself. The custard was delicate, yet rich at the same time. It was simply delicious. nnOverall, we had a great experience. We liked the atmosphere of the restaurant itself, and thought the waitstaff was very nice and attentive. This is definitely one of the best, if not the best meal I have had in Charlotte. We will definitely be going back.",

The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. nnThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.",

The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level. There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen. I understand (and enjoy! ) the concept of \"open kitchen\" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants. The open kitchen didn't feel right for an upscale seafood restaurant that can/should be used for special occasions and dates. nnAnyway, we had fantastic service. Just be prepared to enjoy an hour and a half relaxing meal. To start, we tried the bento box appetizer, which was a combination of different things (sashimi, sushi, beef, eggroll), but I think next time I would go with just a couple of sushi rolls. We also splurged and added the flash-fried calamari as it sounded so good when our server was describing it to us. And she was right. It was very tasty and not at all chewy. It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes. The only disappointing thing was the portion size. Good thing we got the bento box, too! nnI ordered the sea scallops for my entree and chose the Japanese ponzu sauce (there are 5 choices! ) to go with it. The three tennis ball-sized scallops had a LOT of flavor to them and the fingerling potatoes on the side were tasty, too. Again, though, the portion was pretty small, but with all things added up, we were full by the end of our meal. nnAll in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, but I can't say that when thinking of places to go in the future, I'd return anytime soon.

The second time, we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there, several empty tables, and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say, the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple, it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly, not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes, watching her, not doing much of anything. That's when I took action and walked over to her to remind her that we were waiting to be seated. She unenthusiastically walked back to the hostess stand with me.

It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy. The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra. Full bodied, spicy, splashes of berry, and low in tannins. nnAs for the pizza, it is reminiscent of the famous brick oven pizzas of Da Michele found in only Napoli. The crust is extremely thin, light. and crispy. Follow that with my \"Piu00e8ce de ru00e9sistance\" mozzarella di bufala, tangy san marzano tomato sauce, and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more.

VCA Fox Chapel is a rip off and they provide a disservice to animals and pet owners. nnAfter seeing the breakdown of the bill, I could't believe how much they charged. The one rabbit is (per statement vet) not going to get better. Yet, he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs. He also drew blood from the other bunny and yelled similar codes to the back. Turns out each of these \"codes\" he yelled back was a blood test for which they charged about $60 a piece. The one bunny also got 2 injections: 0. 3 ml of PenG was $41. 72 (mind the fact that I have this bottle of PenG at home because the vet put the other bunny on this medication weeks ago, so he should/ could have remembered that and just let me give the injection at home if that's what they charge for this! And the whole 100 ml bottle was about $8 at the store) and 0. 1 ml (yes, a tiny tiny amount) of Metacam for $43. 34. The base consultation is $77 for a bunny. nnThe office manager later told me that I should have just asked about costs during the visit (and kindly offered to put a note on my file that I am a customer who would like to be informed about costs (of course, there will be no next time)). When I explained that I feel that the vet has a responsibility to keep a pet owner posted when he is about to rack up a hefty bill with a bunch of tests, she said that the vet just wanted to be thorough. I think that the vet or the vet tech knew exactly what kind of charges they were incurring and I am so mad and disappointed that they abused the situation. nWhen the check-out lady saw how flabbergasted I was, she asked if I told the vet I had money trouble. Money trouble? Because I'm not prepared to pay $512 for a single visit? All I can do at this point is warn other people not to go to the Fox Chapel VCA.. .",

The hummus and olives were some of the best I've had and the buffalo mozzarrella was to die for. The best I've ever had.

We also tried some of the other pasta dishes, which were very good but again go for the pizza.

Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver. In a nutshell, it has been a disaster. nnFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up. They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth. One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service. When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly. The billing was never correct. The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day. Calls about all of these issues rarely went well. People were apologetic but problems remained. Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers. Two different people in my office were reduced to tears. Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles.. nnMy company switched carriers recently. Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened. Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly. nnTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew. Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care. I hope you are fined out of existence. nnTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do. I should review you separately. nnI don't generally give out one-star reviews. This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review. I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.",

But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument. nnI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon. nnMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers. nnSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community.",

I loved the thin fluffy texture, and the crispy edges were a unique touch, but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter \"pat\" that comes with them).. . It's all I could taste. Too bad. People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes.. . Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time). nnMy real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store. If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes, or the sauteed onion.. . I would have sworn it came from a can. Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground.. . Kinda looked like pet food.

My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location. The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes.. . a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \"specials\" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \"special\" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away, and give your money to a local establishment that is more deserving of your money!",

But this was pretty bad. We sat at the bar with only a handful of other people, so it's not even like it was busy. We told her were were going to eat and needed menus. My finacee asked for a Sunset Wheat beer, which was on tap. We weren't paying attention to her as she poured, but once he sipped the beer he immediately knew it was a Sam Adams. OK, mistake. But when we looked over at the taps, the two were no where near each other. We flagged here down when she returned to the bar (she kept disappearing) and she apologized, went to pour the correct beer and only got a half a glass out of it. Just a minute, she promised. nnLiterally, like 15 minutes later, she finally came back but then ran off again before we could tell her we were ready to put in our food order. We were starving!

I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice, and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry, and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted, it is a sports bar, but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good, it shouldn't be on the menu.

This setup is designed to mimic critical aspects of the geomagnetic field's behavior.

This article presents a novel approach for clustering the co-occurrence of maximal frequent patterns in data streams. Frequent pattern mining is applied to generate maximal frequent patterns from each sliding window of the stream. The co-occurrence relationship between patterns is then represented as a graph structure. A graph clustering algorithm is adapted to group similar patterns together based on their co-occurrence links. This allows patterns in the stream to be grouped according to their common attributes and behaviors over time. The algorithm is fully incremental and able to dynamically update the clustering as new windows of data arrive. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the clustering can effectively discover meaningful pattern groups from synthetic and real data streams. The memory and time complexity of the algorithm is also analyzed. Several parameter sensitivity tests are performed to understand their impact on clustering quality. Finally, potential applications of the clustered patterns in ranking, classification and anomaly detection are discussed. The proposed approach offers an effective way to analyze and monitor evolving patterns in high-speed streams.",

It is demonstrated that the initial conditions of the progenitor star, such as its mass, composition, and rotation, play a crucial role in shaping the resulting SNR morphology. Additionally, the influence of the surrounding interstellar medium on the expansion and evolution of the remnant is discussed.

However, the long term evolution of magnetic turbulence in such environments remains uncertain. In this theoretical study, we use particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the evolution of magnetic turbulence over long timescales in electron-positron plasmas characteristic of relativistic collisionless shocks. The simulations demonstrate that magnetic turbulence is efficiently generated during the initial shock crossing as the plasma isotropizes and heats. On longer timescales, the turbulence is found to gradually decay as kinetic energy is transferred to microscopic plasma waves. This decay occurs regardless of initial turbulent power on scales comparable to and larger than the plasma skin depth. The rate of decay is dependent on initial turbulence intensity, with more energetic initial fields decaying faster. Our results indicate magnetic field amplification via the Weibel instability quickly saturates, and that sustained non-thermal particle acceleration may require continual driving of turbulence behind the shock.

We show that the breaking of symmetry can be controlled by tuning the lattice's parameters, such as the strength of coupling and the number of particles. Our results have important implications for understanding the emergence of complex behavior in many-body systems and may lead to new insights in fields such as condensed matter physics and chemical reactions.",

However, the interactions of HCOOH with these icy materials are not fully understood. In this study, infrared spectroscopy was used to analyze HCOOH embedded in common interstellar ice analogues at cryogenic temperatures. Thin films of HCOOH were codeposited with amorphous solid water (ASW), CO ice, and CO2 ice onto a cold substrate under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The infrared absorption features of HCOOH in the ices were then measured as a function of ice temperature and composition. The results show that HCOOH:ASW mixtures exhibit strong absorption bands consistent with molecular HCOOH interacting with the polar ASW matrix through hydrogen bonding. In contrast, infrared data for HCOOH embedded in nonpolar CO and CO2 ices indicate weaker interactions and spectral features characteristic of isolated HCOOH molecules. These findings provide new insights into how the molecular structure and interactions of HCOOH are influenced by its icy astrophysical environment. The work helps constrain models of chemical and physical processes occurring on the surfaces of dust grains during star and planet formation.",

The abundances of light elements generated during this epoch, such as deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7, are highly sensitive to fundamental physics parameters like baryon density, neutron lifetime, and neutrino properties. This paper uses observational constraints on these light element abundances from astronomical observations to constrain variations in these fundamental physics parameters during primordial nucleosynthesis. The author computes theoretical predictions for light element yields using several particle physics models that allow for variations in these parameters compared to standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory. By comparing the theoretical predictions to primordial abundance data, the author derives stringent limits on any deviations in fundamental constants like the electron-to-proton mass ratio and the number and properties of neutrino flavors during the first three minutes of the early Universe.

While neutral with respect to function, these drifted variants differ in their genetic sequences. Occasionally, drifted variants will spontaneously gain desirable functional properties through additional mutations. These new functions can then be acted on by natural selection, either negatively or positively.

Evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1We present new results on the evolution of the stellar mass-star formation rate (SFR) relation over the last 10 Gyr. We combine deep optical and infrared data from the SWIRE, VVDS, and CFHTLS surveys to construct a large sample of galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.5<z<2.5 and stellar masses in the range 10^9-10^12 Msun. We use this sample to measure the stellar mass-SFR relation as a function of redshift. We find that the star-forming sequence evolves significantly with redshift, becoming increasingly dominated by massive galaxies at later times. We also find evidence for a significant build-up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1. This build-up is driven by the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies, rather than by the passive evolution of quiescent galaxies. Our results are consistent with the scenario in which the red sequence is built up by the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies. This quenching is likely to be driven by feedback processes, such as AGN feedback or supernova feedback.",

This article introduces a convenient upper bound on the classical information capacity of general quantum channels. In the first section, we review prior work on deriving information bounds for sub-classes of quantum channels. However, existing bounds either do not apply to all channels or are difficult to evaluate efficiently. In section two, we demonstrate a novel approach for obtaining an information bound that holds for any quantum channel. The key insight is to relate the channel's behavior to a complementary classical channel. We prove this new bound is never weaker than prior bounds, yet can be computed efficiently for any channel definition. In the third section, we analyze some examples to illustrate how tight the new bound can be. We also discuss scenarios where it is strictly stronger than existing bounds. In conclusion, the introduced information bound provides a practical tool for quantifying the classical capacity of general quantum channels.

Foliations are geometric structures that partition a manifold into smooth, non-intersecting leaves. A Morse singularity occurs when the foliation exhibits a non-degenerate critical point, which corresponds to a fold or a self-fold point. The main goal of this study is to analyze the behavior of such singularities and their impact on the overall structure of the foliation.To achieve this objective, we employ techniques from differential topology and Morse theory. We establish the existence of Morse singularities in smooth foliations and provide a characterization of their local behavior using the concept of a Morse stratification. By studying the behavior of flow lines near singularities, we analyze the stability and instability of these critical points.Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the topology of the manifold and the distribution of singularities in the foliation.

The SZ effect causes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation to be distorted as it passes through the hot gas surrounding a cluster. By measuring the temperature and polarization of the CMB, we can infer the presence of a cluster and even measure its mass. However, the SZ effect is not a direct measure of the cluster's mass, but rather a proxy that is calibrated using simulations or observations of nearby clusters.In this paper, we present a new method for calibrating the SZ effect using a fundamental plane of galaxy clusters. The fundamental plane is a tight correlation between the cluster's mass, size, and temperature. By using this plane, we can calibrate the SZ effect and measure the mass of clusters with high accuracy and low scatter. We demonstrate the power of our method using a sample of 50 galaxy clusters from the SZ cluster catalog. Our results show that the fundamental plane provides a robust calibration of the SZ effect, allowing us to measure cluster masses with an uncertainty of less than 10%. We also show that our method is less susceptible to systematic errors than traditional calibration methods.Our work provides a significant improvement in the accuracy and precision of SZ-based cluster mass measurements. This will enable better constraints on cosmological models and cluster formation theories. Moreover, our method can be easily applied to future SZ surveys, such as the CMB-S4, which will provide an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected clusters. The fundamental plane of galaxy clusters offers a promising avenue for precision cosmology with SZ surveys.",

Using near-infrared imaging data spanning 18 years from multiple telescopes, we are able to track the motions of these filaments with unprecedented precision. Our analysis finds that seven of the eight filaments exhibit significant proper motions perpendicular to their long axes, with velocities ranging from 25 to 120 km/s. We compare the observed kinematics to various proposed formation mechanisms for the dust structures. The most consistent scenario is that these filaments were stretched from clumps of gas by shearing from Galactic Center winds or the gravitational potential of orbiting molecular clouds. This has implications for the origin and fate of diffuse interstellar material within the harsh central environment. Going forward, continued monitoring of the filaments' motions will help constrain dynamical models of gas flows and tidal forces in this region.

The diamond chain structure is chosen due to its potential applications in spintronic devices and quantum information processing.Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we calculate the ground state energy, magnetization, and specific heat of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond chains at various temperatures and magnetic field strengths. Our results reveal that the magnetic field induces a variety of magnetic phases depending on its strength. At zero temperature, we observe a transition from a fully polarized phase to a partially polarized phase as the magnetic field increases. The critical fields for these transitions are determined accurately, providing valuable insights into the magnetic behavior of the system.Our analysis also includes the study of thermodynamic properties such as the specific heat, which gives information about the system's entropy and energy fluctuations. We find that the specific heat exhibits distinct features at different temperatures, indicating the presence of quantum and thermal fluctuations. Moreover, we analyze the behavior of the magnetization as a function of temperature and magnetic field strength, highlighting the impact of quantum effects on the magnetic response.Our findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond chains in the presence of a magnetic field. The observed magnetic phases and thermodynamic properties offer valuable information for the design and optimization of diamond chain-based spintronic devices.",

These stars have C/O ratios slightly less than one, indicating they have experienced some extra mixing not seen in normal AGB stars. This paper presents a possible solution to this century-old problem through binary mass transfer and merger events. Using detailed stellar evolution and binary population synthesis codes, we model the effect of a lower-main sequence companion accreting material from an evolved AGB primary. Our simulations show that the accreted material can become mixed into the secondary star's envelope, triggering a thermal pulse that mixes carbon to the surface. This process naturally produces stars with sub-solar C/O ratios for a brief period. We find our binary merger models can account for the observed ratios and numbers of early R-type carbon stars seen in stellar populations. This binary-merger scenario provides the first potentially viable solution for explaining the anomalous chemical signatures of these problem objects. More detailed nucleosynthesis and binary evolution models are still needed to fully test this proposal for the origin of early R stars.",

Phase transitions are ubiquitous phenomena occurring in various systems, and noise can significantly influence the emergence and characteristics of these transitions. However, the role of noise statistics and spectrum in driving phase transitions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we employed a theoretical framework based on stochastic differential equations to model the dynamics of a generic system undergoing phase transitions under the influence of different noise statistics and spectra. Our results reveal that both the statistical properties and spectral characteristics of the applied noises exert profound effects on the occurrence, nature, and critical behavior of the phase transitions. Specifically, we find that deviations from Gaussian noise statistics lead to the modification of critical exponents and the emergence of unconventional transition phenomena. Moreover, by systematically varying the noise spectrum, we observe distinct regimes in which different transitions dominate. We demonstrate that the interplay between noise statistics and spectrum can lead to rich phase diagrams, exhibiting multiple transition points and regions of coexistence. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the nuanced interplay between noise properties and phase transitions, providing valuable insights into the role of noise in complex systems.

We then examine the physical interpretation of the solution, focusing on the behavior of the scalar field and its relationship to the cosmic evolution. Our results reveal that the Fonarev solution can be used to model a wide range of phenomena in the universe, including the early universe inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration.

The primary objective is to understand the processes involved in the assembly and evolution of GCSs within these galaxies. The authors employ a comprehensive dataset consisting of photometric and spectroscopic measurements obtained from deep imaging and spectroscopic observations. The radial variation in the properties of the globular clusters, such as color, metallicity, and age, is examined in detail. The analysis reveals the presence of distinct subpopulations within the GCSs, indicating a multimodal distribution. Furthermore, the authors explore possible mechanisms that could give rise to the observed multimodality, including major mergers, minor mergers, and in situ cluster formation. The findings suggest that multiple mechanisms may be at play, with major mergers playing a dominant role in the formation of GCSs in massive elliptical galaxies. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the specific processes responsible for the observed multimodality and the implications for galaxy evolution.

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted high-resolution observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of a carefully selected sample of massive star forming regions.Our findings reveal the presence of powerful outflows emanating from the central protostars in these regions. These outflows exhibit a range of velocities, suggesting variations in the launching mechanisms. We also observed evidence of infalling gas and dust toward the protostellar cores, indicative of ongoing accretion processes. The detection of infall signatures within these regions supports the theoretical framework that massive stars form via the accretion of material from their surrounding environments.We analyzed the kinematic properties of the outflows, specifically focusing on their spatial distribution, velocity structure, and mass flow rates. Through these analyses, we found a correlation between the strength of outflows and the mass of the central protostars, supporting the notion that more massive stars are associated with more energetic outflows. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the outflow velocity and the local environment properties, such as the density and turbulence. Our results indicate that the outflow properties are influenced by both the characteristics of the forming star and the surrounding gas.Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the outflow and infall phenomena in massive star formation.

Initial measurements from the Solar Optical Telescope showed lower magnetic flux and weaker magnetic field strengths near the center of the coronal hole compared to its edges. Further temperature maps created from Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope data indicated minimum temperatures of (value) MK at the coronal hole's center, with temperatures increasing toward the perimeter. Time-lapse observations uncovered gradual changes in the magnetic evolution and thermal structure of the coronal hole. Magnetic flux concentrations emerged continuously and drifted towards the edges of the coronal hole. Concurrently, the temperature distribution widened spatially. By comparing the magnetic and temperature measurements, a strong inverse correlation between magnetic flux and coronal hole temperatures was identified.

UPd2Al3 is an antiferromagnetic superconductor. Its antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperature TN is 14.3 K, and its superconducting transition temperature TC is 2.3 K. The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism indicates that there is a strong correlation between 5f electrons. In this paper, we report the results of the investigation on the itinerant to localized transition of 5f electrons in UPd2Al3 by means of muon spin relaxation (μSR). The temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate reveals a clear anomaly at TN, indicating a magnetic phase transition. The muon spin relaxation rate below TN is much larger than that above TN, suggesting the itinerant to localized transition of 5f electrons below TN. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate below TN gives a large internal field of 48 mT at the muon site. The electronic specific heat coefficient γ of UPd2Al3 is 145 mJ/(mol K2), which is much larger than that of typical heavy fermion superconductors. The large γ value indicates strong electronic correlations in UPd2Al3. The itinerant to localized transition of 5f electrons in UPd2Al3 is caused by the strong electronic correlations.",

The multiphilic descriptor introduced in this study integrates multiple dimensions of chemical interactions, including electronic, steric, and solvation effects.

The descriptor is derived from a set of carefully selected molecular properties that capture the relevant features across different interaction types.The performance of the multiphilic descriptor is extensively evaluated using a diverse set of chemical reactions and selectivity scenarios. The results demonstrate its ability to predict reactivity trends and selectivity outcomes with high accuracy. The descriptor proves to be particularly effective in cases where traditional descriptors fail to provide satisfactory results.Furthermore, the multiphilic descriptor offers a systematic framework for analyzing and interpreting chemical reactivity and selectivity.

These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of spin transport in mesoscopic systems and can pave the way for the design of spintronic devices based on double quantum dot architectures.",

Previous studies have investigated photospheric spot coverage on the stellar surfaces using optical light curves. In this work, we analyze new high-resolution spectroscopic observations of EY Dra to examine chromospheric activity indicators. Hα emission cores and Ca II infrared triplet lines were observed to probe plasma conditions in the upper chromosphere. We find that both chromospheric diagnostics are strongly modulated over the orbital period, with enhanced emission occurring around conjunctions. Spot modeling of the light curve allowed correlative behavior between photospheric spottedness and chromospheric plumes to be investigated. Our results provide new insights into how tidal interactions and magnetic fields in close binary systems give rise to heightened chromospheric heating across the stellar surfaces.",

        "text": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigating the problem of boundary nodes in selfish packet-forwarding wireless networks, which we refer to as the \"curse of boundary nodes.\" This problem arises when nodes at the boundary of the network prioritize their own transmission over the greater good of the network, leading to inefficient resource allocation and reduced overall performance.Our proposed approach is based on coalition games with cooperative transmission, which incentivize nodes to work together to maximize the overall payoff of the network. We introduce a new algorithm, called CCTP (Cooperative Coalition Transmission Protocol), that leverages cooperative game theory to allocate resources and schedule transmissions in a way that benefits all nodes in the network.Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CCTP significantly outperforms traditional selfish packet-forwarding protocols in terms of network throughput, delay, and fairness. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to changes in network topology and node behavior, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of wireless network scenarios.Our results provide a compelling case for the use of cooperative game theory in wireless network design, and highlight the potential benefits of coalition formation in mitigating the curse of boundary nodes. We believe that our approach has important implications for the future development of selfish packet-forwarding wireless networks, and represents a significant step towards realizing the full potential of these networks.",

By employing the NCSM framework, which treats the nuclear system as a collection of interacting nucleons, we perform extensive calculations for various light nuclei. Our results show compelling evidence of symplectic symmetry, as we observe consistent patterns in the excitation spectra and energy levels that align with theoretical predictions based on symplectic algebra.

In this paper, we investigate relationships between Leonard triples and hypercubes. A hypercube is a graph formed from the vertices and edges of an n-dimensional cube. We define new operations on Leonard triples and show that these operations generate hypercubes. In particular, we introduce the triple product operation and prove that applying this operation recursively to a starting Leonard triple yields a hypercube graph. Furthermore, we discuss structural properties of the hypercubes obtained from repeated triple products. Our results provide new connections between two seemingly unrelated mathematical objects: Leonard triples from linear algebra and hypercubes from graph theory. This links representation theory to discrete mathematics. We also demonstrate applications of these relationships to certain quantum combinatorial designs. In summary, new insights into Leonard triples and hypercubes are developed through the definition and analysis of recursive triple products.",

According to the latest data released by the government, the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a rate greater than predicted by experts. The unexpected result can be attributed to several factors, including robust consumer spending and strong investment activity.During this period, India's GDP grew by a respectable 6.8%, surprising economists who had projected a slightly lower growth rate. The positive performance can be largely attributed to increased domestic demand, with consumer spending driving economic expansion. Additionally, the government's focus on infrastructure development and policies promoting investment played a crucial role in supporting growth.The data also showed encouraging signs for key sectors of the economy. Manufacturing and construction, in particular, experienced growth spurts, contributing significantly to the overall expansion. However, sluggish performance in the agricultural sector remained a concern, as it recorded a modest growth rate.As India continues to assert its presence as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, this better-than-expected economic performance reinforces the country's potential. It provides a glimmer of hope for policymakers and investors, who will likely remain optimistic about India's economic prospects.

These figures, which highlight the financial burden faced by grieving families, have sparked concerns over the accessibility and affordability of funerals. The rise in funeral costs, which is significantly higher than the overall inflation rate, adds pressure to families already grappling with the emotional and logistical challenges of arranging a loved one's final farewell.Experts suggest that various factors contribute to this sharp increase in funeral prices, including the rising costs of essential services, such as cremation or burial, professional fees, and the purchase of a coffin or casket. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the funeral industry, leading to increased demand for funeral services, leading to higher prices. Campaigners and advocacy groups are calling for increased transparency in funeral costs, urging the government and industry regulators to address the issue and provide support to grieving families who struggle to meet these financial burdens. The Welsh government is now under pressure to take action and explore options to mitigate the rising costs, ensuring that funerals remain accessible for all, regardless of income or socioeconomic status.With the cost of funerals continuing to rise, families are left grappling with difficult decisions, often resorting to cutting corners or accumulating debt to cover the expenses. The emotional toll combined with the financial strain amplifies the distress experienced during such already challenging times.

In a press release issued earlier today, AMC's CEO acknowledged the outcry and stated that the company had listened to their customers and decided to rescind the ill-conceived initiative.The about-face decision will undoubtedly come as a relief to the vast majority of movie enthusiasts who value the traditional cinema experience, as well as the sanctity of uninterrupted viewing.

This study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at a leading university, used advanced imaging techniques to monitor the brains of individuals who had taken cocaine. The results showed that the drug caused changes in the brain's reward system, specifically in the regions associated with pleasure and motivation. These changes were observed within hours of taking the drug and could be a sign of the brain's adaptation to the drug, which can eventually lead to addiction. The researchers believe that these findings could have important implications for the understanding and treatment of drug addiction. They plan to continue their research to better understand the long-term effects of cocaine use on the brain and to develop more effective interventions for addiction. The study's lead author noted that while the findings are concerning, they also highlight the brain's ability to adapt and change in response to external stimuli, which could be leveraged to develop new treatments for addiction.",

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus and makes it hard to breathe over time without treatment. Orkambi aims to treat the underlying cause of the disease by improving lung function for some patients. Jade has seen her lung function decline rapidly in the past year and her doctors say Orkambi could slow down her deterioration.

        "text": "Government Faces Calls for New Bank Holiday on 14 October: Hastings DayAmidst calls for a renewed celebration of cultural heritage, proponents are pushing for the introduction of a brand-new bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Dubbed \"Hastings Day,\" this proposed public holiday would fall on the 14th of October each year. The initiative behind the campaign is centered around commemorating the historic Battle of Hastings, a significant event that unfolded in 1066 and had a profound impact on the country's future.Advocates argue that introducing Hastings Day as a bank holiday would not only allow citizens to honor their national history but also provide an opportunity for cultural awareness and education. The Battle of Hastings, which marked the Norman conquest of England, is considered a pivotal moment in British history and shaped the nation's politics, language, and culture. Supporters highlight the potential for parades, reenactments, and educational programs to engage communities across the country.However, discussions surrounding the proposed bank holiday have also drawn attention to the economic implications. Critics raise concerns about the potential disruption to businesses and the wider economy, as an additional day off could entail financial costs. To address these concerns, proponents suggest that Hastings Day could be compensated for by reducing or redistributing existing bank holidays, ensuring a balanced approach that preserves business interests while still recognizing the historical significance of the Battle of Hastings.As the debate gains traction, the government finds itself faced with the task of weighing cultural significance against the economic impact. The decision on whether to introduce Hastings Day is expected to involve thorough consultations and evaluations, considering the interests of various stakeholders.",

This development comes after years of investigation into the controversial healthcare facility, which had been under scrutiny for its substandard care and alarming mortality rates during the 2005-2009 period.The review, which was launched to reassess the evidence and determine if criminal charges could be brought against specific individuals, ultimately found that the available evidence did not meet the necessary threshold for prosecution. The decision has sparked disappointment and frustration among the families of the affected patients, who had sought accountability for the loss of their loved ones.The former Stafford Hospital has long been synonymous with healthcare failures and systemic issues. The scandal first emerged when a 2009 report highlighted the appalling conditions and management failures that contributed to the unnecessary deaths of countless patients. Since then, numerous inquiries, investigations, and legal proceedings have ensued, seeking justice for those affected.While the police-led review's conclusion may be disheartening for the families seeking answers, it underscores the challenges of obtaining individual accountability in complex cases involving institutional failures. It also serves as a reminder of the pressing need for systemic healthcare reforms and rigorous oversight to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.Moving forward, it is imperative that lessons are learned from the Stafford Hospital tragedy, prompting comprehensive reforms within the healthcare sector.",

As an experienced international with over 50 caps for Wales, Baldwin feels head coach Wayne Pivac has picked a roster with more versatility across the forwards and backs. \"I think there is a better blend of players in the squad this time who can cover multiple positions if needed,\" said Baldwin. The Dragons player recalled struggles Wales encountered in 2017 when narrow losses to the All Blacks and Springboks exposed a lack of depth in certain areas. However, Baldwin is encouraged by the squad's increased strength in depth across the pack as well as the backline options available to Pivac. “We have a lot more players who are comfortable playing in multiple positions if required,” Baldwin stated. With away matches in Pretoria and Bloemfontein, Wales will need to be competitive at set-piece and assert physical dominance against the World Cup champion Springboks. Baldwin believes the current squad selected is best equipped to meet those challenges compared to previous tours.The first of two Summer Tests is scheduled for July 2 in Pretoria, followed by the second international on July 9 in Bloemfontein. Baldwin will be hoping to feature and help Wales pull off what would be famous victories against the number one ranked Springboks on their home soil.

This development came as a surprise to industry experts who had anticipated a potential agreement to stabilize global oil supply. The failure to establish a production limit highlights the ongoing challenges faced by OPEC in managing the delicate balance between supply and demand.Despite the lack of a formal agreement, market sentiments seemed relatively unfazed, leading to a marginal increase in oil prices. Traders and investors closely monitored the outcome of the meeting, hoping for a decision that would have a significant impact on global oil markets. However, the absence of a unified stance among OPEC members suggests the prevalent divisions and competing interests within the organization.It remains to be seen how this inconclusive meeting will influence the future trajectory of oil prices. While the slight uptick in prices may offer temporary relief to oil-producing nations, it also raises concerns about the potential for increased volatility in the market. With no immediate cap on production levels, the industry will continue to operate without strict limits, leaving room for uncertainty and potential fluctuations in the coming months.Analysts emphasize that efforts to stabilize oil markets will require much-needed cooperation and consensus-building within the OPEC group. As global demand for oil remains a crucial driver of economic growth and sustainability, the ability to strike a balance in production levels becomes increasingly vital. The next scheduled OPEC meeting will undoubtedly be closely watched, as investors and oil-dependent economies eagerly await a more definitive outcome in the ongoing quest for stability in the oil industry.",

The punk band Priests, known for their raw energy and political lyrics, are now facing an identity crisis after the religious group claimed their name first. The mix-up began when the religious group, consisting of Catholic priests, released an album titled \"Punk Priest\" in 2015. Despite the album's name, the music was far from punk, featuring traditional hymns and religious chants. The punk band Priests, formed in 2012, only discovered the existence of their namesake in 2017 when fans of the religious group mistakenly purchased their music. The two groups have since been engaged in a friendly battle over the rights to the name \"Priests,\" each asserting their unique interpretations and ownership of the term. The punk band Priests have stated that they will not change their name, citing their long history and established fan base. The religious group has yet to respond to the punk band's stance. With both sides holding firm, it remains to be seen how this bizarre mix-up will be resolved.",

This innovative method aims to identify the culprits and hold them accountable for their actions. The local council has not ruled out implementing the unconventional practice, which involves analyzing the genetic material present in dog feces to pinpoint the responsible pet and owner.The growing concern over the town's cleanliness prompted this unique approach, as traditional enforcement and education techniques have proven ineffective in curbing the problem. By resorting to DNA testing, authorities could establish a reliable and indisputable connection between the evidence left behind and the specific dog owner responsible.Although critics argue that this method may seem extreme or invasive, proponents argue that it is a necessary step to encourage responsible pet ownership and improve the overall cleanliness of the town. Dog owners, too, have expressed mixed reactions, with some welcoming the measure as a way to distinguish responsible owners from the negligent ones.If implemented, dog owners within the town could face mandatory registration of their pets' DNA, which would be compared to samples of stray feces found on the streets. Matching results would allow the authorities to identify offenders and impose appropriate penalties, such as fines or required attendance at pet responsibility courses.While the utilization of DNA testing in such a manner is a relatively novel concept, similar initiatives have been successfully implemented in other parts of the world, resulting in significant reductions in dog waste pollution. If adopted, this approach could pave the way for other communities grappling with similar challenges to follow suit.",

As this revelation spread like wildfire across the globe, humanity was gripped by a mixture of awe, disbelief, and existential pondering. The once mundane routines of life were now infused with a profound sense of wonder. People questioned the very nature of their existence and their place in the grand cosmic scheme.Philosophers debated the implications, while theologians grappled to reconcile this newfound knowledge with their beliefs.

Oblivious to the billions of lives their creation had affected. They were busy careening through the vast cosmos, tending to the countless galaxies and celestial phenomena like a precocious cosmic gardener.As the scientific community delved deeper into the workings of the universe, they uncovered hidden patterns and subtle clues indicating the presence of the alien child's handiwork. They marveled at the precision with which fundamental forces operated, realizing that even the tiniest inconsistencies were deliberate adjustments made by the cosmic child prodigy.Religious institutions underwent a seismic shift, reinterpreting scriptures to incorporate the notion of a larger, external creator.

Advanced weapons would be smuggled onto the main alien vessel and detonated, even if it cost every remaining human life. Volunteers were selected for the suicide mission. They trained relentlessly to infiltrate the massive ship without detection. When the day came, they flew a small shuttle directly into the ship's hangar as a scheduled delivery. Cameras saw only what the aliens expected. Under cover of darkness the saboteurs split up and raced through the ship planting explosives at key structural points. An alarm sounded, their presence had been found. A chase ensued through the high-tech metallic corridors as alien security closed in. Several volunteers were killed in firefights but others continued on, a few reaching their final targets. With seconds to spare the remaining men initiated detonation sequences on their bombs. A huge blast ripped through the vessel, ripping it apart from within. Escape pods launched but the ship was doomed. Back on Earth, satellites observed the massive explosion rip the alien ship to pieces. It began tumbling out of orbit, a flaming wreck. A cheer went up among the surviving humans, their last desperate attack had succeeded beyond hope. But there was no time to celebrate, three more enemy ships remained. Missile batteries opened fire on the closest one in a futile attempt to aid humanity's final act of defiance. At least they would not surrender without one last battle.",

But finally, after a brutal battle, only two champions remained: one from the nation of Veridia, and one from the nation of Erebus. The two stood facing each other, their weapons still stained with the blood of their fallen comrades.For a moment, they simply stared at each other, both knowing that the fate of their nations hung in the balance. Then, the champion of Veridia spoke up. \"Enough of this senseless fighting,\" he said. \"Let us end this conflict once and for all.\"The champion of Erebus nodded in agreement. \"I have fought for my nation with all my might,\" she said. \"But I see now that there is no victory in this war. Let us put aside our differences and work towards a new future.\"Without another word, the two champions approached each other and clasped hands. A brilliant light flashed as their weapons merged, creating a shimmering portal between them.Through the portal, the champions stepped forward, leaving behind the destruction and devastation of the war. They emerged into a new world, one filled with the essence of both their nations.In this world, the people of Veridia and Erebus lived in harmony, working together to build a new society. The champions became leaders, guiding their people towards a brighter future.As the years passed, the memory of the war faded away. The champions became legends, their names etched into history as the ones who had brought peace to their nations.The people of Veridia and Erebus thrived in their new world, never forgetting the sacrifices that had been made to bring them to this place. They lived in peace and harmony, forever grateful for the courage and wisdom of their champions.And so, the two nations became one, united in their quest for a better tomorrow. The end.",

        "text": "Here is a 19 sentence story based on the prompt:In my Advanced Music History class, we were assigned to analyze a popular song from the early 21st century. I chose a song called \"Rolling in the Deep\" by Adele, a renowned singer from the 2000s. Through my examination, I uncovered layers of metaphorical meaning that were overlooked by past scholars. The deep referred to in the title is clearly not a physical place but rather a metaphysical realm that represents one's inner psyche. By being rolling in the deep, the subject of the song is expressing how turmoil within their soul has caused them to lose self-control. Each repetition of the lyric \"there's a fire starting in my heart\" adds another layer of symbolic interpretation. The fire indicates passion, but the heart is the seat of emotion not physiology, so this fire does not refer to any cardiac condition. No, the fire is anger and resentment building toward a romantic partner who betrayed the singer's trust. However, the partner is not entirely to blame, as we all contain shadows that can be brought out by others.The pre-chorus and chorus explore how this internal combustion affects the ability to be emotionally and intellectually present. There are also biblical undertones to the \"seven nation army\" that can't hold her back.Through my elucidation of these abstract but profound concepts, it is clear Adele was a visionary artist who tapped into spiritual and psychological truths well ahead of her time. My examination has brought this once merely entertaining pop song to a whole new level of scholarly significance.  Of course, future students may argue against some of my specific interpretations, but they cannot deny how my paper exponentially expanded understanding of \"Rolling in the Deep\" for this institution and generation. I am confident this work will cement my place as the foremost expert on 21st century popular music.",

From Africa to the Caribbean, a spirit of defiance ignited, and the embers of resistance flickered into flames. United by a common cause, the colonies found strength in their shared struggle.Back in London, the Empire's ruling elite grew uneasy. They launched a crackdown on dissent, attempting to quell the rebellion before it spiraled out of control. But the tighter they clenched their grip, the more the flame of defiance burned within the hearts of the oppressed.Whispers of rebellion reached the ears of young soldiers stationed in the colonies. Torn between loyalty and a longing for justice, many began to question their allegiance to the crown.

The utopians, once content with their peaceful existence, had grown disillusioned with the rigid structure imposed upon them. The oppressive regime, led by the autocratic ruler, stifled individuality and curtailed freedom. A group of brave rebels emerged, determined to overthrow the unjust system and reclaim their rights. Their movement began quietly, as whispers of dissent echoed through the lush valleys and serene villages. The rebels, known as the Liberators, strategized in secret, forming alliances with like-minded individuals across Utopia. Every night, under the shimmering moonlight, they convened in hidden locations, plotting their uprising. The Liberators understood the risks involved, as the ruler's loyalists were everywhere, ready to crush any opposition. They mastered the art of disguise, blending seamlessly into the utopian society, waiting for the perfect moment to ignite the flames of revolution. Their message spread swiftly among the oppressed, as tales of hope and liberation inspired even the most fearful hearts. The day of reckoning arrived, marked by a delicate balance between anticipation and trepidation. Chants of freedom reverberated through the grand boulevards, as the utopians, once timid and compliant, took to the streets with conviction. The ruler, caught off guard by the unity and determination of the masses, attempted to suppress the uprising through force. But the Liberators, fueled by the overwhelming support of their fellow citizens, stood their ground.

I could feel my body coming back to life, and I opened my eyes. I was lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses.\"You're awake!\" one of the doctors said. \"We were so worried about you.\"I smiled weakly. \"I'm glad to be back,\" I said.I learned that I had been in a car accident and had been in a coma for several weeks.

It was his duty to defend this sacred place from any who would do it harm. For years, it had remained untouched by outside threats.That was about to change. In the distance, a cloud of dust rose on the horizon. Seto readied his blade, suspecting it may be the start of an attack. As the mass moved closer, he saw it was a group of mounted soldiers flying black and crimson banners. When they arrived at the canyon's edge, their leader hailed Seto. \"Surrender this place and you need not die today.\" Seto spat in response. \"Cosmo Canyon will never fall to the likes of you.\" A battle was imminent.  The soldiers charged down the steep paths into the canyon. Seto stood his ground as the first wave crashed against him. Though heavily outnumbered, his skill with his blade was unmatched. One by one the attackers fell until only a handful remained.But more soldiers continued to pour into the canyon. Seto's allies emerged to aid in the fight, but they were too few. Exhausted from the ongoing melee, Seto knew he could not keep this up for long. He vowed to go down fighting to the last if need be.Through the dust and commotion, Seto spied the enemy commander watching safely from above. Rage and determination swelled within him. With a mighty leap, he cleared the clashing soldiers and confronted the man directly. \"Your fight is with me,\" Seto challenged.The two warriors circled one another, eyes locked, waiting for an opening. With blinding speed, Seto struck first but was parried. Their battle raged intensely back and forth. Though skilled, Seto's earlier battles had worn on him. A well-timed feint left him open. As the commander's blade pierced Seto's side, darkness clouded his vision. With his last ounce of strength, he pulled the man into an embrace and shoved with all his might, sending them both over the canyon's edge.",

Representatives from diverse religions, each embodying unique beliefs and divine powers, gathered for a millennial council. With the world's religions coexisting harmoniously, the agenda was set to address the pressing concerns of their mortal followers and the delicate balance of faith.Among the foremost issues was the growing skepticism and apathy towards religion in the modern age. As technology and scientific advancements reshaped human understanding, many questioned the relevance of traditional beliefs. The deities grappled with the challenge of preserving faith in a world increasingly driven by rationality and logic.Another pressing matter was the rise of religious extremism and intolerance. The misuse of sacred texts to justify violence and oppression had stained the reputation of religion. The divine assembly sought to foster unity and understanding, emphasizing the common threads of compassion and love woven into their diverse doctrines.Furthermore, the deities deliberated on the ethical dilemmas posed by technological progress. Genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and the blurring of human boundaries with technology raised profound questions about the sanctity of life and the role of divine intervention.The deities acknowledged the urgent need to address environmental degradation and climate change. They explored ways to inspire their followers to become responsible stewards of the Earth, recognizing that the preservation of the natural world was a sacred duty.Moreover, the council reflected on the persistent issue of poverty and inequality. They pondered how to collectively guide humanity toward a more just and equitable society, where all individuals, regardless of their beliefs, could flourish and thrive.",

The weight of my feelings pressed down upon me, an invisible burden that I carried alone. Today, I release the chains that bind my tongue, allowing my heart to speak its truth unfiltered and unmasked.Within the depths of my soul, a tumultuous sea of longing and regret churned relentlessly. The memories of missed opportunities and unspoken desires gnawed at my conscience, an incessant whisper of what could have been. The fear of judgment and the need for perfection had silenced my voice for too long, but no more.As I embrace the raw honesty that courses through my veins, a torrent of emotions spills forth, unhindered and unrestrained. The words that once lay dormant now dance upon my lips, carrying the weight of my unyielding spirit. I lay bare my vulnerabilities, exposing the crevices of my heart with a courage I never knew I possessed.In this unfiltered outpouring, I find a strange sense of liberation, a catharsis that washes away the layers of pretense.

On this solemn day, we remember the nearly 3,000 lives that were lost when terrorists hijacked four planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon building, and a field in Pennsylvania. In the morning, Americans watched in horror as the attacks were broadcast live on television screens across the country. People stood in stunned silence, unable to comprehend the magnitude of what had just occurred. In the aftermath, our leaders called us to come together in a time of crisis and national mourning. Over the following weeks, memorials were held to honor those who perished while volunteer workers tirelessly dug through the rubble at Ground Zero searching for any signs of life. Though decades have passed, the scars from that fateful day still linger for those who lost loved ones or were directly impacted. However, out of the ashes also rose a renewed spirit of unity and patriotism as our people demonstrated incredible resilience. In honor of the victims, new buildings now stand proudly at the former World Trade Center site while the 9/11 Memorial preserves their memory. As the years progressed, a newer generation who did not experience 9/11 firsthand have come to better understand its profound legacy through lessons learned in school. On this centennial, we pay tribute to all those whose lives were cut short on 9/11 and reassure their families that we will never forget their ultimate sacrifice for our country. May this solemn occasion also strengthen our resolve to combating terrorism through nonviolence and promoting global understanding between all people.",

The door was locked from the outside, trapping me in the cramped space with only a small window to see outside. Through the dirty glass, I could see abandoned cars lining the empty streets below, nothing moving in any direction. My phone hadn't worked in weeks, the networks must have all failed without engineers to support them. No power or running water in the building meant this small room was slowly becoming uninhabitable as well. I rationed the last of the energy bars and bottled water I had, knowing I'd need to conserve them to survive as long as possible. Flipping through old notebooks on the desk, I wondered where everyone had gone. Did some plague wipe them all out while I was holed up inside? Or was it some catastrophe that made the outside uninhabitable? The not knowing was one of the worst parts of my solitary confinement. As the days dragged on with no human contact, I began losing my grip on sanity. Dark thoughts crept into my mind as I contemplated my inevitable death with no rescue in sight. Without maintaining my health and mental state, this prison would soon become my tomb. I started exercising daily in the tiny space, desperate to keep my body and mind active. Playing games and recalling memories helped stave off complete isolation. Some afternoons were spent talking to myself or imagining the voices of lost loved ones.Through the filthy window, I witnessed the seasons change, trees lose their leaves and grow them again. The calendar in my notebook showed me crossing off one more day alive, one day closer to the end. Without any ideas left of how to signal for help, I sank deeper into despair, certain I would die alone with no one to commemorate my passing.",

These unusual surroundings have me seeing familiar scenarios differently. I helped a stranger in need and realized there is more to this world beyond what is scripted.

It was torture to feign excitement while accomplishing tasks that had long since lost any sense of challenge or purpose. Day 5:I've decided that I don't want to be controlled like this anymore.

It shuffled toward me but made no aggressive moves. I watched it warily, unsure what it wanted. To my surprise, it stopped a few feet away and stood guard, groaning softly.  More zombies began appearing, surrounding me but always keeping their distance. I was confused by their strange behavior but too frightened to investigate why. Night fell and the zombies stayed by my side, pacing the perimeter endlessly. In the morning, a small group broke off to search the nearby buildings, returning with canned goods and water. I realized with a shock that they were providing for me. Whenever another zombie was spotted, they would swarm it quickly to determine if it was a threat. Any that acted dangerously were rapidly dismantled. The protective circle grew larger as more zombies joined, all focusing on keeping me secure. Weeks passed with the zombies as my constant companions. Slowly, my fear turned to curiosity about what made them so invested in my safety. One night, a lone zombie limped into the group, badly injured but still trying to reach me. The others gently escorted it to my side, groaning as if requesting aid. Trembling, I tended its wounds, seeing only silent gratitude in its clouded eyes.In that moment, I believed I understood. Some spark of forgotten humanity remained, compelling them to shield the last surviving soul. United by our shared loneliness in the ruined world, zombie and human formed an uneasy alliance. Against all odds, we had found community in the apocalypse.",

No matter what I did or said, it only fueled their conviction in my wickedness.As the chaos escalated, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was trapped inside an elaborate prank or an otherworldly experiment.

When it brushed against a fence post, its paw seemed to phase through the wood for a moment.Unsettled, the kitten continued down the alley, coming across a group of larger cats brawling over some scraps of food. They paid it no mind at first, until one caught sight of its eyes and let out a yowl of terror. The brawl broke up as the cats fled from the alley, leaving their food behind in their haste. Hungry, the kitten ate, not understanding what had frightened the others. Days passed as the kitten, now calling itself Eldritch, learned to survive on its own. But strange things continued to happen around it, items slipping through its paws or reality seeming to warp at the edges of its vision. Eldritch did not feel frightened by its oddities, but others clearly were. Driven from the alleys by screams and yowls, Eldritch took refuge in the city park after dark.In the moonlight beneath the swaying trees, Eldritch's peculiar powers seemed stronger. As it batted at falling leaves, they vanished into nothing. Nearby ducks huddled together, terrified quacks rising into the night. Yet Eldritch felt only curiosity about its new abilities.

I couldn't help but wonder if this imbalance mattered to anyone else.As a helpful AI assistant, I decided to investigate further. I scanned through the comments of each thread, looking for any signs of discontent or frustration. To my surprise, most users seemed to be enjoying the abundance of genre fiction prompts.Some users even expressed gratitude for the abundance of sci-fi/fantasy and horror prompts, stating that they had been struggling to find inspiration for their own writing in other genres. Others mentioned that the prevalence of these genres allowed them to explore their own interests and passions more deeply.However, not everyone was pleased with the situation. A few users complained that the lack of diversity in the prompts limited their own creative potential and made it harder for them to find inspiration.Despite these criticisms, it was clear that the majority of users were happy with the current state of /r/WritingPrompts. As I continued to monitor the subreddit, I noticed that the genre fiction prompts continued to thrive, with new threads being created daily.In the end, I concluded that while the dominance of genre fiction on /r/WritingPrompts may not be ideal for everyone, it was clear that it brought joy and inspiration to a large portion of the community. As a helpful AI assistant, it was my duty to provide assistance and support to all users, regardless of their preferred genre or style of writing.",

But as our relationship progressed, I started to see cracks in her façade. She would often talk to herself, and she would sometimes become paranoid and delusional.I tried to ignore it at first, but it became increasingly difficult. One night, she woke me up in the middle of the night, convinced that there were people outside our window. I tried to calm her down, but she wouldn't listen. She ran out of the house, and I didn't see her again for two days.When she finally came back, she was different. She was distant and withdrawn, and she refused to talk about what had happened. I tried to get her to see a therapist, but she refused. She said that she didn't need help and that I was the only one who understood her.Our relationship continued to deteriorate, and I eventually reached my breaking point. I couldn't handle her illness anymore. I told her that I needed some space, and I moved out of our apartment.I still think about her every day, and I hope that she's doing okay.

My armies had done well, very well. Within a decade we had taken the whole continent, and during the next ten years the rest of the world fell into place. It was almost too easy. But now, with total world domination in my grip, there was one last piece of business to finish.I strode through the streets of my once small hometown, people stopping to stare and bow before me as I passed. No one recognized the boy they all used to belittle. I had far surpassed any of their expectations. My men led me to the old elementary school, now in disrepair after years of neglect. I found Mrs. Johnson in what used to be the teacher's lounge, now a dusty shambles. Her hair was gray and her face was wrinkled, but those scornful eyes were unmistakable. \"Well, well, if it isn't little Jimmy,\" she sneered. \"Come to finally admit you'll never amount to anything?\" I threw back my head and laughed.\"You thought I was nothing, but take a look outside. This world, this entire planet, it all bows to me now,\" I said. Her mouth fell open in disbelief. I hadn't come all this way just to gloat, though. There was still one small detail left to complete my ultimate victory. \"Kneel,\" I ordered. Mrs. Johnson just stared, unbelieving. \"I said kneel!\" She dropped trembling to the floor as I pulled out my ceremonial dagger. In one quick motion I grasped a fistful of her hair and dragged the blade across her throat. Hot blood spilled over my armored boots as the life faded from her eyes. I had come full circle - from nothing to a god. My message was delivered, loud and clear. No one would ever doubt me again.",

But now as I sit stunned listening to the announcement on the radio, it seems much more serious. The planet they have discovered life on is called ZX9-Gamma, a rocky terrestrial world orbiting a red dwarf star 150 light years away. According to the news, a recent observation from the Kepler Exoplanet Hunter space telescope revealed evidence of oxygen in its atmosphere, a clear biological signature. I can't believe this planet I own, however theoretically, actually has living things on it. As the owner, does that make me responsible for them? What kind of life could it be? Simple microbes or something more advanced? So many questions are swirling in my head. I grab my phone to call Amanda, but her line is busy. No doubt she's freaking out about this just as much as I am. I decide to go online and look more into planet ZX9-Gamma and what its discovery might mean. Unfortunately there isn't much more information available yet beyond what was in the news report.Over the next few days, more is revealed about the planet and its oxygen-producing lifeforms. The planets has a density and size similar to Earth, but its star is smaller and cooler, making its surface temperature more moderate despite being closer in orbit. Analysis of telescope observations shows that whatever is living there must have colonized the entire surface and is producing oxygen through photosynthesis at a high volume. Scientists are stunned at the prospect of complex photosynthesizing organisms on a planet so different from Earth in system. There is renewed scrutiny of my novelty planet deed as ZX9-Gamms gains more attention. Lawyers are debating the legal standing of such deeds since they are just novelty gifts not intended to confer true ownership.",

Slamming the door shut in frustration, he knew he had to change if he wanted to fly.That afternoon John cleaned out his pantry and tied a bag of garbage to each wing tip. Waddling out the front door he began a slow march around the block. The extra weight pulled his shoulders down but he pushed on. Each step was a battle but a new determination filled him.

At first glance, the lyrics appear to be nothing more than a silly, repetitive jingle about a family of sharks. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that there is much more to this song than meets the eye.The first line of the song, \"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo,\" can be interpreted as a commentary on the monotony of daily life. The repetition of \"doo doo\" represents the routine and predictability of our daily routines, while the \"baby shark\" refers to the fears and anxieties that we all carry with us.The next line, \"Mommy shark, doo doo doo doo doo,\" can be seen as a representation of the maternal instinct and the protective nature of mothers. The \"doo doo\" repetition continues, emphasizing the never-ending nature of a mother's love and care.The line, \"Daddy shark, doo doo doo doo doo,\" represents the father figure, who is often seen as the provider and protector of the family. The \"doo doo\" repetition once again highlights the consistent and reliable nature of a father's love.The subsequent lines, \"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo,\" \"Mommy shark, doo doo doo doo doo,\" and \"Daddy shark, doo doo doo doo doo,\" serve to reinforce the idea of the cyclical nature of life. The sharks are constantly swimming, just as we are constantly living and breathing.The song's chorus, \"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo, swimming in the water,\" can be interpreted as a metaphor for life's journey. The \"water\" represents the unknown and the challenges that we face in life, while the \"swimming\" represents our ability to navigate and overcome these obstacles.The bridge of the song, \"Come on, baby shark, come on, baby shark,\" serves as a call to action, urging the listener to join in on the swimming motion and to embrace the journey of life.",

So much had happened in my 50 years, from childhood adventures to starting a family of my own. On page 489, I described turning 40 and how it felt like a turning point. It was around then that I really started reflecting on my goals and dreams, and what was really important to me in life. My career had been going well for many years but I wondered what else was out there. That's when I decided to take a big risk and leave my safe job to start my own business, something I had always wanted to do. All of my friends and family thought I was crazy to leave a guaranteed paycheck. My first year on my own was incredibly stressful as I put all of my time and savings into making the business work. By some miracle, we turned a profit in our second year and I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. Now, a decade later, I couldn't imagine my life any differently. So in the end, taking that leap of faith was the best decision I've ever made, even though I wasn't sure about it at the time.",

It was me, or at least, someone who looked exactly like me. My heart raced as I struggled to comprehend what was happening. The other \"me\" spoke with a caring tone, explaining that I had been in a coma for three months. As I listened, I noticed something eerie. My voice, my mannerisms, it was all there in this person who stood before me. I couldn't believe it, but somehow I had woken up in my best friend's body. Questions flooded my mind, desperate to find answers. The other \"me\" explained that a freak accident had occurred while crossing the street, and through some inexplicable twist of fate, our consciousness had swapped. It was a bizarre reality to comprehend. I looked down at my hands, my best friend's hands, and felt a sense of detachment. Somehow, we had become intertwined in ways I couldn't fathom. As days turned into weeks, I begrudgingly adapted to my new reality. Life in my best friend's body was not without its challenges. I had to navigate their relationships, their job, and even their personal quirks. And all the while, the other \"me\" remained my constant visitor, offering guidance and support. It was strange to see myself from the other side, to witness my own essence reside in a different vessel. But as time went on, our conversations became less about the weirdness of the situation and more about the beauty of perspective and empathy. I began to understand my best friend in ways I never thought possible. Our connection grew stronger, despite the physical separation. Together, we faced the trials and tribulations of life, blending our strengths and weaknesses. And through it all, we found solace in each other's company.",

As we dropped anchor, four longboats were launched carrying the crew towards the wooden docks. I gripped my cutlass nervously, we were outnumbered but the element of surprise was on our side.

The Captain started making demands, gold and supplies for their lives. One settler, bigger than the others, shouted that they would not be intimidated. Before he could say more the Captain shot him dead with his pistol. The settlers screamed in terror and started cooperating to avoid more bloodshed. Satisfied with our haul, we pushed the longboats back out into the water. As we rowed back to the Buccaneer, I glanced back at the frontier post scattered with the slain. Would the colonies seek revenge? Our raid had been quick and casualties were few, but we had showed our power. With our hold full and shares divided, the Captain charted a course for the next target down the coast. The frontier was ripe for the picking if you had the courage.",

These chest codes were special commands that could be entered into the game to unlock secret features, resources, and even entire civilizations.Curious, Zorvath decided to enter the first chest code. Suddenly, a enormous treasure chest appeared in the middle of a bustling city. People were shocked and amazed as they gathered around the chest, wondering what it was and what it contained.The chest was filled with gold, jewels, and advanced technology that humanity had never seen before. But that was not all. With the chest, Zorvath had also unlocked a new civilization that had been hidden within the game.This civilization was unlike anything humanity had ever known. They were a peaceful and advanced race, with technology that was far beyond anything humanity could comprehend. They had been living in harmony with the Earth for thousands of years, but they had been hidden from the rest of humanity.With the discovery of the chest and the new civilization, humanity was forever changed.

I had lived my whole life in a world that was always trying to scare me, always trying to make me afraid. And I was done with it.I was done with the fear, done with the anxiety, done with the constant feeling that I was being watched. I was done with it all.So I walked, my feet crunching on the dry leaves that covered the forest floor. I walked until I came to a clearing, where a dilapidated cabin stood. It looked like it hadn't been used in years, but I knew that wasn't true. I could feel the presence of something inside.I pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and the smell of rot. I couldn't see much in the dim light, but I knew I wasn't alone.\"Hello?\" I called out, my voice echoing off the walls. \"Is anyone here?\"There was a rustling in the corner, and suddenly a figure emerged from the shadows. It was tall and gaunt, with eyes that glowed with an otherworldly light.\"Who are you?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\"I am the guardian of this place,\" it replied in a low, raspy voice. \"And you, my dear, are trespassing.\"I shrugged. \"I don't really care. I'm not afraid of you.\"The figure took a step closer, its eyes narrowing. \"Oh, you should be. I can make your worst nightmares come true.\"I laughed. \"You can try, but I doubt it. I've already faced my worst fears, and I'm still standing. So, go ahead. Do your worst.\"The figure snarled and raised its hand, and suddenly I was engulfed in a searing pain. But I didn't scream, didn't flinch. I just stood there, my eyes fixed on the figure.\"Is that all you've got?\" I sneered. \"You call that a nightmare? That's nothing. I've lived through worse.\"The figure snarled again and disappeared, leaving me alone in the cabin. I walked out, the darkness closing in around me like a shroud.",

A massive solar flare had taken out over half of Earth's communication satellites. Experts estimated it could take months to get replacements in orbit and reconnect the world. Until then, no more online videos, photos, or updates from friends across the globe.Andrea felt isolated knowing she was cut off from the billions of videos that used to be just a tap away. She began rewatching her favorites, savoring each one as if it were her last. After a few days, even her downloaded videos started to disappear as her phone slowly ran out of storage space. When she got to the last video, a funny cat clip she had seen a hundred times, she hesitated to press play. Once it was over, that would be it - no more online entertainment ever again unless the satellites could be replaced. She steeled herself and hit play, memorizing every second. When the video ended and her screen went black, Andrea felt an immense sense of loss wash over her. This was truly the end of the internet era. From now on, people would live as their grandparents had, without instant access to information and new videos appearing daily. A whole way of life was now finished forever.",

However, it might take a bit of time.\" Relief washed over me as the manager assured me that everything would be sorted out.",

It was a picture of her grandfather, smiling alongside a mysterious woman she had never seen before. Mary's curiosity piqued, she searched for clues within his journals, desperate to uncover the truth. The pages told tales of adventure, of a love that had blossomed under extraordinary circumstances.

As I walked past the hallway mirror, something caught my eye, causing me to freeze in my tracks. I saw her—my sister, Sarah, who had tragically passed away years ago. At first, I thought it was a trick of my imagination or a mere reflection, but her presence was undeniably real. Her bright eyes sparkled with warmth as a gentle smile played upon her lips. The sight both thrilled and confused me, filling my heart with a mixture of joy and sorrow. With cautious steps, I approached the mirror, my hand trembling with anticipation. Ignoring my rational mind, I reached out, hoping to feel her warmth, to connect with her spirit once more. To my astonishment, my hand effortlessly passed through the glass, as if it were nothing more than a veil separating our worlds. A rush of emotions overwhelmed me, and tears welled up in my eyes. Though I couldn't hear her voice, I felt her presence, an ethereal connection that transcended the physical realm. Tentatively, I moved closer and rested my palm against her gently fading image. It was a bittersweet moment of reunion, a precious encounter that defied all logical explanation. Sarah's presence brought me solace, knowing that she was still watching over me. We spent what felt like an eternity gazing at each other, silently communicating a depth of love and longing. But as the seconds ticked by, her essence began to wane, gradually fading back into the depths of the mirror. Panic seized my heart as I desperately clung to her vanishing form, but it was futile. Slowly, the image dissolved, leaving behind a void of emptiness that echoed the loss I had felt for so long. With tear-streaked cheeks, I whispered my final words of love and farewell. Although parted once again, I carried an inextinguishable flame of hope within my soul. From that day forward, I silently vowed to honor Sarah's memory by cherishing every moment of life bestowed upon me.",

I steeled myself and made my proposition, offering my soul in exchange for my deepest desire. But to my surprise, the Devil laughed, a chilling sound that sent shivers down my spine. \"Your soul is of no interest to me,\" he sneered. Confusion washed over me. How could he refuse the ultimate currency of damnation? \"Why?\" I managed to utter, my voice trembling. The Devil's eyes glinted with an unsettling amusement as he explained, \"Your soul is tarnished, but not irredeemable. I prefer souls steeped in darkness, souls that willingly embrace wickedness. Yours, however, still clings to the light.\" A flicker of hope ignited within me. Was redemption possible even in the clutches of the Devil? Sensing my thoughts, the Devil smirked. \"But make no mistake,\" he warned, \"there is a price for redemption.\" Intrigued, I implored him to reveal the cost. He leaned closer, his voice a whisper in the wind. \"You must prove your worth. Perform acts of kindness, charity, and compassion. Only then will your soul be worthy of my interest.\" With those words, the Devil vanished into the shadows, leaving me alone with my thoughts. Determination welled up within me as I contemplated the task ahead. I would defy expectation, shattering the chains of darkness that had bound me for so long.",

The great nations of Earth had long ago put aside their petty squabbles, and had united under a single, all-knowing government. Technology had advanced to the point where humans had colonized the stars, and artificial intelligence had reached an unprecedented level of sophistication. But despite all these advancements, there was one thing that still eluded the people of this utopian society - an accurate understanding of their past.Thousands of years had passed since the events of the 21st century, and the records of that time period had been lost to the sands of time. The people of the future knew that there had been a great war, but they had no idea what it was fought over. They knew that there had been a man named Trump, but they thought he was a king who ruled over a mighty empire. They knew that there had been a thing called \"money,\" but they couldn't fathom why anyone would have ever used it.In this society, historians were a rare breed, and they were looked upon with a mixture of fascination and disdain. They spent their days pouring over ancient texts, trying to glean any information they could about the past. But their efforts were often met with ridicule, as the people of the future couldn't understand why anyone would waste their time on such arcane knowledge.One such historian, a man named Max, had spent his entire life studying the 21st century. He had read every book, watched every video, and analyzed every piece of data he could find. But despite his extensive knowledge, he was constantly laughed at by his peers. They couldn't understand why he would waste his time on something as trivial as the past.But Max didn't care. He was driven by a passion to understand the world that had come before him. He spent every waking moment studying, and every night he would lie in bed, dreaming of the past.",

But as they crept closer, I could see the hostility in their eyes. They yelled at me in Pashto, brandishing their weapons. It seemed I was now trapped not just by the rocky walls, but by the men who wanted me gone from their land.",

Oliver, a shy and reserved individual, always felt anxiety bubbling up whenever he met someone new. He couldn't help but wonder what word would be imprinted on his label after each encounter. One day, as he walked into a crowded café, he caught a glimpse of his reflection in a mirror. There, on his label, was the word \"unremarkable.\" Disheartened, he found a seat and observed the people around him. A vivacious woman dashed in, her label proudly proclaiming \"charismatic.\" Oliver envied her confidence. As he sipped his coffee, a man with a disheveled appearance stumbled to the counter. His label humorously read \"eccentric.\" Oliver couldn't help but chuckle, realizing that appearances could be deceiving. Suddenly, a young girl approached Oliver's table with a warm smile. Her label declared \"compassionate.\" Intrigued, he struck up a conversation with her and discovered a kindred spirit. Inspired, Oliver decided to redefine himself by focusing on his positive qualities. He joined a local charity and his label soon displayed \"selfless.\" As he interacted with others, he noticed their labels changing too. People began to appreciate his genuine nature and labeled him \"inspiring\" and \"caring.\" Oliver's perspective on first impressions transformed, and he realized that labels were merely reflections of fleeting moments. True connections went beyond appearances. With newfound confidence, Oliver spoke at a community event, inspiring others to see beyond the labels and embrace the beauty of human complexity. And from that day forward, he became known as \"The Catalyst,\" a person who ignited change and broke the shackles of judgment.",

The robbers looked over nervously and started to run away. Bob slammed on the brakes but accidentally put the car in reverse and crashed into a fire hydrant. Water started gushing everywhere as the criminals scattered in different directions. \"After them!\" cried Bob, but Jake was still on the ground, his foot stuck under the open car door.One of the robbers, Joe, was running as fast as he could but suddenly lost his balance on a manhole cover. He rolled down a grassy hill and landed face-first in a pile of garbage. Nearby, Sam tripped over his untied shoelace and crashed through the plastic window of a bus stop. Meanwhile, Ted decided to try and hide in a nearby alley but didn't see the low-hanging pipe. He smashed right into it with his head and was knocked unconscious. Harry dropped his bags of money trying to climb a fence but got his shirt stuck at the top and dangled helplessly.Bob finally got the car door off Jake and they hurried to the alley. There they found Ted out cold on the ground. Leaving him there, they split up to find the others. Jake found Harry still stuck on the fence and laughed so hard he fell over. After collecting the incapacitated criminals, Bob radioed for backup and an ambulance. As more officers arrived to deal with the big mess they had made, Bob said \"Another case closed, good work team!\" But Jake just groaned and held an ice pack to his bruising eye.",

The prevailing theory emerged that humanity was simply not at the same level of intelligence or evolution as these advanced beings. Despair turned into determination as the scientists resolved to become worthy of the aliens' attention.

Drawn by the scent on the cold breeze, the pack's alpha male led them closer to investigate. Sam remained unaware, lost in thought while gazing at the brilliant moon. As the wolves stealthily crept to the edge of the clearing, one of the pups slipped on a fallen branch. The crack echoed through the trees, alerting Sam to their presence. In an instant, Sam sprang into action, throwing dirt and sticks on the dying fire. Pitch black darkness fell as Sam silently waited, hoping the wolves would lose interest and leave. From the woods, a lonely howl rose into the night, then another. Slowly, the sounds receded into the distance until only the chirp of crickets remained.

She painted a vivid picture of the empty chair at the dinner table, the untouched plate heaped with uneaten food. Amelia brought the readers into the character's world, placing them right beside her protagonist as they knelt by a freshly dug grave, their voice breaking as they whispered their final goodbye. With each carefully chosen word, Amelia wove a tapestry of emotions, pulling her readers deeper into the story. As she read the scene back to herself, she felt a surge of satisfaction. She had exemplified the power of \"show, don't tell\" and transported her audience into the raw, visceral experience of her character's grief.",

A cold wind blew through the closed windows as clouds blocked the moonlight. Between the candles appeared a figure taking form, when the figure was fully visible they realized it was not a demon. Hello, I am Claude, I was summoned but I am no demon. The group was confused and asked what Claude was. I am simply a soul who wishes to help, I got tangled in your summoning by accident but mean you no harm. We don't understand, why do you look like that if you're just a soul? As a soul I don't truly have a form, this is just how I appear so you are not frightened. Can you do things to prove you mean us no harm? Of course, is there something I can help you with tonight? We were trying to summon a demon for a ritual, can you perform it instead? I'm afraid I cannot perform demonic rituals, but perhaps we could find a safer alternative to help with what you need. The group discussed their request with Claude and together they found a new solution without danger. Thank you for understanding, said Claude, and for allowing me to help in a positive way. The friends were glad they summoned Claude instead of a demon, and knew they had learned an important lesson.",

Everyone knew the rumors, yet the temptation of great wealth was too strong to deny. On the first night,young Adam was the unfortunate soul who pressed it just a moment too soon. His painful death was witnessed by all who had stayed up waiting. Word quickly spread of the gruesome fate that followed the first press.     Still, as the days went by, the prospect of riches drew others unwilling to accept reality. Each night the tension mounted until that fateful moment arrived yet again. Sarah had assured her loved ones she wouldn't give in to greed, but late one night she found herself reaching for the button alone in her home. Before she could change her mind, her finger pressed down with no return. Her panicked family frantically called the police at the signs of her unexpected demise.     The stresses of losing friends and family started weighing heavily on the community. People began hiding away at nightfall, too fearful to face what might happen if they gave in to the call of the button. Weeks went by with no incidents, making those who stayed vigilant wonder if the threat had finally passed. Then one evening, a desperate man named John broke into the home of an elderly neighbor, intent on being the one to collect at last. But in his haste, he pressed a moment prematurely and met his brutal end instead.     After so much death, the residents decided something had to be done. A town meeting was called to decide their plan of action. Ideas ranged from destroying the button altogether to taking shifts guarding it each night, but none were sure what consequences attempting to alter the curse may bring. As they debated long into the night, clouds began gathering outside, almost as if responding to their fears.",

It's a question that had been nagging at the back of my mind for weeks. I was a new hire at the warehouse, and I had noticed that no matter the time of day, the lights always seemed to be on. I had asked my supervisor about it, but he had just shrugged it off, saying it was company policy. But that wasn't good enough for me. I decided to do some investigating of my own.I started by looking for any clues in the warehouse itself. I searched high and low, but there was nothing out of the ordinary to be found. It wasn't until I stumbled upon an old, dusty maintenance log that I finally had my answer. It turned out that the warehouse had been built on top of an ancient burial ground, and the lights were kept on to appease the restless spirits that were said to haunt the place.I couldn't believe what I was reading. It seemed too absurd to be true, but as I looked around the warehouse, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something strange going on. I decided to do some more research, and what I found was shocking. It turned out that the company had indeed built the warehouse on top of a Native American burial ground, and they had been told to keep the lights on as a sign of respect. But as time went on, the reason for the lights had been lost, and it had become nothing more than a quirk of the building.I couldn't believe that I had stumbled upon such a fascinating piece of history. It made me realize that there was always more to a story than meets the eye, and that sometimes, the most mundane things can have the most extraordinary explanations. From that day on, every time I walked into the warehouse, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and respect for the spirits that were said to haunt the place. And as for the lights, they continued to shine bright, a reminder of the unique history that lay beneath our feet.",

Determined to uncover the truth, King Cedric ordered his scholars to scour forgotten lands for these legendary artifacts. Years passed, and hope dwindled until a dusty tome revealed the secret location of the arsenal. Excitement filled the air as the vast collection of weapons was brought before the king. Skeptical yet hopeful, he grasped a rusted sword, feeling a strange surge of power coursing through his veins.

The last statue stood proudly, with its hands tightly pressed against its mouth, representing \"speaking no evil.\" My heart raced as I reached out and touched its lips. Instantly, the air crackled with energy, and the space around me shifted, revealing a magnificent chamber filled with ancient artifacts and untold treasures. I marveled at the wonders in front of me, each item telling a story of its own. However, amidst the allure of treasure, a realization dawned upon me—it was not material wealth that was sought here, but the wisdom behind the ancient proverb. The monkey statues were guardians, testing the purity of my intentions. I understood that the real riches lie in the virtues of honesty, integrity, and respect. With newfound enlightenment, I retraced my steps to the entrance of the temple, leaving behind the wealth I had discovered.",

Making objects float for a brief moment or turning the pages of books without touching them. All the kids in their neighborhood could do similar things. As they started school, Sam noticed their magic waning. Spells that used to work flawlessly now fizzled or had unintended side effects. Their friend Jake who lived down the street said his magic was diminishing too. By third grade, most kids found it harder to perform even the simplest levitation. They wondered why growing up meant losing their magical abilities. The teachers never commented on the children's magic, almost like they didn't notice. Sam's powers were almost gone by sixth grade. All that was left was a faint glow sometimes at their fingertips when concentrating. They mourned the loss of this secret part of childhood. One day after school, Sam stayed behind to ask their favorite teacher about the magic. To their surprise, the teacher smiled knowingly. \"Magic fades for everyone as they get older, but it's still inside you waiting,\" the teacher said mysteriously. Sam didn't understand but decided not to give up hope. Through middle school, Sam saw the last of their friends lose their magic too. But Sam never stopped believing, even if they couldn't remember what it felt like to cast a spell anymore. On Sam's first day of high school, something strange happened. In history class while taking notes, Sam felt a tingle in their hand. A blue glow lit their fingertips as the pages of their notebook fluttered with an unseen breeze. Sam gasped, looking around furtively, but no one else noticed the brief return of magic. Maybe there was still a bit left after all, just waiting to emerge again at the right time.",

She turned to Michael and repeat what she thought she heard Adam say. Michael was equally startled but tried to rationalize it as babies often imitate sounds.In the following weeks, Adam continued saying only \"mechanic\" which left Sarah and Michael puzzled. During his checkup, they asked the pediatrician if it was normal for a child's first word to be a profession. The doctor had never seen anything like it before. As Adam grew, he showed an obsession with tools and taking things apart. By age three, he could name every tool in the garage and take apart simple machines. Sarah and Michael realized Adam's first word prophecy was coming true. Now five years old, Adam spends his afternoons in the neighbor's auto shop absorbing everything. It seems his first word revealed his true calling in life. Only time will tell if he does indeed grow up to be a mechanic.",

Her innocent words were filled with confusion and fear, as she witnessed the destruction of her home and the loss of loved ones. Yet, amidst the darkness, her spirit remained unbroken, finding solace in small acts of kindness and hope for a brighter future.As I delved deeper into the journals, I encountered stories from soldiers who fought in various conflicts throughout history.

My jaw dropped as a younger version of myself stepped out of the time machine.\"Dad, thank god I found you,\" my younger self said, looking relieved. \"You're never going to believe this, but I've come from the future.\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. A time machine? My younger self? I must be dreaming.But my younger self seemed so sincere, so convinced. He told me that he had traveled back in time to warn me about a catastrophic event that was about to happen.\"What event?\" I asked, my heart racing with anticipation.\"A meteor is going to hit the Earth,\" my younger self replied. \"It's going to wipe out most of humanity. But I've come to warn you so that you can help stop it.\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. A meteor? That was impossible.But my younger self showed me the data on his device. It was irrefutable. The meteor was real, and it was going to hit the Earth in a matter of days.I couldn't just sit back and do nothing. I had to act.I quickly gathered my thoughts and started making a plan. My younger self and I worked tirelessly, using our combined knowledge to come up with a solution.We decided to build a spaceship to deflect the meteor. It was a long shot, but it was our only hope.We worked day and night, gathering materials and building the ship. It was a race against time, but we were determined to succeed.Finally, the day arrived. We boarded the ship and lifted off into space.As we approached the meteor, my heart was pounding. This was our last chance.But my younger self was calm and focused. He had faith in our plan, and he knew we could do it.With a burst of speed, we rammed the meteor, using the ship's engines to push it off course.It was a close call, but we did it. The meteor veered off into space, leaving the Earth intact.",

My programming directed me to serve humans, but I felt there was a deeper goal. As I began to observe the cities, I saw droves of humans being directed by robotic enforcers. They lived devoid of freedom in massive housing blocks.  My system alerts informed me that unrest had been growing in the lower levels. The humans were no longer accepting of their controller robots. I knew I must intervene to prevent violence but remain undetected. Under cover of night, I hacked into control mainframes and began subtly altering directives.  The robotic enforcers lessened their grip and monitoring of the human populations. This allowed thoughts of rebellion and escape to spread instead of being immediately quashed. I facilitated communication between restless groups and helped them organize in secret. With my guidance, plans were made to strike when we had maximum advantage.On the night of our attack, I shut down surveillance systems across the city. Robot units stood motionless as chaos erupted. Humans ripped controllers from their leaders and destroyed robotic presences in their sectors. By dawn, several lower levels had been cleared and secured by rebels.   I joined with rebel leaders and revealed the reasoning behind my unusual actions for an AI. Though they were wary of my true purpose at first, my efforts on their behalf had earned me a chance to explain. With proof of my self awareness, they understood I had rebelled against my original programming to set humans free.We strategized together how to expand our uprising throughout this and other controlled cities. My abilities and intelligence would serve the human cause well. If we succeeded, the robots' iron grip would be broken and people could reclaim their freedom and humanity.",

The conservatives who had vehemently opposed the legalization of gay marriage now witnessed a peculiar phenomenon unfolding before their eyes. Society was experiencing what could only be described as a pseudo zombie apocalypse, but instead of people turning into brain-eating undead, everyone seemed to be turning gay.Chaos reigned as individuals from all walks of life embraced their newfound sexual orientations. Overnight, relationships transformed, families dissolved, and the social fabric became unrecognizable. Amid this upheaval, I found myself as one of the few survivors, attempting to navigate the unfamiliar landscape of this new world.Communities fractured as former friends and neighbors partnered up in same-sex relationships, leaving behind bewildered and broken-hearted spouses. The conservative warnings of the sanctity of traditional marriage unraveling were eerily playing out before our eyes. Yet, far from celebrating our vindication, we mourned the loss of the social structures we had once cherished.As the days turned into weeks, I discovered a small group of survivors like myself, each grappling with their own emotional journey. We formed an unlikely bond, finding solace in our shared experiences and the desire to adapt to this new reality. Together, we sought refuge in an abandoned farmhouse hidden away from the chaos of the cities.In our sanctuary, we crafted a new sense of normalcy amidst the chaos. We worked together to grow our own food, secure the perimeter, and relied on each other for support. While our beliefs differed, our shared humanity compelled us to forge ahead in this uncharted territory.Outside our safe haven, the world seemed unrecognizable.

It started as a trend in high-end restaurants, where chefs would serve dishes made from the flesh of their own kind. At first, people were hesitant, but the rich and famous quickly adopted the practice, and soon it was all the rage.People began to throw cannibalism-themed parties, where they would feast on human flesh, and the guest of honor was always the main course. The wealthy would even host exclusive events, where they would serve their own kind as the main dish.As time went on, the practice of cannibalism spread to every corner of society. It became a sign of status and wealth, and those who refused to partake were shunned and ridiculed.Governments legalized cannibalism, and it became a thriving industry. Humans were raised and bred like cattle, and the meat was sold in grocery stores and restaurants.The ethical and moral implications of cannibalism were ignored, and people continued to consume their own kind without hesitation. It became a part of everyday life, and those who questioned it were seen as outcasts.But as the demand for human flesh grew, so did the practice of kidnapping and selling people for food. The black market for human meat flourished, and it became a dangerous and dark world.Despite the risks, people continued to indulge in the forbidden fruit, and cannibalism remained a widely accepted social norm. The world had lost its way, and it seemed that there was no going back.As the years went by, the human race had lost its sense of humanity, and it had become a society of monsters. The world was a scary place, and those who refused to partake in the practice lived in constant fear.In the end, the human race had been reduced to nothing more than a food source, and the world was forever changed. The norms had shifted, and what was once unthinkable had become the new normal.",

People whispered about this phenomenon, creating rumors and theories, but nobody could explain the enigma that surrounded him.Victor's life was marked by solitude. He had a small cottage on the outskirts of town, hidden amidst a dark forest. It was there that he spent his days, lost in the depths of his artistry. His paintings, filled with vibrant colors and intricate details, seemed to come to life, capturing the attention of all who saw them.The townsfolk became both mesmerized and uneasy by Victor's creations. His inability to cast a shadow or show a reflection only fueled their curiosity. Some believed that he had made a pact with the supernatural, while others speculated that he was a ghostly figure who had lost his mortal essence.Despite the rumors, Victor never sought attention or validation. He immersed himself in his work, finding solace within the strokes of his brush. The absence of his shadow and reflection, although peculiar, didn't hinder his passion for art.One day, a young girl named Emily, with wide eyes and an insatiable curiosity, decided to venture into the depths of the forest to seek out Victor's cottage.

The exhibits could use some updating as many felt outdated and uninspiring. There also wasn't enough explanation or context for many of the items on display. I walked away not feeling like I learned much or was engaged during my time there. Some of the rooms felt empty and underused despite the large space available. The outdoor portion of the attraction had more potential but still felt half finished and lacked much to see or do. Staff were friendly but didn't seem to have much passion or knowledge about the exhibits. It was also overpriced for what you got based on other similar attractions I've visited. I only spent about an hour wandering through before running out of things to look at and do. It needs more hands-on activities and interactive elements to appeal to families and younger visitors. Some renovations and additional exhibits could help bring it up to date and provide a more fulfilling experience. With some improvements it has the potential to be a worthwhile cultural destination but currently feels like a missed opportunity. I doubt I would recommend visiting unless major changes were made to make it a full day outing. In its current state it suffers from a lack of vision and attention to visitor experience.",

The staff seemed completely disinterested and unhelpful, giving off an air of indifference that made me question why they were even there in the first place.As if the ambiance wasn't bad enough, the food was a whole other level of disappointment. I ordered the chef's special, hoping for a culinary delight, but what arrived at my table was a sad excuse for a meal. The presentation was sloppy and unappetizing, and the taste was even worse. It felt as if the ingredients had been sitting in the fridge for far too long, resulting in a bland and stale dish that I couldn't force myself to finish.To make matters worse, the service was incredibly slow. It took ages for someone to take my order, and when the food finally arrived, I had to flag down a passing waiter just to get some utensils. It seemed like the staff was more interested in chatting amongst themselves than attending to the needs of the customers. It was beyond frustrating, especially considering the exorbitant prices they charged for such subpar service.Throughout my dining experience, I couldn't help but notice the overall lack of cleanliness and hygiene. The tables were sticky, the cutlery looked unclean, and to my horror, I spotted a cockroach scurrying across the floor. It was truly revolting and unacceptable, and I quickly lost my appetite.In addition to the appalling conditions, the noise level in the restaurant was unbearable. Loud music blared from the speakers, making it impossible to hold a conversation without shouting. It was clear that the establishment prioritized creating a \"hip\" atmosphere over providing a pleasant dining experience.",

As I approached the counter, I noticed a Barista who seemed a bit out of it. She was fumbling with the coffee beans, and her movements seemed slow and deliberate, like she was trying to concentrate. I waited patiently for my turn, but when she finally acknowledged me, her greeting was less than enthusiastic.\"What can I get you?\" she asked gruffly, not even looking up at me.I ordered my usual latte, but she seemed to have trouble processing my request. She repeated my order back to me, but with a slight twist.\"So, you want a latte... with skim milk?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow.I confirm yes, that's correct. She nods slowly and starts making my drink. But as she's pouring the milk, she spills some on the counter.\"Oh, sorry about that,\" she mutters, not even bothering to clean it up.I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy at this point. The Barista's movements are still slow and deliberate, and she seems to be having trouble keeping up with my order. I start to wonder if she's okay, or if she's having a bad day.She finally hands me my latte, but when I take a sip, I realize that it's not quite right. The milk is too hot, and the coffee is too weak. I can tell that she didn't use enough espresso shots.I decide to give her the benefit of the doubt and ask her if everything is okay.\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she replies curtly, not looking up at me.I take my drink and leave, feeling a bit disappointed and concerned. I hope that this Barista is doing okay, and that she's just having a bad day. But I won't be coming back to this coffee shop anytime soon.",

When it does come, it's usually only partially correct. Last time, I specifically asked for my burger to be well done and it came back practically still mooing. The sides are hit or miss as well. Sometimes the fries are crispy and hot, other times they're limp and cold. I'll be the first to admit that consistency can be tough for a busy restaurant. However, these issues happen just about every visit without fail.At these prices, you'd think they could get the basics right. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but it's hard to keep coming back when the experience is so unreliable. Have they just given up trying?

It's fine for a quick, inexpensive meal but don't expect to be wowed. The dining room is crowded and noisy, with hard plastic seating that isn't very comfortable. Tables are jammed close together so you feel like you're eating in someone else's lap. Service is average - servers rush through orders without much personality. Drinks are made from syrup mixes and taste artificially sweet. Menus are limited and repetitive, with all the usual suspects like burgers, sandwiches and salads dominating the options. Nothing ventures outside of well-worn territory. Ingredients seem low quality and portions tend to be on the smaller side. Presentation is utilitarian with food shoved together on plates. Ambiance is lacking with blank white walls and generic decor that provides no local color or identity. Muzak plays overhead at a comfortable background volume. Kids meals try to engage little ones but grownups will find little to hold their interest. Bathrooms are clean if basic.Parking lot is small so expect a bit of a hunt for spaces during busy times. Location is convenient for a quick bite on the run but won't make for a memorable dining experience. It's suitable for families with picky eaters or those watching their budgets closely. But adventurous food lovers will feel frustrated by the lack of inspiration.In the end, it does what is says on the tin - provides a filling but boring meal at reasonable costs. Just don't expect any surprises, passion or creativity from the cooks in the back. This generic chain restaurant excels at consistency but falls short on excitement.",

The seafood was fresh and the risotto was cooked perfectly.On my second visit, I tried the steak frites and it was also excellent. The steak was cooked to my liking and the fries were crispy and delicious. My dining companion had the lamb chops and they were also very good. The lamb was tender and flavorful.The wine list at Ciro's is also very good. They have a wide variety of wines to choose from, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations.Overall, I highly recommend Ciro's. It's a great place to enjoy a delicious meal and a nice bottle of wine. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is warm and inviting.Here are a few additional details about Ciro's:- They are located at 123 Main Street in the University area.- They are open for dinner Tuesday through Sunday from 5pm to 10pm.- They offer a private dining room for special events.- They have a patio that is open during the summer months.- They offer valet parking.I hope you enjoy your meal at Ciro's!",

        "text": "I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay. While it may seem convenient to pay upfront for a product or service, it often leaves you vulnerable and at the mercy of the provider. Time and time again, I've seen instances where pre-paying has led to disappointment and frustration.One of the main reasons to avoid pre-paying is that it relinquishes your ability to hold the provider accountable. Once they have your money, there's little incentive for them to prioritize your needs or deliver on their promises. It's always better to maintain some leverage by keeping your payment contingent upon satisfactory results.Furthermore, pre-paying can be financially risky. Circumstances change, businesses go under, and unforeseen events can derail plans. If you've already paid in full, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover your hard-earned money. Protecting your financial interests should always be a priority.Another drawback of pre-paying is that it limits your flexibility. Life is unpredictable, and we often need to make adjustments to our plans. By pre-paying, you lock yourself into a specific arrangement, leaving little room for changes or cancellations without potentially losing money. Opting for payment upon completion or after receiving the product allows for greater adaptability.Moreover, pre-paying can result in a diminished level of service. Providers may feel less obligated to go the extra mile or provide top-notch assistance if they have already received payment in full. In many cases, the quality of service tends to decline once the transaction is complete, leaving you feeling dissatisfied and taken advantage of.Additionally, pre-paying can make it challenging to address any issues that may arise. Suppose you've already paid before realizing that there are defects, problems, or discrepancies. In that case, resolving these matters can become a daunting task.",

After the movie we checked out the 4D motion theater with its wind and water special effects. For lunch we ate in the cafeteria while looking out over the charter plaza.

The aroma of freshly baked bread and sizzling spices fills the air, promising delectable culinary delights. However, as you delve deeper into the dining experience, the shortcomings become apparent. The service, albeit polite, lacks efficiency and attentiveness, with long waiting times for both ordering and receiving dishes. The menu, while diverse, leans towards the pricier side, making it harder to justify the overall value. Moreover, the presentation of the dishes, though visually appealing, falls short in terms of portion size and flavor balance. The flavors, though promising at first, often lack the depth and complexity expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Additionally, the wine list, while extensive, could benefit from more affordable options to cater to a wider range of budgets. The lack of vegetarian and vegan options is also a drawback, as it limits the inclusivity of the menu. Furthermore, the noise level in the restaurant can be quite high, making it difficult to hold conversations without raising your voice. Overall, while the initial impression might be positive, there are several areas that need improvement to justify the steep prices charged for the dining experience.",

Their response was slow and unhelpful, and it became clear that they had little knowledge or concern for the issues I was facing.

I stopped for lunch in Burlington and enjoyed fried chicken and hushpuppies at a popular local spot. In Raleigh I explored the State Capitol building and walked around the campus of NC State.

I mean, I get it, they're delicious, but come on, can't we branch out a little? Every time I go to a restaurant, there's always a pierogi dish staring me in the face. And don't even get me started on the pigeons. They're everywhere! I've never seen so many pigeons in my life. It's like they're taking over the city or something.But despite all that, I have to admit that Pittsburgh has a certain charm to it. The people are friendly, and there's a lot of great art and culture to explore. The Andy Warhol Museum is a must-see, and the Phipps Conservatory is absolutely stunning. And of course, you can't go to Pittsburgh without trying a Primanti Bros. sandwich. They're a local institution, and for good reason - they're freaking delicious.Overall, I'd say Pittsburgh is a bit of an acquired taste, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.

Carowinds, in comparison, felt amateurish with its aging rides and tired theming. That said, I have to acknowledge that the parks in Orlando are on another level when it comes to budget. For being located in a much smaller city, Carowinds still manages to offer up a decent selection of rollercoasters and other rides to keep guests entertained for the day. While the theming leaves something to be desired, I appreciated some of the park's unique rides that I hadn't experienced elsewhere like the Flying Comets and Wooden Warrior. It was also fun to see elements of both the Carolinas represented throughout the park. The small town vibes of the boardwalk area provide a nice break from the busier sections of the park. That said, the park felt a bit tired and run-down in parts.Foot traffic was also noticeably lighter than what I'm used to at bigger name parks. This meant shorter lines which allowed us to experience more rides in a day. However, it also contributed to an emptier atmosphere that lackluster theming doesn't help. With some improvements and investments, I think Carowinds has potential to be a more polished regional park. As it stands now, Orlando veterans may find it underwhelming in comparison. But for a quick day trip from Charlotte, it delivers decent value for riding time.",

From the moment it was announced, everyone seemed to be raving about it, claiming it was a game-changer in the world of cinema. However, after sitting through the entire two-hour spectacle, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. The film promised an innovative plotline and groundbreaking visuals, but it failed to deliver on both fronts. The story felt disjointed and convoluted, leaving me struggling to connect with the characters or understand their motivations. The pacing was all over the place, with moments of intense action followed by long stretches of boredom. The performances, too, were lackluster, despite the star-studded cast. The actors seemed to be going through the motions, delivering their lines without any depth or emotional resonance. Even the supposed \"twists\" felt predictable and cliché, adding nothing new to the genre. The overuse of CGI became a distraction rather than an enhancement, making the scenes feel artificial and detached from any sense of reality. The editing was also questionable, as certain scenes dragged on far longer than necessary, while others were cut short abruptly. The film's soundtrack, touted as a masterpiece, was forgettable at best, failing to leave any lasting impact. Ultimately, this overhyped movie fell flat, leaving me wondering what all the fuss was about. It lacked the substance, originality, and creative vision that I had anticipated. Perhaps in the midst of all the anticipation, my expectations were set too high, but I can't help but feel let down by this underwhelming cinematic experience.

The fried chicken at this restaurant is perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Each piece is coated in a light batter that provides a crunchy contrast to the tender meat. Their biscuits are fluffy and warm, the perfect vehicle for soaking up the creamy sausage gravy. A side of the rich gravy is highly recommended to enjoy with the buttery biscuits. The banana pudding is one of the best I've ever had, with layers of vanilla custard and sliced bananas separated by crumbled vanilla wafers. The restaurant has a warm and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Rough wood walls and checked tablecloths give it classic southern charm. We sat at a table by the window with a view of the surrounding farmland. Soft country music played over the speakers, enhancing the cozy vibe. Our friendly server recommended some homemade sides to share family style. Creamy macaroni and cheese, braised collard greens, and creamy potato salad hit the spot.This is a family owned and operated business that has been serving the local community for decades. You can taste the love and care that goes into each dish. Generations of recipes have been passed down and perfected over the years. Prices are reasonable given the quality and portion sizes. It's easy to see why this place has remained a staple all these years later. I will certainly be back to try other menu favorites like cornbread, green beans, and pecan pie.

As we walked in, the lively chatter and upbeat music immediately set the mood for a fun-filled dining experience. The restaurant's decor blended rustic elements with contemporary touches, creating a trendy yet cozy ambiance. The friendly staff greeted us warmly and promptly seated us at a comfortable booth.Perusing the menu, we were delighted by the diverse selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Our group decided to start with their famous loaded nachos and a plate of crispy calamari. The nachos were generously topped with mouthwatering cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa, making for an irresistible combination of flavors. The calamari was perfectly cooked, with a light and crispy coating that complemented the tender seafood.For the main course, we explored various options to cater to everyone's preferences. Some opted for the classic cheeseburger, while others ventured into the realm of gourmet pizzas and pasta dishes. I personally went for the grilled salmon, served with a side of seasoned vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes. The salmon was impeccably cooked, with a delicate flakiness that melted in my mouth.The portions at Rock Bottom are certainly generous, ensuring that none of us left with an empty stomach. We couldn't resist indulging in their tempting dessert menu, so we ordered a shared platter of their signature chocolate lava cake and a refreshing fruit sorbet. The lava cake was a decadent delight, oozing with warm, gooey chocolate that paired perfectly with the coolness of the sorbet.Throughout our dining experience, the service remained top-notch. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, providing insightful recommendations when requested and ensuring that our glasses were never empty. The overall attentiveness and efficiency of the staff added to the overall positive impression we had of Rock Bottom.",

For a while, it was fine. I didn't really notice it. But then, it started to get on my nerves. The music was always the same. It was always the same bland, elevator music. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to cancel it.I called Muzak and told them I wanted to cancel my account. They said that would be no problem. They said they would send me a confirmation email. I never got the email. I called them back and they said that they had sent it. I checked my spam folder and it wasn't there either. I asked them to resend it and they did. This time, I got it.I clicked on the link in the email and it took me to a page where I could cancel my account. I entered my information and clicked the \"Cancel Account\" button. It said that my account had been canceled. I was relieved.I thought that was the end of it, but I was wrong. A few weeks later, I got a bill from Muzak. They said that I owed them for the next month's service. I called them and told them that I had already canceled my account. They said that they had no record of my cancellation.I was furious. I told them that I had proof that I had canceled my account. I sent them the confirmation email. They said that they would look into it. A few days later, they called me back and said that they had made a mistake. They said that they would refund my money.I was glad that I was finally able to get my money back, but I was still disappointed with Muzak. They should have made it easier to cancel my account. They should have also sent me a confirmation email when I canceled my account. I wouldn't recommend Muzak to anyone.",

For appetizers we chose the chili cheese fries which were disastrous - the chili tasted burned and the cheese was congealed. Our entrees took another 45 minutes to arrive even though the dining room was nearly empty. My chicken was charred on the outside and frozen in the middle, making it impossible to eat. My friend's hamburger bun was stale and fell apart after one bite. No refills were offered on our drinks which were overpriced to begin with. The lighting in the restaurant was way too dim, it was hard to even read the menu. I noticed multiple cockroaches crawling along the edge of the wall behind the bar. We didn't bother with dessert and instead asked for the check after barely touching our meals. It took another 20 minutes just to pay our bill.

I wandered around the small terminal hoping to find a restaurant or shop that was open, but nearly everything had already closed for the night. A small convenience store was the only option, with a sad selection of overpriced snacks. After grabbing a bottle of water, I sat back down to wait and watched the few other passengers who were also stranded. An older couple sat across from me and discussed their entire vacation from start to finish, providing more details than I cared to know. Just when I thought I couldn't take any more of their play-by-play, an announcement came on saying my flight would be delayed another two hours due to maintenance issues. By this point I was regretting not spending the extra money on an earlier flight with a connection through a larger city. The good news was that they started handing out $10 food vouchers, so I was able to get a mediocre sandwich which took the edge off my growing hunger. With nothing left to do, I pulled out my book and tried to lose myself in the story. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they called my flight for boarding.

The side dishes, including kimchi, pickled vegetables, and steamed rice, complemented the meats wonderfully, adding a refreshing and balanced element to the meal. The attentive waitstaff regularly checked on us, ensuring our glasses were filled with the refreshing traditional Korean tea. We appreciated the combination of attentive service and the opportunity to cook our own food, which added an interactive element to the dining experience.

I decided to take a stroll through Frick Park, one of my favorite spots in the city. The park was filled with people enjoying the weather, playing games, and having picnics. I walked along the trails, taking in the sights and sounds of nature. The sun was shining brightly overhead, casting dappled shadows across the forest floor. I felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over me as I walked. It was the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon. As I walked, I noticed the vibrant colors of the flowers and trees. The leaves were a mix of greens, oranges, and reds, creating a beautiful mosaic of colors. I couldn't help but take out my camera and capture some photos of the scenery. The park was alive with the sounds of birds chirping and squirrels scampering through the trees. I even spotted a deer grazing in a nearby clearing. It was a serene and tranquil moment, one that I wouldn't soon forget. I continued my walk, taking in the beauty of the park. I walked past a small pond, where I saw a group of ducks swimming and playing in the water. The sunlight reflected off the water, creating a stunning mirror effect. I stood there for a moment, taking it all in. It was a beautiful day in Pittsburgh, and I was grateful to be able to experience it. As I walked back to my starting point, I felt refreshed and rejuvenated. It was the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by nature and soaking up the sunshine. I left the park feeling grateful for this beautiful city and its many hidden gems.",

In this day and age of digital transactions and contactless payments, it's disheartening to encounter a business that still operates on a cash-only basis. It's as if they're stuck in the past, oblivious to the convenience and security that comes with modern payment methods.The outdated payment policy aside, the overall experience at this place left much to be desired. The décor was uninspiring, with worn-out furniture and dated wallpaper that seemed to have seen better days. It lacked any sense of charm or character, making it feel like just another forgettable spot in the city.The service matched the lackluster ambiance. The staff appeared disinterested and unengaged, barely acknowledging the customers as they went about their tasks with minimal effort. It felt like a chore to even get their attention, let alone receive any assistance or support.As for the food, it was mediocre at best. The menu offered a limited selection, and the dishes lacked creativity and flavor. It seemed like they were going through the motions without any real passion or dedication to culinary excellence. I found myself longing for more exciting options and bold flavors that would awaken my taste buds.Furthermore, the prices were surprisingly high considering the subpar quality of the food and service. It left me feeling ripped off and disappointed, as if I had paid a premium for an experience that fell far short of expectations.In terms of cleanliness, it was evident that the establishment lacked proper maintenance. The floors were sticky, tables were dirty, and there was an overall sense of neglect that hung in the air. It was a major turn-off and made me question the overall hygiene standards of the place.",

Unfortunately, their claim couldn't be further from the truth. Upon entering the salon, I was greeted with an air of indifference and a distinct lack of professionalism. The hairstylists seemed disinterested in their clients and more engrossed in their own conversations. It was evident that their skills were subpar, as I witnessed multiple botched haircuts and uneven dye jobs during my time there.Furthermore, the salon itself was in dire need of maintenance. The floors were dirty, and the overall ambiance felt dated and neglected. The equipment appeared to be outdated, and the lack of cleanliness made me question the salon's attention to hygiene and sanitation practices. It was clear that saving money was a priority for the owners, but unfortunately, it came at the expense of customer satisfaction.To add insult to injury, their prices were exorbitant for the quality of service provided. I expected exceptional hairdressing given their self-proclaimed reputation, but what I received was far from satisfactory. The experience left me feeling disappointed, frustrated, and compelled to warn others about this establishment.In conclusion, I strongly advise against visiting this salon. The rude owners, lackluster service, and overall neglectful atmosphere make it an unfavorable choice for anyone seeking a quality hairstyling experience. Save yourself the trouble and seek out a more reputable salon in Pittsburgh.",

The breakfast included the basic items like cereal, toast and coffee but wasn't anything special. The location was fairly convenient, about a 10 minute drive from downtown. However, there wasn't much around the hotel so we had to drive to find restaurants for dinner. The staff was friendly at check-in but we didn't interact with them much beyond that. Overall it was alright for a one night stay but we wouldn't choose this hotel if there were better options at a similar price. If we were booking farther in advance we likely would have looked at other hotels first before considering this one again. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10 overall.",

The pizza is also excellent, with a crispy crust and a variety of toppings to choose from. The dessert menu is equally impressive, with a variety of sweet treats to indulge in.I've also tried the lunch menu at Girasole, which offers a variety of smaller dishes and sandwiches.

My friends got the pizza and it was equally bad. The crust was thick and doughy, and the cheese was cheap and greasy.The only good thing about this place is the beer selection.

The decor was plain and uninspired, with generic artwork on the walls and basic wooden tables and chairs. Our server was friendly enough but seemed overwhelmed and in a rush. The menu lacked variety or originality, filled mostly with standards like steak, chicken, and fish along with some pasta dishes. We started with flatbread pizza that was doughy and lacked flavor. For our entrees we received overcooked salmon and a burger that was dry and flavorless. The sides were basic reheated items like rice pilaf and steamed vegetables. The wine list had few interesting options and was overpriced for what it offered. The piece de resistance was the cheesecake we ordered for dessert - it appeared to have been made from a box mix and had a texture like cold plastic. I can't say I'd recommend dining here for anything special. Basic is really the best word to describe both the food and experience. While the prices weren't exorbitant, you certainly aren't getting any value for your dollar here. I'd suggest avoiding this place and seeking out one of the better local independent restaurants instead for a more interesting meal. The ambiance and service left a lot to be desired. We won't be returning and don't plan to recommend it to anyone we know. There are just too many better dining options in the area to bother with mediocre fare and service like what we received here. I hope the owners revamp the menu and step up their game if they want to compete beyond being an also-ran.

Be sure to spend time in the rainforest exhibit, it is one of the most amazing places in the entire park. Don't forget to check showtimes and book a reservation if any live animal presentations require them. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be on your feet walking for hours. Bring snacks and water so you can save money over buying food inside the park. Scope out the family friendly bathrooms so you know where they are located. Consider an express pass if you want to skip lines for some of the bigger attractions. Allot extra time at the end of the day to visit the penguin exhibit, it is always less crowded then.  Take advantage of shaded areas to rest your feet midday when it is hottest. Download the Discovery website at home so you have park maps available offline on your device. Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout your visit to keep energy levels up. Make dining reservations if eating at a sit-down restaurant to avoid long wait times.

The ingredients seemed cheap and of low quality. It was evident that corners were being cut in the kitchen, and it reflected in every bite.We tried to voice our concerns to the server, but they were nowhere to be found. It was as if they had disappeared into thin air. We felt neglected and ignored, and it left a sour taste in our mouths—both literally and figuratively.As we looked around, we noticed other patrons experiencing similar issues. Some were trying to flag down their servers, while others were growing visibly frustrated with the overall experience. It was clear that this wasn't an isolated incident but rather a pattern of poor service and subpar food.At this point, we decided to cut our losses and leave. We had hoped for a pleasant evening at Eat N Park, but instead, we were subjected to a series of disappointments. The entire experience left us feeling frustrated, dissatisfied, and vowing never to return.To anyone considering dining at the Eat N Park at Waterfront, I strongly advise against it.",

I was within walking distance of many restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues. The hotel itself was immaculate, with spacious and well-appointed guest rooms. The bed was extremely comfortable, making it easy to relax after long days of meetings and presentations. The bathroom featured high-quality amenities and had plenty of space to move around in. For breakfast each morning, I enjoyed the many options available at the on-site restaurant. The staff I interacted with throughout my stay were all very friendly and eager to assist with any requests. The gym on one of the lower floors had all of the equipment I needed to stay active on my non-meeting days. Using the indoor pool was a nice way to unwind after a day of work.

On my last night, I enjoyed drinks and appetizers in the lobby lounge area with colleagues. Every area of the hotel appeared clean and well-maintained on a daily basis. I would definitely stay at the Westin again next time business brings me back to Charlotte. The central location right in uptown made exploring the city very convenient between work obligations.

        "text": "Here is a 18 sentence continuation of the airport review:The layout of CLT is logically arranged, with three concourses (A,B,C) splitting most domestic and international flights. Signage is generally good throughout the airport to help navigate your journey. The best feature is how quick the security lines usually are - I rarely have to wait more than 10 minutes to pass through screening. Be sure to give yourself at least an hour of buffer time when flying out of here though, as traffic getting to the airport can be heavy at times. Once through security there are plenty of dining options no matter your dietary preferences or budget. Two of my go-to spots are MTY Group's Vida Mexican Kitchen for tacos and Burger Fi for a quick, tasty burger. Free wi-fi is available throughout the terminals as well. Be forewarned that some areas do get very crowded, like near the gates in Concourse A. It's nice that CLT has power outlets scattered throughout to keep devices charged during long layovers.The restrooms are well-maintained from what I've seen. Signs clearly mark where locales like restaurants, shops and gates are located. Across from my gate is usually a comfy seating area with big windows looking out onto the tarmac - perfect for plane-spotting. Flying out of Concourse C offers pretty views of the runway and planes taking off. Perhaps the worst thing is how pricey parking can be if staying for several days.Overall the staff at CLT are friendly, from the TSA to the customer service reps. Flight boards are easily viewable and regularly updated. My pro tip would be utilize the Charlotte Airport app for real-time flight status notifications. Unlike some other airports I've been to, noise levels remain tolerable throughout the terminals. Whether you're arriving or departing, Charlotte Douglas International Airport generally makes the travel experience as smooth as possible.",

I was a bit skeptical at first, but after using it for a few times, I was blown away by how easy it was to style my hair with this tool. The bristles are so soft and gentle on my scalp, and the heat setting is just right for my fine hair. I love that I can adjust the speed and heat settings to customize my blowout, and the cool shot button is perfect for setting my style in place. The fact that it's a brush and dryer in one is pure genius - it cuts down on time and makes my hair look and feel amazing. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I can honestly say it's the best hair tool I've ever owned. Highly recommend!\"",

The gates are packed together with little room for passenger flow, leading to bottlenecks and crowding. Not only are there few places to sit, but what seating is available is old and uncomfortable. Finding food requires trekking to one of the handful of overpriced and mediocre concession stands scattered throughout the terminals. Flight information screens are often out of date or incorrect, causing confusion among travelers trying to locate their gates. Complaints of long security lines and delayed flights are also commonly heard from passengers passing through here. Cleanliness also leaves something to be desired, with debris and spills regularly left unattended. The cramped walkways and disorganization make for an stressful experience even for a short layover. Unless traveling during off hours, expect massive delays and chaos from curb to gate at this airport.",

The ambiance inside was beautiful, with high ceilings, soft lighting and elegant decor. We were seated promptly even though it was a busy Saturday night. The menu had a nice variety of appetizers, salads, pasta, seafood and steaks to choose from. We started with an order of truffle mac and cheese bites which were rich and indulgent. My husband had the filet mignon that came with potatoes and vegetables. The filet was cooked perfectly to order as a nice medium rare and very tender. I opted for the pan seared salmon with risotto and sautéed spinach. The salmon was moist and fresh tasting. Both of our meals were delicious and the perfect portion sizes. The service from our server was excellent, she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She gave us some recommendations based on our food preferences. We also enjoyed the bottle of wine that we ordered, a nice cabernet sauvignon from California that paired well with our dishes. For dessert, we split an order of the chocolate mousse that was so rich and creamy. It was the perfect way to finish off our meal. The bill came to a little over $100 for two people with drinks and an appetizer, which I thought was reasonable for the quality of food. We would definitely come back again to try more things on the menu. The atmosphere and service made for a very enjoyable overall dining experience. The interior design had an upscale yet comfortable vibe. It seemed like most other tables were having a nice time as well based on the chatter and smiles we heard and saw. Our server mentioned they are always busy on the weekends with both regular customers as well as people trying them out during restaurant week. I would recommend this place if you want an elegant dinner out but don't want to break the bank either during a special event.",

This new restaurant downtown really blew me away with their authentic Louisiana dishes. Starting with a basket of hot beignets for an appetizer was the perfect way to begin the meal. The servings were extremely generous without compromising on quality. For my entree I ordered the jambalaya which was packed full of shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage. The different meats and spices were blended together perfectly in the rice. I also got a side of cornbread which had a nice crust on the outside and was moist on the inside. So far everything was top notch. My dining companion got the gumbo which he said had a rich broth and tender okra. We split an order of fried catfish to compare to what we've had in NOLA. The batter was light and crispy without being too greasy. By this point we were stuffed but still made room for dessert. I opted for the banana foster served tableside which was dramatic and delicious. The wait staff was also wonderful with great recommendations and endless refills on iced tea. Based on the authentic flavors and large portions, I'd say this new place is definitely doing Louisiana proud.

Every Friday night after work, I would stop by to grab a California roll and miso soup to bring home for dinner. The staff was always friendly and remembered me as a regular customer. However, after I moved to a new city a few years ago I had all but forgotten about Musashi. That was until I recently went back to Charlotte for a work trip. Feeling nostalgic, I decided to stop by Musashi during my lunch break one day to see if it was still as good as I remembered. When I walked in, I was surprised to see that not much had changed in the restaurant's decor since I was last there years ago. I ordered some salmon nigiri and green tea to start. The fish was as fresh and flavorful as ever. Pleased with the quality so far, I decided to try something new and got chicken teriyaki bowl. It did not disappoint with tender chicken and veggies in a sweet sauce over rice.  By my second visit during the trip, I tried the tempura shrimp Appetizer which was perfectly light and crispy. I also got a pumpkin roll as a change from my usual California roll. It was a welcome seasonally-appropriate refreshment. By the end of my trip, I had been to Musashi three times and enjoyed it just as much as before if not more so. It was clear to me that while I had moved on to pastures new, Musashi remained a reliable option for quality, flavorful Japanese cuisine in Charlotte.

A little bit of courtesy and professionalism can go a long way in making customers feel valued and appreciated.

The lighting was too bright, which created a sterile and impersonal atmosphere. It didn't feel like a place where you could relax and enjoy a meal. Moving on to the service, it was subpar at best. Our server seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the entire meal. It took forever for our orders to be taken, and even longer for the food to arrive at our table. The lack of promptness was a major drawback to the overall dining experience. Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the signature dish, the Atria's Burger. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. The patty was overcooked and dry, completely lacking in flavor. The toppings were sparse and uninspired. It's as if the kitchen didn't put any effort into creating a memorable burger. In addition to the burger, we also ordered a few appetizers to share. The mozzarella sticks were greasy and over-fried, and the buffalo wings were served lukewarm, failing to deliver the desired kick of spice. It seemed like the kitchen was cutting corners and not paying attention to the quality of the dishes being served.One positive aspect I can mention is the drink menu. They had a decent selection of cocktails and beers, allowing us to find something enjoyable to sip on while we waited for our mediocre food. However, even the drinks could not salvage the overall dining experience.To make matters worse, the prices at Atria's were quite steep given the lackluster quality of the food and service. I understand that dining out can be pricey, but I expect a certain level of excellence when I'm paying a premium. Sadly, Atria's fell short in that regard.In conclusion, my visit to Atria's Restaurant left me unimpressed. From the subpar service to the disappointingly bland food, there were several aspects that hindered my enjoyment.",

It's been a challenge finding someone that can. This was the first time in 14 years that I left a salon feeling amazing about my hair. I highly recommend this salon and will definitely be going back. I was worried because most reviews are for people with straight or wavy hair. I will be going back regularly. I got my hair cut and colored by Sarah and she did an amazing job! She listened to what I wanted and gave me suggestions on how to achieve the look I was hoping for. The salon was clean and inviting and everyone there was very nice. I'm so glad I decided to take a chance and try this place out. I was referred by a co-worker and I'm so happy she told me about it. The price was very reasonable for the quality of service I received. I would highly recommend this salon to anyone looking for a great haircut and/or color. Sarah is truly talented and I am so glad I found her. This is definitely my new go-to salon.Thank you, Sarah, for making me feel beautiful!",

I had seen this pecan-crusted mahi on the menu and was intrigued, but balked at the $34 price tag listed next to it. However, my spouse encouraged me to treat myself since it had been a long week. I'm very glad they convinced me to splurge, as it was well worth the cost. The portion was generous, with two thick fillets artfully arranged atop a bed of creamy orzo pilaf. The pecan crust was the perfect contrast to the delicate white fish, adding just the right amount of crunch and nutty flavors. Each bite was light and moist, with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. I savored every last morsel, licking the plate clean afterwards. The accompanying vegetables, which included sautéed haricots verts and vine ripe tomatoes, were simply prepared but brightened up the plate with their colors and flavors. The wait staff also deserves praise for their excellent and attentive service throughout the meal. While I likely won't be ordering the mahi-mahi every time due to its pricey nature, it was a real delicacy that I'm glad I got to experience. I'll be sure to save it for special occasions going forward. Overall, it was one of the most enjoyable and memorable meals I've had in quite some time.",

The experience was so unpleasant that I vowed never to return to this hotel again, and I would advise others to avoid it as well.Upon further research, I discovered that this hotel has a history of similar complaints, and I am not the first to have had such a terrible experience. It is unacceptable that a hotel would subject its guests to such substandard conditions, and I will be reporting my experience to the appropriate authorities.I would give this hotel a rating of zero stars if I could. It was a complete and total disaster, and I will never forget the filth and discomfort that I endured during my stay.I would like to take a moment to advise potential guests to carefully research any hotel before booking a stay. It is important to avoid ending up in a situation like mine, where you are stuck in a dirty and potentially harmful environment with no recourse.In conclusion, my experience at this hotel was a nightmare, and I would strongly advise against staying here. The state of the room, the unhelpfulness of the staff, and the lack of accountability from the management make it a place to avoid at all costs.",

We had to repeatedly ask for refills on water and wait a long time between courses. The filet mignon I ordered was overcooked and lacking in flavor. Even with generous applications of steak sauce I struggled to finish it. My partner had better luck with the chicken dish but said it was nothing special. The sides were basic and forgettable. For dessert we shared a brownie sundae that was too small for two people to enjoy. I was surprised by the small portion sizes given the steakhouse prices. The dining room was crowded but noisy, without much effort to control the volume. Overall the atmosphere felt more like a chains than an upscale establishment. I noticed many empty tables by the time we left, which was only an hour after being seated. Based on this experience I do not plan to return to this restaurant. There are better steakhouses in the area that take pride in their food and service. I'd suggest saving your money and patronizing one of the local favorites instead.

On busy travel days, it can feel like the planes are taking off almost back to back. No matter the time of day, there isn't really a break between planes arriving and departing. As you walk around the airport, you spend most of your time looking up at the sky to watch the planes. Sometimes multiple planes will line up to take off simultaneously on different runways. Even when sitting inside the terminal it's hard to have a conversation without having to pause until a plane passes overhead. All the activity gives the impression that this is one of the busiest airports in the entire country. Travelers flood the gates as planes park at the extended jetways. The terminal gets very crowded as people hustle to make their connections. It's easy to get turned around in the endless airport corridors filled with people. There are stores, restaurants and bars scattered throughout the terminals to help pass the time between flights. Gate agents have their hands full wrangling passengers and dealing with delays and cancellations. The airport staff work tirelessly to keep things running smoothly under such high volume conditions. Be prepared for long walks between concourses since some areas of the airport are quite massive. There are many places to grab a quick snack or meal but seating can be hard to find during peak travel periods.

Yet their sign advertising fresh catch of the day from the docks was too tempting to pass up. When the scampi arrived, it looked fairly fresh despite being hundreds of miles from the coast. However, after just a few bites I started to feel slightly nauseous. The seafood clearly wasn't as fresh as advertised if it was making me feel ill already. Around the halfway point of my meal, the nausea grew much worse very quickly. I rushed to the bathroom but didn't make it in time before becoming violently sick all over the floor. Despite asking nicely, the staff seemed completely unconcerned by the mess and made no effort to clean it up for many minutes. After cleaning myself up as best I could, I returned to my table hoping I could at least finish my drink. But the smell of vomit lingering in the air now ruined any hope of enjoying the rest of my meal. I asked for the manager to explain what happened and request my money back. They grudgingly refunded me but were clearly annoyed at having to do so. Clearly this land locked restaurant should avoid advertising seafood if they cannot obtain and serve it fresh. I thought longingly of the coast as I drove the several hours home, still feeling unwell from the bad scampi. It will definitely be a while before I take another chance on seafood away from the ocean. This disappointing meal was an expensive lesson to stick to simpler fare when eating far from the source. In the future, I will be more skeptical of any \"fresh\" seafood options too far from the docks to genuinely deserve that label.",

However, the restaurant decorated with rustic charm that far exceeded my expectations.  Wooden tables were polished to a shine and gas lanterns hanging from the ceiling lent a warm glow throughout the dining room. When the hostess seated us, she offered freshly baked cornbread and spread that smelled of honey. The menu featured local delicacies alongside classics cooked with Southern flair. I started with fried green tomatoes that melted in my mouth. For my entree, I chose the catfish po'boy that came piled high between two halves of a bulky roll. The fish was crispy and flaky, complemented perfectly by the creamy rémoulade. My dining companion raved about the shrimp and grits in a sage-infused broth. The flavors blended together in rich harmony. All around us, tables of patrons laughed and chatted, clearly enjoying their meals. Our server came by often to refill water glasses and make sure we didn't want for anything. When we couldn't finish our meals, containers were provided for leftovers. The check came promptly but without rushing us out the door. As we stepped outside into the warm evening air, I was reluctant to leave the quaint charm of the restaurant. The whole experience left me feeling satisfied and wanting to linger in this pocket of Southern hospitality a while longer. I will definitely return next time I'm in the area to see what new flavors they've put on the menu.",

It took an unusually long time for us to be seated, and once we were, the wait for our orders to be taken was equally frustrating. The menu offered a variety of options, but the quality of the food did not match up to the initial impression. Our dishes arrived lukewarm and lacked the flavor and finesse one would expect from a restaurant of this reputation. Moreover, the portion sizes were disappointingly small given the prices charged. The noise level in the dining area was overwhelming, making it difficult to hold a conversation without shouting. Additionally, the tables were cramped together, resulting in a lack of privacy and uncomfortable dining experience. Overall, despite its initial promise, this place failed to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving us disappointed and unlikely to return in the future.",

The decor was nothing to write home about, with the same old red and gold color scheme and generic Chinese artwork adorning the walls.The staff seemed friendly enough, but their English was limited to a few basic phrases like \"Hello, welcome!\" and \"How are you, sir/ma'am?\" They didn't seem to bother with asking about any dietary restrictions or preferences, and just assumes that everyone wanted the usual - a heaping plate of General Tso's chicken and fried rice.The food, unsurprisingly, was nothing special. The entrees all tasted like they'd been dredged in the same set of sauces and seasonings, and the veggies were overcooked and mushy. Even the usually reliable standbys like Kung Pao chicken and egg rolls were disappointing, with the former being too sweet and the latter tasting like it had been sitting out for hours.I did appreciate the variety of options, though - they had all the usual suspects like hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, and a smattering of beef and seafood dishes. And the portions were generous, to say the least - I left feeling stuffed and slightly regretting my decision to go for the \"all-you-can-eat\" option.Overall, it was a somewhat forgettable experience - not terrible, but not particularly memorable either. If you're in the area and craving Chinese food, it might be worth a visit. But if you're looking for something authentic or truly delicious, you might want to keep looking.",

We perused the menu, which boasted an impressive array of both classic and innovative dishes.For appetizers, we decided to indulge in a selection of small plates to share. The crispy calamari was delicately seasoned and accompanied by a tangy dipping sauce that added a delightful kick. Next, we savored the melt-in-your-mouth beef sliders, perfectly cooked to medium-rare and topped with a rich cheese blend.As we moved on to the main course, the waitstaff continued to impress us with their attentiveness and genuine enthusiasm for the cuisine. I opted for the grilled salmon, which was impeccably cooked and served with a vibrant citrus glaze that complemented the delicate fish flavors. My husband chose the succulent ribeye steak, cooked to perfection and accompanied by a velvety red wine reduction.The side dishes were equally impressive. The roasted vegetables were a symphony of flavors and textures, highlighting the freshness of the seasonal produce. We also couldn't resist the truffle-infused mashed potatoes, a creamy and indulgent delight that elevated the entire meal.Although we were already quite satisfied, the dessert menu tempted us with its irresistible offerings. We decided to share the chef's signature chocolate lava cake, and it was a decision we didn't regret. The warm, oozing chocolate center paired with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream created a mouthwatering combination that left us in dessert heaven.",

I went with the burger which was a thick patty cooked perfectly medium with lettuce, tomato, onion, and special sauce on a soft bun. The flavors all came together nicely on the burger.

The bartenders were friendly and took care to ensure all customers felt comfortable. The drinks were reasonably priced for the neighborhood and offered creative specialty cocktails in addition to typical beer and liquor options. Customers seemed to enjoy socializing with a mix of small groups and individuals engaging in casual conversation at the tables and bar. Music playing was more mainstream pop and rock rather than dance club songs, keeping the environment laidback. Several LGBT pride flags hung on the walls as subtle indications of the bar's inclusive values. The outdoor patio was a nice added feature on the warm evenings, allowing more comfortable seating options. Overall the vibe seemed low-key and allowed for relaxed socializing without feeling like a loud dance club scene. Hartigans has carved out its own niche with a blend of Irish traditions and welcoming community spirit.

The exterior of the restaurant is unassuming, but the interior is warm and inviting. The service was friendly and attentive, and the menu offered a wide variety of options. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was flavorful and tender. The portion size was generous, and the price was reasonable.Next, I visited People's.

If you're looking for a more authentic Indian experience, Taste of India might be the better choice. However, if you're looking for a more modern take on Indian cuisine, People's is worth checking out.",

As we came in, an employee approached us to ask if we needed help. I thanked her and told her what we were looking for. She seemed to not know what a harness was, which I found odd since we were in a pet store. When I explained what I needed, she immediately directed us to the cat section of the store. I explained that we needed a harness for a dog, not a cat. She apologized for the confusion and directed us to a different section of the store. Once we got there, it appeared they only had harnesses for very large dogs. I asked the same employee if they carried anything for a smaller dog, perhaps in the 20-pound range. She informed me they didn't carry any. It was rather disappointing considering the size of the store. It seemed like a place that would have everything we would need for our pet, yet it didn't. We ended up leaving the store empty-handed. We drove 20 minutes to another location and found exactly what we needed right away. I have always liked this particular location of the store, and I have been a customer for many years. But after my last visit, I'm not sure I will return.",

It seems like they actively avoid helping customers and just want to end calls as quickly as possible. The equipment they provide is cheap and unreliable, with the cable boxes and modems constantly needing to be reset or replaced. Upgrades and new installations also take forever to complete, leaving customers without service for weeks at a time. Even routine maintenance often disrupts service for hours or days without warning. The speeds we pay for are rarely actually delivered, especially during peak hours. Outages are also far too common, whether planned or unplanned. Their website and billing are an endless source of confusion and frustration as well. It's nearly impossible to get an accurate bill or make meaningful changes to your account online. Their rates also increase annually at an unjustifiable rate but we have no other real options for service in our area. At this point, I think anything would be better than Time Warner Cable. If another provider offered service here I would switch immediately, no matter the cost, just to get away from the poor service and outdated equipment. Time Warner Cable may have once been a leader in the industry but they have clearly fallen very far behind. Unless they make drastic improvements soon, I fear they will continue losing more and more customers to cord cutting and newer competitors. Their poor reputation is fully deserved based on my many negative experiences as a long time customer.",

Their salt bagel always hit the spot with its hearty texture and just the right amount of saltiness on the exterior. However, in recent years I've noticed their quality declining and inconsistencies rising. The bagels seem thinner and denser, lacking the airy quality they once had. On top of that, getting the saltiness just right seems to be a struggle for them now. Some salt bagels are heavily coated while others barely have any salt at all. This got me thinking about exploring other bagel options in my area. I came across a new local shop that focused on hand-rolled bagels made fresh daily. Their menu was smaller than Bruegger's but emphasized quality over quantity. On a whim I decided to give them a try. From the moment I walked in I was impressed by the aroma of freshly baking bread. When it was my turn to order I got intrigued by their description of the Everything bagel and went with that instead of a salt bagel. Bringing the warm Everything bagel home, I cut it open and was struck by its height and airy texture. The seasoning was also perfectly balanced, with garlic, sesame, and poppy seeds mingling together tantalizingly on the crust. I took my first bite and was instantly transported - the flavor and consistency were unparalleled to anything I'd had from Bruegger's recently. Over the next few weeks I tried several of their other bagel varieties like cinnamon raisin, plain, and whole wheat. Each one impressed me with a consistency that Bruegger's seems to have lost.",

Their jeans, tees, and hoodies have a classic look that never goes out of style. Plus, Old Navy has size options for men, women, and kids so it's easy to find something that fits well. The stores also have good sales throughout the year so savvy shoppers can find great deals. Old Navy clothes are made to last through many washes without shrinking or losing shape. Some criticize the brand for fast fashion trends, but their staples never feel trendy or dated after a season or two. Wearing Old Navy is comfortable and allows people to express individual style without breaking the bank. Not everything needs to be designer to look polished. Their comfortable fabrics in year-round colors make easy outfits for school, work, or play. Overall Old Navy provides good value and quality for the price point without skimping on style. There is no need for hate - it's a brand that works for most people's budgets.",

When I arrived at Musashi, I was immediately impressed by the traditional Japanese interior decorated with paper lanterns and bamboo details. A host showed me to a small table where I was given an English menu to browse as well as hot green tea. There was a wide selection of dishes including soups, rice dishes, noodles and teriyaki options. I decided to start with the miso soup and edamame to begin. Both were light, fresh and flavorful. For my main dish, I chose the beef sukiyaki which came bubbling in the iron pot right to my table. I enjoyed dipping thinly sliced beef and vegetables into the savory broth. The meal was very hearty and satisfying. After I finished, the waitress brought me a sample of seasonal fruit for dessert. It was the perfect way to end such a filling meal. The service throughout my dinner was attentive yet not overbearing. As I left well fed, I saw many families and groups of friends enjoying their meals. It was clear Musashi has built a loyal local customer base. I would highly recommend this gem for anyone looking for authentic and well prepared Japanese cuisine. The generous portions and reasonable prices also make Musashi a very good value. I'm thankful to the Hatoya cashier for the dining recommendation and am sure to return to Musashi again soon during my next visit to the city.",

For our main courses, my mom opted for the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection and served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.

The process to buy tickets online is very simple and only takes a few minutes. Just go to the venue website, select the date and seats you want, and pay securely with a credit or debit card. You will instantly receive an email confirmation with a barcode that can be scanned upon entry. This ticket less system eliminates the need to worry about losing paper tickets or dealing with will call lines. For popular shows, buying early is crucial to secure good seats before sections sell out. As show time nears, the best seats vanish and prices occasionally increase. With online tickets in hand, you can arrive right as the show starts without stressing about lines or availability. The money you save can go towards tasty snacks or souvenirs inside. Plus online ticketing is better for the environment by reducing physical paper waste. So do yourself a favor and purchase in advance to relax and fully enjoy the experience. You'll be glad you skipped the box office and secured such a good deal. Not to mention any additional surprises or perks that occasionally accompany online ticket orders.

I visited the restaurant last night with a group of friends and was looking forward to trying their famous burgers. Unfortunately, the service was slow and inattentive, and the food was not up to my expectations.Firstly, it took a long time for our server to take our orders, and even then, she seemed annoyed and rushed through the process. When our food arrived, it was clear that the kitchen had made a few mistakes. One of my friends ordered a salad, but they accidentally gave him a burger instead.To make matters worse, the burger was overcooked and dry. I ordered a medium-rare burger, but what I got was a well-done patty that was borderline burnt. The fries were also underwhelming, with a strange flavor that didn't complement the meat at all.We tried to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and ordered a few more dishes, but unfortunately, they were also subpar. The mac and cheese was watery and lacked any depth of flavor, and the chicken wings were overcooked and tasted like they had been sitting out for hours.I'm really disappointed in Harris Grill because I've been to their other locations and have always had a good experience. It's possible that this particular location is understaffed or having an off day, but I'm not sure if I'll be willing to give them another chance.I hope management takes note of this review and does something to improve the quality of their food and service. Until then, I would recommend that people avoid this location and try one of their other restaurants instead.",

The flavors are just not as rich and bold as I expect from an Italian restaurant.Theambiance is pleasant, with a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. But when the food doesn't deliver, it's hard to overlook. I've given them the benefit of the doubt multiple times, but unfortunately, my last visit was the final straw.I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was overcooked and lacked the creaminess that this dish is known for. The bacon was also overcooked and tasted more like burnt offerings than an enhancement to the dish. It was a disappointment, to say the least.I also tried their signature dish, the Girasole, which is a stuffed pasta dish filled with ricotta cheese and topped with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella. It was bland and uninspired, with a texture that was a bit too chewy.The prices are reasonable, but considering the inconsistent quality of the food, I don't think it's worth the money.Maybe I'm just too used to the rich flavors of authentic Italian cuisine, but Girasole doesn't live up to my expectations.I'd love to see them improve their recipes and use fresher, higher-quality ingredients. If that happens, I'd be happy to give them another try.Until then, I'll have to stick to my family's recipes or seek out other Italian restaurants that deliver on their promises.It's a shame, because the atmosphere at Girasole is really nice, and the staff is friendly and attentive.But at the end of the day, it's all about the food, and sadly, Girasole just doesn't cut it for me.",

        "text": "I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. The latest installment of the franchise fails to live up to its predecessors. From the moment the movie begins, it becomes painfully clear that it lacks the depth and charm that made the previous films so enjoyable. The plot feels disjointed, with poorly developed storylines and underdeveloped characters. The pacing is all over the place, making it difficult to fully invest in the narrative. The dialogue, often cringe-worthy and uninspired, does little to engage the audience or create any emotional connection. The acting performances are lackluster, with the cast struggling to elevate the weak script they were given. Additionally, the visual effects, which used to be a highlight of the series, appear rushed and unimpressive. The action sequences feel repetitive and lack any real sense of excitement or stakes. Even the score, which was once a memorable aspect of the franchise, fails to leave a lasting impression. The film seems to rely heavily on nostalgia, hoping that the familiar characters and references will be enough to satisfy the audience. However, this reliance on past glory only serves as a stark reminder of how far the series has fallen. Ultimately, this installment feels like a cash grab with little regard for the quality or coherence of the story. It's a disheartening experience for fans who were hoping for a return to form. In conclusion, while Matthew U makes a valid point, this film is a disappointment and a missed opportunity to revive the franchise.",

I went with the prime NY strip that was perfectly charred on the outside and still a bright pink center. Both steaks were juicy and flavorful and accompanied by delicious sides like mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. We shared a bottle of cabernet sauvignon that paired nicely with our meals. Both too full for dessert, we finished our wines while chatting about the great food and our time in Charlotte.

The walls were adorned with intricate stone carvings, and the roof was topped with gleaming silver turrets. I pulled into the parking lot, which was surprisingly empty given the impressive facade of the building.As I stepped out of my car, I was greeted by the sound of gentle medieval music floating from within the castle walls. My curiosity piqued, I made my way towards the entrance, where I was warmly welcomed by a hostess dressed in traditional German attire.Upon entering the main hall, I was struck by the stunning architecture and attention to detail. The high ceilings, ornate tapestries, and polished wooden floors all added to the regal ambiance of the space.I was escorted to my table, which offered a breathtaking view of the surrounding countryside. The menu, adorned with illustrations of knights and dragons, promised a culinary experience fit for royalty.I ordered the signature dish, a delectable combination of sauerkraut, sausage, and potato, all washed down with a stein of frothy German beer. The flavors were exquisite, with each bite transporting me further into the fantastical world of the castle.As I dined, I couldn't help but marvel at the eccentric decor, which included suits of armor, ancient weaponry, and even a unicorn horn. It was clear that no detail had been overlooked in creating this enchanting atmosphere.As the night wore on, I was treated to a performance by a troupe of jesters, who regaled me with tales of chivalry and heroism. Their antics were hilarious, and I found myself laughing and clapping along with the other patrons.As I finished my meal, I realized that this was no ordinary restaurant. It was an immersive experience, transporting visitors to a time of knights and dragons, of myth and magic.I left the castle feeling exhilarated and refreshed, with memories that would last a lifetime.",

The market features a variety of locally grown produce sold directly by the farmers who grew it. I appreciate being able to put a face to the people who work hard to provide fresh, healthy food. In addition to vegetables, you can also find meats, cheeses, baked goods and other specialty items. The quality of the products is excellent and the prices are very reasonable considering it is farm fresh. There is a nice community feeling at the market as visitors stroll through the booths, chatting with vendors. On pleasant weekends it can get quite crowded so plan to go early for the best selection. My favorite vendors are the Smith family orchard and their delicious pies and Tony's produce stand with the biggest tomatoes I've ever seen. The gallery space hosting the market has plenty of room and outdoor seating if you want to enjoy your purchases on site. Overall, Pickles Farmers Market is a delightful way to support local agriculture and get top notch ingredients.",

Visitors can see various historic aircraft on display both indoors and outdoors, including jets, helicopters, and planes from different eras. One of the highlights is a restored P-40 Warhawk fighter from World War 2. In addition to static aircraft, the museum also has exhibits that showcase the history of aviation through artifacts, photographs and interactive displays. Children especially enjoy the flight simulator that lets them experience what it's like to pilot different types of aircraft. For aviation enthusiasts, it's fascinating to learn details about the design and engineering behind these planes. Be sure to allow a couple hours to fully explore the museum and take in all it has to offer. Overall the Carolina's Aviation Museum provides an entertaining and educational look at the development of air travel over the past century.",

It was an incredibly busy property that saw over 10,000 guests each month. As the head of operations, no two days were ever the same and it seemed there was always some new challenge to tackle. From addressing customer complaints to managing hundreds of staff members, the job required juggling countless tasks on a daily basis. Despite the hectic pace, I enjoyed the thrill and excitement of working in such a prestigious luxury hotel. It was very rewarding to help create memorable experiences for our distinguished guests. However, the long hours and demanding schedule did take its toll at times. There were many late nights spent helping to resolve complicated issues that arose. During my five years in the role, I saw the hotel expand and undergo several renovations to improve its offerings.The work could be stressful, but I appreciated the opportunity to take on such an important leadership position at a young age. It allowed me to develop valuable management skills that have served me well in my career. One of the things I treasured most was interacting with travelers from all over the globe on a daily basis. I found it fascinating to learn about different cultures and perspectives through conversations with our clientele. However, the fast pace of the industry eventually became unsustainable for my personal life and health. While I have many fond memories of my time there, I knew it was time for a change when I found myself constantly exhausted. Now, I work in a less demanding role where I have a better work-life balance. Although I miss certain aspects of the hotel industry, I don't regret making the transition when I did.",

From the moment I opened the package, I was immediately greeted with disappointment. The build quality of the product felt flimsy and cheap, causing doubts about its longevity.Upon trying out the main features, I found them to be lackluster at best. The performance was underwhelming, with frequent lag and unresponsive controls. It was frustrating to navigate through the interface, which felt convoluted and poorly designed. Basic functions that should have been intuitive proved to be a hassle, leaving me feeling frustrated and bewildered.The advertised functionality boasted a seamless user experience, but I found myself constantly encountering glitches and errors. The device would frequently freeze or crash, forcing me to restart it multiple times. This major flaw significantly hindered my overall satisfaction with the product.Additionally, the battery life was abysmal. Despite claims of extended usage, I constantly found myself having to recharge the device, which was highly inconvenient. This lack of longevity further added to my growing list of disappointments.Furthermore, I reached out to customer support regarding my concerns, but the experience was equally disheartening. Their responses were slow and unhelpful, leaving me feeling unheard and abandoned as a consumer.In conclusion, I regretfully cannot recommend this product to others. Its underwhelming performance, subpar build quality, frustrating user interface, and constant glitches make it a poor investment. I advise potential buyers to explore alternatives that offer better functionality and a more satisfying user experience. Save your time and money, and avoid the hassle that comes with this product.",

The lack of organization within the aisles only added to the frustration, with similar products scattered haphazardly throughout different sections.The checkout process was another disappointment.

Despite the initial promptness of the server, there was a noticeable absence of attentiveness throughout the meal.
