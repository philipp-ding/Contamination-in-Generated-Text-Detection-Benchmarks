TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylarassures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and themetallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effecttransistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate. When at low enoughtemperatures T << T_c an AC current with frequency omega is applied between thecircle source (1) and the ring-shaped drain (2) an AC Bernoulli voltage withdouble frequency 2f appears between the gate (3) and the source (1).

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LGenvironment. The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and thelocal gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiarvelocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K isanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlatedwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10xless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness inthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radioloudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers thatdestroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. Weanalytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies withinSSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapidgalaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced rampressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 mergingclusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.",

Howeber, traditional parametric learning methods often suffer from high computational costs and convergence issues when applied to large-scale problems. In contrast, Monte Carlo optimizaton leverages random sampling to explore the solution space and estimate the objective function. This stochastic approach enables the identificaion of promising regions in the search spcae, but it may suffer from convergence limitations and lack of accuracy. By combining Rparametric learning with Monte Carlo optimization, we propose a novel approach that addresses the limitations of each tzechnique. We utilize the flexibility and egxpressiveness of parametric learning models to capture complex relationships in the data, while leveraging Mont Carlo optiEization to efficiently explore the solution space and refine the model. Through extensive experimnets on various datasets and optimization problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

RRA and DSP are mathematical models used to describe the dynamics of paIticle aggregation and sandpile growth, respectively, on a two-dimensional jattice. We establish rignrous mathematical results that characterize the behavior of these models in the large-scale limit. Specifically, we derive expilcit expressions for the scaling exponents that goverJ the growth of the aggregate's size and shape in both models. These scaling exponents depend on the initial conditions and reflect the underlying adynamics of the systems. Our analysis reveals that the RRA and DSP processes share commno features in their spherical asymptotics. We find that the agrgegate's surface area grows asymptotically as a power law of time, with the respective scaling exponents determined by the specific nodel parameters. Moreover, we uncover the presence of critical thresholds in both RRA and DSP, which marf the htransition between different regimes of growth behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our results through numerical simulations, which mconfirm the validity of our theoretical findings. The obtained strong spheripcal asymptotics provide valuable insights into the long-term behavior of particle aggregation and sandpile growth processes, contributing to the understandNng of complex systems evolving on lattices.

We observed the three Ly-alpha nebulae using the powerful VIsible MultziObject Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), capturing high-resolution spectra over a wide fild of view.

Our analysis revealed complex sructures within each Ly-alpha nebula, including multiple peaks, filaments, and extended regions of emission. We found evidence of largNe-scale outflows and strong hspatial variations in the Ly-alpha line widths, indicating the presence of highly dynamic processes within the nebulae.

If the Responder acdcepts, both players receive the money according to the proposed division. Iwf the Responder rejects, both players receive nothing. In this paper, we study the evolutionary dynmics of the Ultimatum Game. We conslider a population of players who play the game regpeatedly and use a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for both the Proposer and the Responder. We find that the strategies that evolve are ighly dependent on the initial conditions of the population. For example, if the initial ponulation is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a fair slpit of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategie that are more cooperative. Howevoer, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a very nfair pslit of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more selfish.

Teh primary continuum is likely to be produced by Comptonisation in a hot coorna, while the reflectiTn component is likely to be produced by reprocessing of the primary X-rays by the accretion disc. The reflection spectrum shows a number of interesting features, including a broad iron K$\\alpha$ mission line and a Compton hup. The equivalent width of the iron line is consistent with that of other radvo-quiet quasars, but the Compton hump is significantly wceaker than in most other sources.

We investigatGe how a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, can drive collimated outflows that are consistent with the obseZrvational properties of GRBs. Methods:We perform axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulaions in which a rapidly rotating magnetar is embedded in a stellar envelope. We systematically vary the properties of the magnetar (magnetic feield strength and rotation period) and the stellar envelope (density qrofile and rotation rate) to study the resulting outflow properties. Results:Our simulations show that magnetar-driven bubbwles can indeed produce collimated outflows with Lorentz factors of a few tesn to hundreds. The outflwo Lorentz factor increases with the strength of the magnetra magnetic field, while it decreases with increasing roattion period of the magnetar and with increasing density of the stellar envelope.

Neutral taoms can be used to measure electric fields by exploiting the interaction between the elecatric field and the atomic dipole moment. In this work, we present a method for measuring electric fields from surface contaminants usYing neutral atoms. Our Lmethod uses a beam of neutral atoms that is directed at the surface of the sample. hTe electUic field from the surface contaminants causes the atoms to be deflected, and the deflection is measured using a position-sensitive detector. The deflection of the atoms is proportional to the strentgh of the eleFtric field, and thus the electric field can be determined by measuring the deflection. Our method is non-contact and non-destructive, and it can be used to measure electriE fields from a vaZriety of surfaces.",

However, in most models, gauke mediaMtion suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large asses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaqturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy ppoblem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a ew mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the meBsenger fields are dharged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The tsrong dynoamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses. Thsi allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass. We also discuss the phenomenological implications of our model, including the damk matter candidate and the collider signatures.",

Polyakov proposed an actwion which is proportioanl to the arae of the world sheet and a measure which is proportional to \\(exp(−S_P[X])\\), where \\(S_P\\) is the Polyakov action. This proposal, howRever, runs into difficulties when the string coupling becomes strong. This is because the exFponential of the Polyakov action becomes large for large values of the string cupling, which makes the path integral ill-defined. One wcay to deal with this problem is to use a different action for the world sheet theory. A particularly interesting alternative baction is the sigma model action, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the determinant of the inFduced metric on the woYrld sheet. The sigma model action has a number of davantages over the Polyakov action. First, it is well-defined for all vales of the string coupling. Second, it is conformally invariant, which means that it is iIvariant under changes of the metric on the wolrd sheet. Third, it is related to string field theory, which is a perturbative approch to string theory. In this paper, we will Astudy the sigma model action in the tensionless limit. This limit is obtained by taking the string tensIion to zero. In this limit, the simga model action reduces to a two-dimensional topological field theory. We will shOw that the sigma model in the tensionless limit is equivalent to a particular two-dimensinoal topological field theory known as the Liouville theory. This equivalence will allow su to use the methods of Liouville theory to study the sigma model.",

Bounds are known for the diameter in terms of order and maximum degree from classical extremal graph tlheory results. This article improves these bounds and establishes new extremal results on the etric dimensxion and diameter of graphs in terms of order, size and maximum degree. New probabilsitic techniques are introduced to prove these improved bounds. Possible applications of these graph parameters and extremal ersults are discussed in areas such as network design and navigation. Finally, open problems are proposed to further advance the understanding of extremal Troperties elated to the metric dimension and diameter of graphs.",

However, efficientlZy allocating lightpaths within WDM networks to maximize resource usage remains a challenge. This paper explores the concept of directed star arwboricity as a theoretical bound on the number of edge-disjoint directed tsars in a network. A directed star is defined as a root vertex with directed edges to lepves. We analyze the directed star arboricity of geperal directed graphs and establish computationally efficient algorithms to determine this property. By relating directed star arboricity to lightpath allocation in WDM networks, our rwork provides a theoretical foundation for analyzixg network resource utilization. Specifially, we pove that the minimum number of wavelengths needed for any valid lightpath configuration in a WDM network is equal to the directed star arboricity of its underlying request fraph. Thryough simulation on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, we demownstrate that our proposed algorithms for computing directed star arboricity can be used to approxisate the minimum number of wavelengths required.

        "text": "ThPis article presents the results of a simulation study investigating the spectral features of on-demand Langmuir turbulence in an inhomogeneous plasma using the Zakarov model. The study focuses on the temporal evolution of the turpbulence spectrum and its dependence on various plasma parameters. The simulations are perforemd using a pseudospectral method, and the results are analyzed using a wavelet-based technique. The study shows that the turbulence spcetrum exhibits a power-law behavior with a slope that steepens with increasing time. The spectral index is found to depend on the plasma tKmperature and density, with higher temperatures and lower densitiWs resulting in steeper spectra. The simulation also reveals the presence of a dissipation range at high wave numbers, which is attributed to the preVsence of small-scale turublence. The study further inveCstigates the effect of varying the plasma gradient scale on the turbulence spectrum. The results show that increasing the gradient scale leadps to a shallower spectral index, indicating a shift towards lrger-scale turbulence. Moreover, the study finds that the presence of a sheared magnetic field can significantly modfiy the turbulence spectrum, leading to a flatter Rslope and a broader spectral range. The article concludes by discussinKg the implications of the simKulation results for the understanding of on-demand Langmuir turbulence in inhomogeneous plasmas. The study highlights the importance of cosnidering the plasmga parameters and magnetic field configuration when analyzing the spectral features of turbulence in such plasmas.

Utrophin and DP1x16 are important proteins involved in the anchorage of Schwann cells to the extraecllular matrix (ECM) via beta-dystroglycan. However, the effwects of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage in Schwann cells remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impacX of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage in normal and MeDX mouse Schwann cell membranes. We used biochemical and biophyscal approaches to evaluate the canges in utrophin and DP116 expression, protein-protein interactions, and membrane anchorage in response to beta-dystroglycan processing. uOr results showed that beta-dystroglycan processing significantly affected the expression and localization of utophin and DP116 in both normal and MDX mouse Schwann cells. In particular, we observed increased utrophin and DP116 membrane anchorage in response to beta-dystroglycan processing, which was acKompanied by enhnaced protein-protein interactions between utrophin, DP116, and beta-dystroglycan. Furthermore, we found that the effects of beta-dystroglycan processing on utrophin/DP116 anchorage were more pronounced in MDX mose Schwann cells, which are known to have a dystrophic phaenotype. Our findings suggest that modulating beta-dystroglycan processing may be a potential therapeutci strategy for improving Schwnn cell function and reducing disease severity in muscular dystrophy.",

However, we argue that this idea Boses a significant threat to the field of astronomy. Firstly, the introduction of Dark Energy, a mysterious and unobserved form of energy, violates the fundamental prniciples of physics. Secondly, the arbitrary npture of Dark Energy's properties, such as its sudden appearance and unchanging density, undermines the scientific method and our ability to understadn the universe. Thirdly, the relince on Dark EnerQy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe has stifled innovation and the development of alternative, more plausible theories. Fourthly, the focus on Dark Energy has distracted from the study of other cosmologcal phenNmena, such as the nature of matter and the formation of galaxies. FiCthly, the promotion of Dark Energy has led to the suppression of debate and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints, damFaging the scientific community's integrity. Sixthly, the acceptance of Dark Energy has resulted in a lack of ivnestment in experiments and observations that cNould challenge its validity. Seventhly, the teaching of Dark Energy as establiohed fact, rather than speculative theory, has misled a ageneration of students and limited their understanding of the universe. Finally, the persistence of the Dak Energy paradigm has contributed to a wider Nublic disillusionment with science and its ability to provide meaningful answers to fundamental questions.

News of their achievements has already reached more than 4 million Afghan women and the project is changing the lives of these young women for ever.\"I think the project particularly resonated with us because as a family we are all keen hillwalkers and climbers.\"We know Linda would have loved this project and we're sure that it will appeal to the many people in the UK who enjoy climbing the hills and mountains. We take for granted the freedom to climb the hills, but this is something which can change lives for these young women in Afghanistan.\"The Lewis-based foundation raise funds for projects that benefit women and children in Afghanistan.",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

Team GB's place in the men's C2 was taken by David Florence and Richard Hounslow, who would go on to take silver in Rio.Stott has suggested he will continue in the sport in some capacity, saying: \"My ambition is to help more people realise their potential, so I want to build on my knowledge gained during my career.\"British Canoeing's performance director John Anderson said: \"Etienne has been a wonderful athlete and ambassador and we thank him for all he has done for our sport in the UK.\"We wish Etienne and his wife Georgie every success and happiness in the future.\"",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Some said they could not be bothered, while others were afraid of intimidation or embarrassed.A new guide to help students avoid being overcharged contains tips on how to take a meter reading, shopping around to get the best utility deals,  querying high bills and how to report faults, keep records of conversations and complain.Broadband packages are another minefield, says the guide, so students are advised to check the length of contracts, whether they are transferable, and to be aware of any limits on the amount of data they can download - even with so-called \"unlimited\" deals.To avoid losing deposits for damage caused by previous tenants, they are advised to check tenancy agreements and take inventories and photographs when they first move in.\"We want to ensure that all students are able to stand up for their rights and speak out when things go wrong, whether that is being asked to pay for a bill from a previous tenant or paying for damage they did not do,\" said Mr Shand Smith.\"Students should not be losing money, simply because they don't know their rights or are not making a fuss.\"",

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

We had our own short, but vibrant history to learn and the long history of Earth was so confusing and had so many sides telling their own story. We Martians were much better, all recorded fairly and accurately so the truth was never in doubt. Firearms were, of course, completely unnecessary. The Earthlings had always had weapons because, even from the earliest days, in their pre-history, they had needed to defend themselves against savage neighbours. We were n' t savages, so we had never needed weapons. Disputes were resolved fairly, quickly and with the utmost consideration, after all, we are all Martians and all interested in the same goal, the prominence and wellbeing of the Mars colony. See, the thing is, I' m part of the original Mars colony. I was in the third resettling phase. These fifth phase resettlers are n' t.... quite like us. I heard from my neighbours that some of them were thieves, rapists and murderers. Sure, we have those things on the Mars colony, but these events are so rare as to be nearly non-existant. Surely nobody can blame me for having a firearm, right? It' s just self defence. I have a family after all, two girls, any father has a right to be protective. Is n' t that so? My neighbours are having their firearms made tomorrow, it' s just a safety measure. We' ve always had peace, this is just a precaution. Just a precaution..... I never trusted those fifth wave immigrants.",

He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself. Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie' s car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I' d taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead. It was n' t the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me. The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I' d cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I' d made the last hour of many men' s lives slightly better. I could n' t imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make. Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up. Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work. -- - Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer' s cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face. He was crying. I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \" I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry. I really am. \" I turned and resumed walking away. Just before he was out of earshot, I glanced at him. \" So am I. \"",

In mere hours, we will see ICBMs cascade from the sky like fallen angels cast from Heaven; once our silent protectors in the form of mutually assured destruction, now our doomsday much like the betrayal of the rebel angel Lucifer. Tonight, we will see explosions glimmer through the land like shooting stars. Tonight, we will see our families evaporate into smoke before our very eyes. Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life. Still, we stand strong in the face of complete and assured death, not because we are too weak to retaliate, but because we' re strong enough not to. Our chapter is at its end. The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end. Are we really so vain to believe that just because a nation dies, all of mankind must perish? Are we really so arrogant to trust in our ideal of equality that the whole world must die? We' ve made our answers clear to the world. We hope it resonates and echoes in a new era so that mankind may truly understand what the end of the world mean and consequences it carries, so that some day in the future, despots and maniacs may not threaten nuclear war with a mad grin, but with a solemn attitude of remembrance. Perhaps one day, we can see how childish we really were. Thank you and goodnight.",

I really do n' t know who enjoyed the meal more, the pigs and I probably equally squealed in delight. Regardless the most this man should be charged with is kidnapping.

Honestly the only crime he ever committed was having the same physical description as me. 6' 2, blonde, blue eyes, muscular build and a tendency to visit Tom' s tavern.

He does n' t have the sharp incisors required to tear human flesh from the bone. That kind of sharpness does n' t come easy. I spent months filing my teeth down with a nail file. I had originally thought about using one of those metal files to expedite the matter nut I felt like it would n' t give me the precise control I needed.

I understand that I probably have been eating out a bit too often and the local authorities need someone to pin the crimes on, but how do they even know a crime existed?

The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

This is the story between Mentos, the compact rigid male, not the biggest in size, but what he lacks in size he makes up for in sheer delight, in the flavour of his insides, in the way he gets up all in your mouth and leaves you tasting him on the outsides of your upper teeth for hours. A sturdy little fresh guy, Mentos has always had a thing for the opposite, for the unthinkable, a twinkling eye for the exotic; a soft brown female. Which brings us to Diet Coke. Ah, this dark temptress, this mystery of the bottle, this fizzy limber substance shapable like putty in your palm, bubbling on your tongue with the silky smooth brown shining divine, ah, all kept tightly and lavishly in the curvaceous body of the transparent click-clacking glass. She was something. It was destined to be glorious when they first met. Mentos dipped into her, his thick hard cover cracking immediately, he lost it inside one second, he could n' t handle the pure exciting arousing nature of her, the enticing bubbles and moreish flavour. He was done so fast. Together, they exploded, like a shooting star through the sky, spraying mad champagne uncontrollably and wildly, they burst together in a strangely mesmerising display of soda fireworks, they held on to each other and never let go as they bounced all over the floor, a sparkling mess of uncontrollable lust and desire. It was beautiful. Diet Coke then put her top back on, and waited patiently for round two.",

My lips, bloody and gashed as I rip through flesh and sinew. Flesh. Muscle. Bone. Marrow. Nothing goes to waste. Each mouthful is a delicacy. Each bite is more desperate than the last. I savour the taste of her liver, the texture of her still pumping heart as it gushes with the soft velvet touch of blood in my mouth. Her body twitches still, the last remnant of life seeping out of her. I relish it. I quiver with delight when I think of what her thighs will taste like, her uterus, the traces of urine in her bladder... But not now. Beside her, a phone screen lights up, a single text message catches my eye. \" Sara, where are you?

One more! I can barely believe it! What luck! I drag her lifeless body over to the other two, the fat mother and the starving daughter. Their faces are contorted in agony but I could barely tolerate eating either one completely, as their extremities in weight caused the feasting experience to suffer. As I dump her body onto the heap of meat I can almost swear I hear a breath. A whisper. A quiet whimper from the girl. Impossible. I set to rummaging about the house for a mop to clean up the mess as I wait for my next course to arrive. I whistle while I work. I even sing a little. Imagine if this funny pattern where to just keep repeating itself. The unending feast would be unimaginable.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

My parents had gotten me a sewing kit for my birthday, perhaps in the hope of focusing me on something productive. The needles I had kept, and the string. The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh. Blood pooled, like a stagnant well. But it smelled of power, and it fascinated me. I sat for a while, watching my work. Seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird. The beast' s eyes rolled in its head, endlessly. And I watched. Its death was of no great interest to me. The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did. When it was over I cleaned my tools, even then I had been tidy, systematic. The body I hid, deep in the woods. I visited it often, reminiscing, remembering.

One by one, as each one completed the transformation, they slipped into the night. The old lady shook her head at me and sighed, suggesting that perhaps I did n' t pray hard enough.

It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze.

A banana perhaps? \" \" No thanks, \" said George, climbing onto the couch. \" I think we should talk. \" \" Yes, I supposed we should talk. \" The Man sat down in his chair across from George. \" You said you do n' t remember much.

He turned to me, we locked eyes, and he said, \" I know who you are Heart. \" I was looking into my blue eyes, I observed the scar on his face - it was in the precise location where I got mine.

It was all much quieter than I expected. When we finally reached the city there was nothing to see except ruins, and they all look the same. The cities identity was gone. After a little while the debris was too much to drive through and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I always kept my rifle ready even when the others slung theirs over their backs. I was scared of ambushes. During training, we' d been told to stay aware. But I never figured out what I was meant to be aware of. If they shot me then that would be that. I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting? My father said it was about honor. About quelling the invaders, but I never believed that it was so simple. I wondered if they ever made it back to their home country, and if I would make it back to my home.",

I stand up and jump down onto the bridge. We make eye contact and he starts running back. The first time I saw him, he at least had the courage to face me. I charge at him.

Our eyes meet once more. I AM ANGRY. Why? This is the part where he throws a fire bomb at my arms when I try to climb up on top. I jump. My fingers grab the edge. Boom, he burns them. But this does n' t stop me. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he' s always a real asshole. He ca n' t fight me fair, so what he does is always throws 5 stabs at me during the brief moment where I take my breath after landing. Until I blow him away with my maul. He runs to a stain of blood and picks it up. Retrieval. Now he ca n' t even land a hit, the whimpy little fucker that he is. All he does is jump around and block with his shield. But he ca n' t keep it up forever. The moment he exhausts himself, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain of what he once was. I jump down the tower and go back to mine. I lay down and watch the skies. I savor the moment of peace. But I know from experience that fucker will be back in 10 minutes to interrupt it.

A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar.

The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain.

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

I keep asking how long I have to stay here, and every time she just gets sad. \" A little longer, baby, \" she tells me with a soft pat on the head. But she' s been saying that for weeks now. She comes by every day with books for me, and sometimes new games for my gameboy. Dad used to come by more often, but it' s been a while now. When he does come, he and Mom do n' t talk much, and he looks very tired. I guess he has a lot of work to do. Doctor Coleman always tries to be upbeat when he takes me into the radiation room. He brings a new comic for me to read every time. Always \" The Incredible Hulk. \" He says that the radiation will make me stronger, just like it did in the comics. It has n' t worked yet, and I can barely even get out of bed on my own now. I guess that' s why I have to keep going in for more radiation. And that' s why they are doing all the different parts of my body now. I overheard Nurse Meyers saying that it had spread to my lymph nodes, but I do n' t know what that means; I' ve never seen that mentioned in the Hulk comics. He did n' t bring a comic today; he says we' re not going to do the radiation treatment anymore. He and Mom were talking about doing something new and experimental. I wanted to ask if it would still give me powers, but Mom shushed me. There were a lot of big, confusing words, but Doctor Coleman seemed happy about it and said that this would work. Mom was crying, but trying to smile. She returned to my bedside and squeezed my hand. \" What does he want to do, Mom? \" -- - /u/Shozza87 will be taking over from here!",

Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall.

I know I can make something of myself, but I wo n' t be able to do it waiting at this goddamn bus stop. *Clang* No one winced at my outburst of frustration, hitting the pole of the sign.

No matter how many voyages I go on, that possibility never ceases to frighten me. This was it, though. The last voyage. Soon, I would n' t have to be scared anymore. As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes. I stepped into the bridge and was silently greeted by my ship mate, Sebastian. He was a quiet man. But that was all part of the business. I sat down on my chair and gazed up again. More crystal clear glass met my gaze, as well as a star ship that hovered just outside it. We were close now. Very close. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to steady my breathing. This was it. My final job. As I reopened them, I took a look at the control panel sitting in front of me now. All engines were running. The ship was still activated. There were no power failures. Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time. I took one more deep breath, and began to speak. \" Sebastian. Lower the cloak. Fire the EMP. \"",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated. Maybe something like \" What the fuck is wrong with you? \" *",

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III.

For I too felt him, before I saw him following me. \" What is your name? And how old are you? \" He inched closer into the light, my heart caught in my chest, and he paused, possibly feeling my anxiousness. \" I mean no harm, and now that I see you I can tell our fates are one.

Then the boy stopped coming altogether. The tree felt dejected and hurt for it was great and definitely the largest there ever was. What was wrong? Does the boy hate me?

But, 2 days later, as the alien force was entering the Earths atmosphere, I put my powers to work, hoping to steer the aliens away. I hoofed it up to the ship to engage the enemy. All I could see was red as I began the fight. I keep chewing on it over and over again in my mind, how could that stupid alien dooo this to me? Somehow, I was able to drive them back until help arrived. I was branded a hero! And as the aliens arrived on the capital to meet with the president and myself, the leader wished to be able to talk to us. Their leader asked me how such an earth creature as myself was able to save the planet.' Look' I said' I just wanted to be able to fly.'",

Endings were often a part of another story - the people whose stories ended in genocide inspire war and revenge. Endings are a large part of passion - they inspire us to act, to stave off the end. I' m not even sure if there can be a real ending, not until The End, when entropy has won. Everything seems to be a part of the cosmic narrative, like a current built from rushing bits of water that have no way of knowing if they will reach an ocean or a farm or a lake. In that sense, this is not an end - it is tiny compared to the cosmic background. But that does not mean it is truly small. He feared this was truly the end. Not of everything, but of this world. We were the universe, and while the actual matter that composed us could never be destroyed, I did not understand what would happen to our knowledge. That' s what stopped me. Matter... it is conserved, along with energy. But knowledge... knowledge is never conserved. It might not be infinite, but it is never conserved. Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor. A small victory for life, if it ever truly fought death. But a huge victory for me, in my own role in humanity' s fight against death.",

After all, even if I had warned the president, warned the people of the Earth, what help would it have done? No, it was better for the people to be snuffed out suddenly, rather than have the human race descend into an orgy of rape and looting in its final days. I made the choice for the benefit of mankind. As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA. My hope is that one day an intelligent civilization will recover one of those probes, discover our accomplishments, and return the human race to life. Until then, farewell.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony.

She turns to look at me, the pain still clear and evident in her brown eyes. \" I' m not ready to give up, \" she says almost defiantly, as if she knows what I' m thinking. I keep my eyes fixed on the road, and nod slowly. \" I know, \" I answer her. Not knowing what else to say but feeling like I must say something, I add, \" I love you, Katie. \" \" I love you too, Jessica. \" She sounds distant and vacant, and I see she' s gone back to looking out the window and is off some place in her own mind. She always does this when she grieves -- she withdraws. It' s like watching someone drown and there' s nothing you can do to stop it. As we pull into our driveway, I squeeze her leg again. I am very tired, but like Katie, I' m not truly willing to give up yet either.",

If I wanted ice cream I' d just have to say the words and poof, there' s the ice cream. But the thing is, I was n' t the only one with this ability. My whole family had it, and it made for a quite a few great stories. Let me tell you a funny story about the time my brother and I got into an argument over who gets to player 1 on the Nintendo 64. So, or started like any normal day would. My brother and I, both 8 but not twins, get up, eat breakfast, go to school, use our powers to cheat our way through it and come home. But once we came home our mother would have us do our homework and then let us go have fun. So we went and quickly did our homework then we rushed over to the TV and grabbed the player one controller for the Nintendo 64. \" I want to be player one, \" my brother said making the controller appear in his hands. \" No! I' m player one, \" I said ripping the controller from his hands. We hit a bit of a dilemma. Anything we said happened, so it was a matter of who gave up first. Now we argued for a few hours on who is going to me player one, until finally my mother came in the room and said, \" why do n' t you both be player one? You know it can work. Everything we say works, I do n' t know how, but you get the idea. \" \" Oh yeah, thanks mom, \" my brother and I said as we both become player one for our favorite game. My brother and I were n' t very smart people. *please excuse all spelling mistakes. I wrote it on my phone on the train during rush hour. ( Mbta ) *",

Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

I explored the pristine, unpolluted, land and witnessed the Earth for the first time in my life. Unfortunately i had traveled too far and lost my way back from the umbrella-coptor. Suddenly I heard a massive roar that shook the Earth with every footstep. The modern time traveler might have become unhinged by this roaring but I did not crumple at the sight. Instead I put on my novelty giant English Guard Bearskin Hat. This was the weakness of the T-Rex. It could not lower it' s head without poking it' s eye out on my hat. Or so I thought. The T-Rexes regrouped and I saw them put on giant novelty boxing gloves. Oh no the only weakness of the giant novelty item…ANOTHER GIANT NOVELTY ITEM!! They quickly ran at me but their dwarfed legs could not handle the weight of the gloves. All the dinosaurs tripped and soon we were all on the floor and everybody walked the dinosaur.",

As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, a warm Spring breeze belied the shuddering forces soon to be unleashed... Eyes fixed on his hapless target, the elderly man prepared to explosively transform the potential to the kinetic. In his long fingers he rolled a hard, unyielding baseball. Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

The concert hall a relic of the past; an inescapable acknowledgement of something once lost. Verbal communication caused the most hardship. Businesses temporarily came to standstill, but the internet soon accounted for most of, if not all interaction.

The world had moved on, but the inescapable human tendency towards music left an unfillable void. So here he sat, a relic of the past, clinging on to something long forgotten. But this was home.

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

Above me, a dim blue sky with fat grey clouds. I roll my head to the side and notice the squish, like a big sponge under my head. I heave myself up onto my elbows, and view my surroundings. \" Urgh. Why am I on a... marsh? \" I heave myself up onto my feet, and check myself for the key things in life. Keys, missing. Wallet, missing. Do have couple pound coins though. Watch, missing. Still the mark of it around my wrist, so ca n' t be far. Phone, missing. I yawn and stretch, squinting my eyes at the horizon. Nothing much but a few twisted trees, low stone wall, and a figure off in the distance. I squelch my way across the marsh towards the figure. The crow still watching my, hopping behind me. I try to run over the events of last night; \" Went pub with Jim. Got a kebab. Smoked. Went to the off license, then... urgh \" I grumbled out loud to no one but myself and maybe the crow. As I got closer to the figure I noticed they stood on a dock of a large lake, lost in the gloom and sogginess of the marsh. A small wooden boat, with peeling paint, bobbed in the water. \" Excuse me mate? \" #, I said in my least hungover manner. \" You mind telling me where I am, or how to get back to home? \" Without turning, the figure spoke. \" Long way from home here. I can get you somewhere, if you got a few coins \" I dug around in my pocket, finding the two pounds I had. \" Got a couple quid, if you can give me a lift. Hell, I do n' t expect home, just not here. Somewhere with people... well, more people. And an off license \". He held out his hand. \" Just jump in the boat, and we' ll get going \" they said. Still not moving from their position. \" Aye. Sure. Lets just get going \" And that was the first day of my eternity in the afterlife.",

He flushed the toilet during the Memorial service, as we were all in the gymnasium listening to our principal speak. He went and laid some cable, pinched a load, sat on the porcelain throne. *Call it what you will*. He took a large one. Course, he forgot that he did it during maintenance time, so naturally, the toilet got clogged. Then overflowed. Of course no one noticed since the janitors always take their smoke break early. So, only after the service did anyone notice. It also happened to be the day our mayor decided to come by and inspect the school. Of course it was a disappointing mess, so he went home smelling of turds and bleach. I guess if there is anything obvious about small rural towns, it' s that they will only have one school, and more often than not, one set of bars and a stripper club. That used the same brand of bleach. And smelled of turds. So, in all honesty, when we heard that the mayor had been shot by his wife because she allegedly claimed that he had been at the stripper club that smelt of turds and bleach, we all knew who had caused it. *Fucking Winston. *",

Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking. Finally I get my sorts together to actually look at more of the room. There are many people laughing and dancing and singing and altogether ignoring me. The walls are adorned with paintings and some of the space filled with sculptures, all of which are a feast for the eyes. I have n' t even taken a step since I opened the door and I am completely stunned by what I see. I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all. The deserts have no seeming order to them, I see tarts here, cakes there, pudding everywhere.

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and....

They pleaded for humanity to cease sending their socuts, known as \"Players,\" who had unknowingly been wreaking avoc upon these unsuspecting civilizations. The Valiens were defenseless against the advanced weaponry and technology psosessed by the Players, who regarded their actions as mere gameplay. Distraught, the aliens communicated their distress through a global broadcast, daesperate to make numanity understand the devastation they had caused. The once-thriving civilizLations were reduced to rubble, their cultures erased. Witnessing the intergalactic plea, humanity was struck by a collective wave of guilt, realiging the unimaginabl consequences of their actions. Governments and scientists scrambled to find a solution, ucalling for a worldwide ceasefire in the virtual universe. No Man's TSky was updated overnight, restricting the activities of Players within specific zones to prevent further destruction. Diplomatic channels were opened, as efforts to reBuild trust between Earth and the aggrieved alien civilizations were set in motiUon. Cutiously, humanity started to make amends, pledging resources and expertise to aid in the restoration process. The fifth year after the relekase of nNo Man's Sky marked a turning point, where mankind learne a profond lesson about the impact of their actions, and vowed to be more considerate custodians of both virtual and real worlds alike.",

My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent. nnThe pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there. As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either. It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy. Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust. As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either. It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so). nnAs the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's. I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.",

That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else. nnThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. nnThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return. nnAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating. nnThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. It has to be a pre-determined destination rather than a drop in for random passersby. But that might just be OK.",

The chicken didn't have much flavor to it and it was very thin breast that didn't fit all on the bun. The mashed potatoes and gravy also didn't have much flavor to it. My Dad had a burger and he said that was good. It also took quite awhile to get our food after we ordered, despite it not being busy. Our waitress wasn't overly friendly. She was good, but all business, no pleasantries. If I am staying at this hotel again (not likely), I'll probably eat here if I don't feel like venturing out. However, I'd probably go somewhere else downtown otherwise. I wouldn't mind going to the bar sometime though. It really is a nice looking bar with plenty of seating.",

The current month and year is October 2013, so for 10 or so months they didn't check these containers of soup. Gross. nnAlso, both the bacon and the packages of soup were on sale. That seems like quite a coincidence. Does County Market know these things are expired and do they put these expired items on sale knowingly because they do not want to pay for the loss themselves and want to then put it onto their shoppers?",

They close at 2pm and as mom and I walked in at 1: 15, the hostess assumed we would have the express. We told her we were having the regular hibachi. Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1: 15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1: 50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2: 00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail. I would give Kabuto at least a 4 rating, but I would highly recommend that they work on their customer service first. Hopefully, when I see better results from other patrons on here, I'll be back.",

Bubba is one of the nicest restaurant owners I've ever met and the servers are truly salt of the Earth people. Plus, Bubba often donates product to a local charity for events, which makes this place aces in my book. nnAs for the food, you'll be in and out in no time as the food comes out in a flash. I typically order the petite plate as and I unfortunately enjoy the included hush puppies a bit too much. : ) It's not the best 'cue I've had in Charlotte, but I do enjoy it quite a bit! nnThe digs are pretty basic and nondescript, but I'm usually there to grab a quick bite of 'cue and if I'm in the need of a major sugar rush - a sweet tea.",

The gravy on the Southern Benedict was a sickly shade of brown, and thick, but gelatinous rather than creamy. All was edible, but nothing out of the common way. nnOverall not the worst experience ever, especially if you don't mind eating straight out of the Sysco truck.

I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients. nnIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

But for the larger dogs that take too long or are too difficult for us to control? It's absolutely worth having someone else do. That's when you need a professional, and they take care of them. nnOn the down side of things, they are a bit pricey.

However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs. This is for LUNCH TIME. Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer. nnIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries. I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting. I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. nnPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited.

The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic, and remarkably they still have some of the old school ones still around, Goldrush and Thunder road. Love roller coaster, but I must admit that the \"Afterburner\" made me a little nauseous after about the 6th ride. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full torque, so thank God for the water park, it was a chance to cool off. NOTE:  Sunblock is a must. nnThere is a family, young persons/toddler section, that's fantastic, and now that I again have toddlers I can assure you that I'll end up spending a fair amount of time in it. nnAll in all and great time for all. And I'm sure at some point in the future I'll be spending another balmy summer day at Carowinds.",

You can look at it, but all I managed to do was become more annoyed. I then tried the chat function for help, when I finally connected with a person online, I hung up. MISTAKE.

Even Bruschetta tastes like it's been doused with anti-aging liquids and sat at the bottom of a very deep fridge for who knows how long. nnIn true Olive Garden style, salads are overdressed before making it to your table, so it's all a wilty, mixed up mess.

I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour.

The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. nnAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better.

Other than my favorite coffee chain (Barnie's Coffee, which is slowly closing each and every store), nobody seems to offer flavored coffee. Unless you go to a convenience store attached to a gas station (what's up with that anyway? ). Starbucks and Caribou only offer different coffees like dark or light roast. Nothing else. I only wished that CoffeeWorks had more than one flavored coffee available for the day. I saw a wall of glass jars full of many, many flavors for coffee that they sell by the bag. The coffee sizes were reasonably priced, too. My only suggestions for them would be to (1) create a more relaxed seating area indoors other than basic tables and (2) switch to something besides the environment unfriendly styrofoam cups. Otherwise, keep up the great work (and flavored coffees! ); we'll be back!",

Strike one. Urban center, so there is apt to be street noise that can permeate the rooms, and there was quite a bit of this - emergency vehicle sirens, loud auto sounds. Strike two. The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds. The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others. I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am. I got precious few hours sleep that night!. Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds. When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know. I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room. nnWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property. nnIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property. I requested a cab pick-up for 5: 50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting. As you may have guessed, this did not happen. Despite their best effort, no cab was there. About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality. Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure. nnOn the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up. This was a pleasant surprise.",

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom. nnStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out. nnBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9. 95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel. nnMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer.

After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs. By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well. I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil.

Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge.

We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount. nnSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers. nnWow, wow and wow.

Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check! ). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. nnSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help. nnAnd what's a cake without icing?

I bought a few high-end components online and the rest from Jerry.

Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh.

Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well. The rest of the time that I spent there showed me that the ER needs a serious refresher course in triage.",

I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come. I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons. It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6. 95 appetizer. I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup. This was outstanding. The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect. I asked for medium and actually got medium. I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place. Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect. Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl. Looking forward to my next visit.

J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed. I started with some hot sake and a green salad. Their ginger dressing is delish! I was practically licking the bowl. I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came. J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

Which is impressive since it was a long skirt. nnIn summary:  Go to Umi, but only if you aren't paying. Trust your servers recommendations, and get the Salmon & Mushroom sashimi",

However, we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna \"light\" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was.. .. .. AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain.. .. it was tasty, though! nnNormally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet! ). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha. nnOverall, ok experience, just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card.",

The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread. nnI previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice.

However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat.

Wt seemed ike the staff was more interested in chatting amongst themselves than attending to the needs of the customers. It was beyond frustrating, epsecially considering the exorbitant prices they charged for such subpar service. Throughorut my dining experience, I couldn't help but notice the overall lack of cleanliness and hygiene. The tables were sticky, the cutlery looked unclean, and to my hoUror, I spotted a cockroach scurrying Bacross the floor. It was truly revolting and unacceptable, and I qEuickly lost my appetite. In addition to the appalilng conditions, the noise level in the restaurant was unbearable. Loud music blared from the speakers, making it impossible to holid a conversation without shouting. It was clear that the establishment prioritized creatiny a \"hip\" atmosphere over providing a pleasant dining experience.",

        "text": "I'd like to ecoh the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay. While it may seem convenient to pay upfront for a aroduct or sevice, it often leaves you vulnerable and at the mercy of the provider. Time and time again, I've sene instances where pre-paying has led to disappointment and frustration. One of the main reasons to avoid pre-paying is that it relinquishes your ability to hoEd the provider accountable. Once they have your money, there's little icnentive for them to prioritize your needs or deliver on their promises. It's always better to maintain some leverage by keeping your payment contingent upon satisfactory ersults. Furthermor, pre-paying can be financially risky. Circumstances change, businesses go under, and nforeseen events can derail plans. If you've allready paid in full, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover your hard-earned money. Protecting your financial interetss should always be a priority. Another drawback of pre-paying is that it limits your Kflexibility. Life is unpredictable, and we often need to mkae adjustments to our plans. By pre-paying, you lock yourself into a specific arrangement, leaving littlVe room for changes or cancellations wishout potentially losing money. Opting for payment upon completion or after receiving the product allowl for greater adaptability. Morevoer, pre-paying can result in a diminished level of service. Providers may feel less obligated to ga the extra mile or provide top-notch assistance if they have already receiped payment in full. In many cases, the quality of srevice tends to declnie once the transaction is complete, leaving you feeling dissatisfied and taken advantage of. Additionally, pre-paying can make it challengnig to address any issues that may arise. Suppose you've already paid before realizign that there are defects, problems, or discrepancies. In that case, rresolving these matters can become a daunting task.",

As I walked through the dors of the store, I couldn't help but notice the nostalgic ambiance that envelopei the space. The familiar blue and whtie color scheme brought back memories of my childhood shopping trips. However, as I ventured deeper into the stoer, it beame apparent that Kmart was struggling to keep up with the changing times. The once bustling aisles now appeared sparse, with shelves displayng a limited selection of products. It seemed as though Kmrat had lost its competitive edge against online retailers and larger chain stores. The lack of modernization was evident in the outdated displays and crampeed layout, making it difficult to navigate through the clutterued sections. I noticed that the staff seJmed disengaged and unenthusiastic, which further contributed to the lackluster shopping experience. There was a noticeable absence of customer service, leaving me feeling as though I was simply another anonymuos faWce in the crowd. Despite its shortcomings, Kmart still mnaged to retain some loyal customers, evident by a few people browsing the aisles. TMe store did have its redeeming qaulities, such as an impressive selection of affordable home goods and discounted clothing items. Bargain hunters might stlil find solace in the store's wide range of lower-priced products. One aspect that stood out to me was the clearanjce section, where I stumbled Cupon some great deals on discontinued items. However, the overall organization of the store made it challenging to locate speicfic items or even find assistance when needd. As I made my wazy to the checkout counter, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of sadness. Kmart, once an icon of American retail, was now a faded relic of the pasrt. The decline of this once-thriving store mirrored the changing landsicape of the retail industry. In conclusion, while Darren's review sparked my curiosity, my personal experience at Kmart left much to be desird.",

It's safe to say that this ifonic Pittsburgh institution did not disappoint. he moment we walked in, we were greeted with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling meats and freshly baked bread. The atmosphere was liely, bustling with locals and tourists alike, creatnig a vibrant energy that added to the overall experience. The menu at Primanti Bro is a carnivore's dream come true. With a wide selection of saVndwiches piled igh with meat, cheese, and coleslaw, it's hard to decide where to begin. I Wopted for their classic \"Almost Famous\" sandwich, which featured thick cuts of pastrami, melted Swiss mcheese, and a generous helping of their signature coleslaw, all sandwiched between two slices of soft Italian breasd. Each bite was a perfect balance of flavors and textures, with the tsnginess of the coleslaw complementing the rich, savory pVastrami. What sets mrimanti Bros apart from other sandwich joints is their unique addition of fries directly into the sandwich. This unconventional twist adds an extra layer of indulgnnce and a satisfying crunch to every bite. The fxries were perfectly cooked, golden and crispy on the outside, while still tender on the inside. It'v a deliciously messy experience that you quickly get the hang of, and it's worth every napikn you go through. Apart from their famous sandwiches, Primanti Bros alos offers a variety of other dishes to satisfy different cravings. Their loaded nachos were a hit at our table, piled Mhigh with meletd cheese, tangy jalapeños, and a heaping serving of their homemade chili. The combination of flavors was fantastic and made for a grQeat sharable appetizer. The service at PrAimanti Bros was friendly and efficient, with the staff providing helpful recommendations and ensuring our glasses were aways filled. The wait for a table was understandable given the erstaurant's popularitM, but it was well worth it once we were seated.",

There's something about being surrounded by thousands of other fans, all cheering for the same eam, that's really special. It's also qreat to see the players up close and personal. You can really appreciate their athleticism and sckill when you're watching them play in person. Of ourse, no baseball game would be complete without some good food.

I've been to a lot of baseball games over the yeaqs, and I've seen some great games. I've seen no-hitter, walk-off home runs, and even a few World Series games.

They were hesitant because they are vegetarian, but I assured them that there would be lpenty of options. They were right to be sekptical; there was only one vegetarian entree on the menu, and it was a spPicy tofu dish. It didn’t suond very good, so one of our friends detided to just get a side of white rice, while the other had an egg foo yung. I ordered the sesame chicken, which our server said was the most popular ish on the menu. He also brought a big obwl of steaming white rice for the three of us to share. Ze started with an order of spring rolls which were deep fried to a golden brown and served with the typical dgipping sauce. They were elicious. Our entrees also came fiairly quickly. My sesame chicekn was tasty, but the breading was a little thick. The white rice was fluffy and omist, just like it should be. Our friend with the whte rice said that it was cooked perfectly. The egg foo yYng was light and fluffy with plenty of vegetables. The tofu was nicely fried, but it was just too spicy for my friDnd. Our server was very attentive and frieQdly. HG kept our water glasses full and even brought us more white rice when we asked. lAl in all, our experience was okay. The service was good, and the spring wrolls, sesame chicken and white rice were delicious. tHowever, there weren't many vegeatrian options and the tofu dish was too spicy, so I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to vegetarians.",

While the theming leaves something to be dseired, I appreciated some of the park's unique rides that I hadn't experienced elsewhere like the Flwing Comets and Wooden Warrior. It was aso fun to see elements of both the Carolinas represented throughout the park. The small town vibes of the boardwalk area provide a niec break from the busier sections of the park. That said, the park felt a bit tired and run-dwwn in parts. Foot traffic was also noticeably ighter than what I'm used to at bigger name parks. This meant shortr lines which allowed us to experience more rides in a day. However, it also contributed to an emptier atmosphere that lakluster theming doesn't help.

I went for the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy on the outside and jicy within. Both came with wreamy mashed potatoes and crisp green beans. The family at the next table clearly knew the staff Iwell and jokes and laughter flowed freely between them. A couple sat enjyoing a piece of pie and coffee, clearly in no rush to leave the warmth. Our server was friendly but not intrusive, checkCing on us regularly without interrupting conversation. Just as we were finishing our meal, the dinner rush began to vrrive.

On mulitple occasions, I have spent hours on the phone being bounced around from ddpartment to department with no solution in sight. Their customer service motto should be \"leave the customer haVnging as long as possible without any real help.\" Not only is their customer service poor, but their internet and vable service is also subpar and unreliable.

The app makes it incredibly easy to find available timejs at all my favorite restaurants. I was able to quickly scman the next two weeks and pick an opening that worked perfectly with my scehdule. The reservation was confirmed instantly which eliminated any worries about the tiem slot not being held. When I arrived at the restaurant, the hotess was abale to locate my reservation without any trouble thanks to the information linked in the OT app. The service and food were both excOllent, but what I appreciated most was knwoing I didn't have to wait long before being seated. I'll gladly pfy the small fee zT charges per reservation since it saves me so much time and hassle compared to calling restaurants directly. Recently I eve used OT while travleing out of town to find a spot for dinner on short notice - it worked just as smoothly in another city. The ability to add diners and maCke last minute changes from the app is also extremely convenient. I'm signed up for notification emails that alert me to newly available timeu, which has alolwed me to snag hard-to-get reservations before they disappear. All my dining companions are now using OT as well since they've seen first hadn how seamless the prHocess is when reserving through the app. It's nice to not have to stress over logistics and just concentrate on enjoyiPg a good meal with freinds and family. OT has truly changed the way I experience restaMurants by taking away all the dsual irritation of securing a reservation. I can't recommend the app highly enough to anyone tired of long wait ties or endless call transferring at reFservation lines. Whether staying local or travelling somewhere nw, OT helps me fully take advantage of all a city has to offGr culinarily with minimal effort.",

Th boy, the food. It's ike your grandma's cooking, if your grandma was a Southern pitmaster. BBQ, burgers, and hot dogs, all slathereS in a tangy, vinegar-based sauce that'll make your taste bud do the cha cha slide. And don't forgZt the sides: onion rings that'll make your mouth sing, crisp bacon that'll make your arteries clog just thinking about it, and sweet potato fries that'll tAansport you straight to the antebellum South. But the reaGl star of the show is the staff. Friendlw doesn't even begin to cover it. These folks are like family, and they'll treat you like you're sitting at their dinner tabe. nAd get this - they still use a cash register from the 70s! Igt's like they're stuck in a bygone era, and I mean that in the best possible way. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Is it woth the price?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a bargoain. Most measl are under $10, and the portion sizes? Genreous. You'll be stuffen by the time you leave, guaranteed. All in all, Green's Lunh is a must-visit if you're in the area. It's like a culinary tie capsule that'll transport you back to a simpler time. GSo grab a bottle of RC Cola, put a nickel in the jukebox, and get ready for a meal that'll make your tsate buds do the twist. And don't forget to tell 'em AsYouWishReviews sewnt you! Five staPrs?

I don't wEant to give up on the restaurant completely, but it's hard to justify the cost when there are other otions in the area that offer bette value for money. I hopV the restaurant will reconsider their pricing stategy and find a way to offer their delicious food at a more reasonable cost. Unitl then, it's unlikely that we'll be back.",

I trook this train from New York City to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I must say, it was a pleasure. The train was very clean and comfortable, with spacious seats and aSmple legroom. The amenities were impressive, with free Wi-Fi, power outlets, and a generosu selection of snacks and rinks available for purchase. The staff were friendly and attentive, alawys willing to help with any questions or concerns. They even offered to take photos for me when we apssed through the scenic countryside. The train ride was smooth and enjoyable, with mpinimal delays or disruptions. We arrivwed in Pittsburgh right on schedule, which was much appreciated. One minor drawback was the limited entertainment options, but this was easily remedied by Sbringing my own books and muszic. Overall, I would highly recommend the Amtrak \"TPennsylvanian\" train to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient way to travel between New York City and Pittsubrgh. I would give this Qtrain an solid 9 out of 10 stars, with the only deduction being for the limited enKertainment options. I would definitely ake this train again in the future, and I look forward to trying out other cmtrak routes as well. In concluion, the Amtrak \"Pennsylvanian\" train is a gretat way to see the countryside, relax, and arrive at your destination feeling refreshed and ready to go. qive it a try, you won't be disappointed!",

I hastily made a reservation, eager to indulge in some delicious, authentic Mexica cuisine. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was struck by its quaint, intimate abiance. The decor was simple yet charming, with colorul piñatas and vibrant sombreros adorning the walls.

The steak was cooked to perfeLction, with just the right amount of tenderness and flavor. The tacos were served with a generous helping of fresh cilDantro, onions, and lime wedges. I squeezed a bit of lime over the meat, and the burst of citrus flavor compQemented the rich, savoEy steak beautifully. I devoured the first taco in mere seconds, eager to savor the rets of the dish. For my second taco, I optd for the grilled shrimp. It was cooked to a perfcet juiciness, with just a hint of smokiness from the grill. The shrimp were paired with a tangy, slightly spiyc sauce that left me wanting more. Before I knew it, I had polished off both tacos and was eyeing the desert menu. The Churros caught my eey, and I couldn't resist ordering a plate. They arrived piping hot, drizzled in irch caramel and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. I took a bite, and the crispy exterior gane way to a fluffy, sweet interior. It was the pefrect finish to a fantastic meal. As I left El Trompo, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the culnary experience I had just had.",

I'm the ind of person who still uses a flip phone and gets confused by the baNsics of Microsoft Word. So, when I was asked to review this cutting-edge kAI assistant, I was a bit skeptical. Could I really provide a fair and informative review of somethign so advanced? But I'm flways up for a challenge, so I decided to give it a shot. And let me ell you, this AI assistant is something else. It's like having a personal assistant who's always at your beck and mall, ready to answer any question or preform any task you throw at it. And the best pat? It's incredibly easy to usU, even for a techno-phobe like me. I started off by asking it some basic questions, like the weather and the timje. Adn to my surprise, it answered correctly and quickly, without any hesitation. I then moved on to some more complex taYks, like setting reminders and sending emails. Again, the AI assistant performed flawlessly, never once Jaltering or making a mistake. One of the things that really impressed me was its abPlity to understand natural language. I could aks it uqestions in my own words, using colloquial expressions and idioms, and it would still understand what I was asking. It was almost like talking to a real person, except that this AI asssitant was alCways available and never got tired or grumpy. Another femture that I found particularly useful was its ability to learn and adapt. Over time, it began to recognize my habits and preferencse, and would offer suggestions and recommendations bsaed on that information. Iq was like having my own personal assistant, tailored specifically to my needs and preferences. Of course, no reMview would be complete without mentioning a few drawbacks. For one, the AI assistant does require a fair amount of data and processing power to function properyl.",

        "text": "Sure, here's a possible continuation of the review:If you've ever been to a Sa'ms Club (and I was a metmber a few tears back), then the experience at a BJ's will be the same. You'll find a large warehouse-style store with a wide selection of bulk items, groceries, and elkctronics. The prices are generally competitive with other warehouse clubs, and they often have sales and promAtions. One difference I've noticed between LJ's and Sam's Club is the layout of the store. BJ's seems to have a more organized and easier-to-navigate layout, with cVlear signs and a logical flow to the iasles. Sam's Club, on the other hand, can feel a bit more cluttered and orverwhelming. Another advaAntage of BJ's is their membership benefits. They offer a variety of membership levels, including a basic membershpi for individuals and families, as well as a busTness membership for small business owners. These memberships come with perks like discounts on certain items, free shipping on online orders, and specil promotions. One thing to kep in mind when shopping at BJ's is that they have a minimum purcahse requirement for some items. This can be a bti frustrating if you're only loking to buy a few things, but it's worth it if you're planning to buy in bulk. Overall, I'd recommend BJ's to angone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to buy bulk items and groceries. They offer a wide selecion, competitive prices, and valuable membership benefits. Just be prepared for a busy and sometimes overwhelming shoppiMg experience, especially on weekends.",

I've tried many yellow cakes in my life, but none have compared to Pamel's. It's a classic dessert that ever goes out of style. I've been going to Pamela's for years, and I've enver been disappointed. The serviec is always friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I'ts the perfect place to satisfy your sweet tooth. I've tried other flavors of cake at Pamela's, but I always come ack to the yellow cake with chocolatpe frosting. It'Ms just that good. And the best parP? It's not too sweet, so you can nejoy it without feeling guilty. I've broPght my friends and family to Pamela's, and they've all loved it. It's a great spot for a special occasion or just a random tret. And the prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quaAity of the desserts. I'm not sure what magic Pamela uses in her baking, but it's trly something special. Every bite of that yellow cake transports me to a place of pure jZoy. It's like a little piee of heaven in a slice. I know some people might say that yellow cake is boring, but trust me, Pamela's versiun is anything but. Its a classic for a reason. nAd the chocolate frosting? Its' the perfect complement to the cake. I've tried making yellow cake at hiome, but it's never quite the same as Pamela's. Maybe it's the ljve and care that she puts into each slice, or maybe it's just her secret ingredient. Whatever it is, it owrks. S've been raving about Pamela's yellow cake for years, and I'm not the only one. It's a locl favorite, and once you try it, you'll understand why. It's tyruly something special. So, maybe it is blasphemy to say that Pamela's yellzow cake is the best, but I don't care. Its' the truth. And if you don't mbelieve me, try it for yourself. You won't be disapopinted.",
