TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison.

The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation.

The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

Our analysis revealed complex structures within each Ly-alpha nebula, including multiple peaks, wiring, and extended regions of emission. We found evidence of large-scale outflows and sturdy spatial variations in the Ly-alpha line widths, indicating the presence of exceedingly dynamic processes within the nebulae. These observations suggest that the Ly-alpha nebulae are likely powered by a combination of active galactic primaries (AGN) feedback, galactic-scale whirlwind, and star formation activity. Additionally, the Ly-alpha nebulae coins spatially correlated Ly-alpha and [O III] emission, depicting a connection between the ionized gas traced by Ly-alpha and the AGN deeds traced by [O III] emission.

In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a cloaked gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger masses scale. The pitched dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which eradication their masses.

Polyakov suggest an action which is proportional to the domain of the world sheet and a yardstick which is proportional to \\(exp(−S_P[X])\\), where \\(S_P\\) is the Polyakov action. This proposal, however, runs into difficulties when the string coupling derives strong. This is because the exponential of the Polyakov operation is large for large values of the string coupling, which makes the path integral ill-defined. One way to deal with this problem is to use a different action for the world leaves theory. another particularly interested alternative action is the sigma model measuring, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the determinant of the induced metric on the world sheet. The sigma model action has a number of strengths over the Polyakov action. First, it is well-defined for all values of the string links. Second, it is conformally invariant, which average that it is invariant under variants of the metric on the world sheet. Third, it is related to string field theory, which is a perturbative approach to stringing theory. In this paper, we will study the sigma schematics action in the tensionless limit.

In particular, charge order, in which the charge distribution explanatory a conventional pattern, is often considered as a precursor to superconductivity. The interplay between charge order and lattice distortion, renamed as electron-lattice coupling, is crucial to understanding the schemes of unconventional superconductivity. Orn this paper, we investigate the impact of electron-lattice coupling on charge order in $\\theta$-(ET)$_2$X, a quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor. We use a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental efforts to show that the electron-lattice couples leads to a significant enhancement of the costing order and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature.

We show that the amplitude of these distinctions scales predictably with the exomoon's physical trait including its mass, radius, and orbital parameters.

In other animals with similar anatomy, this requires the teeth to be replaced due to wear and tear.The team members said they can now begin testing this theory and others regarding the dinosaur's biology and behaviour.Follow Paul on Twitter.",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Willy Caballero, 35, has featured in the squad for Premier League and Champions League matches since 21 January.But Bravo was restored to the starting line-up for City's win against Hull last weekend.

Last week, Asda reported its worst quarterly performance on record.Sainsbury's saw sales fall 0.6% and Morrisons by 1.8%.Market researcher Nielsen, which has published industry data in the 12 weeks up to 13 August, found similar trends.It and Kantar noted that promotional sales had dropped, reflecting the big four supermarkets' move towards simpler pricing models and permanent price cuts.Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said the big four supermarkets were simplifying \"the overall customer offer in response to the growth of the discounters by lowering the level of promotions and reducing multi-buys, instead moving to permanent price cuts\".He added that the hot weather and success at Rio had helped boost overall supermarket sales.\"Brexit seems to have been replaced by an Olympic 'feel-good' factor among shoppers and there were more visits to buy food and drink in the last four weeks than this time last year.\"Nielsen said the strongest category performances were in soft drinks, with mineral water sales up by 18.5%. This was followed by frozen foods driven by ice-cream sales.Kantar said grocery price inflation remained negative, with a representative basket of goods 1.3% cheaper than it was last year.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,\" he said.Last month, a landslide at a rubbish dump in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killed at least 113 people.",

He also asked the undercover officer to procure more horns and send them to Hong Kong.Mr Wei, who was sharing a hotel room with Mr Li, later asked an undercover informant to take a fish and wildlife officer out for dinner and offer her money to help Mr Li, prosecutors said.Meanwhile, prosecutors say Mr Wang bought libation cups carved from rhino horn in the US and sent them to Mr Li in Hong Kong.Some believe drinking from intricately carved rhino horn cups brings good health, and the cups are highly prized by collectors, US authorities said.Native to Africa, the black rhinoceros is classified as a critically endangered species, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.But demand for rhino horns and the prices paid for them on the black market have soared in recent years, US prosecutors said.",

Like-for-like revenues rose 2.7%.Chief executive Jill McDonald said Halfords had gained market share in both motoring and cycling.\"Profit performance for the year was impacted by the weaker pound but our plans are well developed and I am confident this will be offset over time,\" she said.It is the last set of results to be presented by Ms McDonald before she joins Marks & Spencer as head of non-food in September.Chairman Dennis Millard said Ms McDonald was leaving a \"strong team and a clear direction to drive future growth\".Halfords said higher import costs had largely been responsible for the drop in profits.It said a late Easter knocked recent sales, revealing a 1.2% drop in like-for-like retail sales in the final three months of its financial year.Taking the 15 weeks to 28 April 2017, which includes Easter, it said like-for-like sales were 3.9% higher.Ms McDonald said the company was in a \"position of strength\" despite \"uncertainty\" about consumer spending due to rising inflation.Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the focus on premium cycling brands was working, buoyed by the fact Halfords expects growth in cycling of 3-5% per annum in the medium term.\"Looking ahead there are hopes that the retailer will actually benefit from the weak pound as more people stay in Britain for holidays.\"Staycations might help, as will the focus on higher value bikes.

About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face.

Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

Sometimes it' s easier to make claims so specific that there' s no way someone wo n' t call me on them, like last week, the mafia man who broke into my apartment and held me at gunpoint, I told him an asteroid was going to crush him in a minute if he did n' t leave. He smirked and asked my if my lying ass wanted to die. Those were, ironically, his last words. Being a hero is n' t always easy. Luckily, I do n' t always have to be one.

We had our own short, but vibrant history to learn and the long history of Earth was so confusing and had so many sides telling their own story. We Martians were much better, all recorded fairly and accurately so the truth was never in doubt. Firearms were, of course, completely unnecessary. The Earthlings had always had weapons because, even from the earliest days, in their pre-history, they had needed to defend themselves against savage neighbours. We were n' t savages, so we had never needed weapons. Disputes were resolved fairly, quickly and with the utmost consideration, after all, we are all Martians and all interested in the same goal, the prominence and wellbeing of the Mars colony. See, the thing is, I' m part of the original Mars colony. I was in the third resettling phase. These fifth phase resettlers are n' t.... quite like us. I heard from my neighbours that some of them were thieves, rapists and murderers. Sure, we have those things on the Mars colony, but these events are so rare as to be nearly non-existant. Surely nobody can blame me for having a firearm, right? It' s just self defence. I have a family after all, two girls, any father has a right to be protective. Is n' t that so? My neighbours are having their firearms made tomorrow, it' s just a safety measure. We' ve always had peace, this is just a precaution. Just a precaution.....

He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself. Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie' s car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I' d taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead. It was n' t the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me. The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I' d cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I' d made the last hour of many men' s lives slightly better. I could n' t imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make. Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up. Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work. -- - Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer' s cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face. He was crying. I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \" I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry. I really am. \" I turned and resumed walking away. Just before he was out of earshot, I glanced at him. \" So am I. \"",

In mere hours, we will see ICBMs cascade from the sky like fallen angels cast from Heaven; once our silent protectors in the form of mutually assured destruction, now our doomsday much like the betrayal of the rebel angel Lucifer. Tonight, we will see explosions glimmer through the land like shooting stars. Tonight, we will see our families evaporate into smoke before our very eyes. Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life. Still, we stand strong in the face of complete and assured death, not because we are too weak to retaliate, but because we' re strong enough not to. Our chapter is at its end. The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end. Are we really so vain to believe that just because a nation dies, all of mankind must perish? Are we really so arrogant to trust in our ideal of equality that the whole world must die? We' ve made our answers clear to the world. We hope it resonates and echoes in a new era so that mankind may truly understand what the end of the world mean and consequences it carries, so that some day in the future, despots and maniacs may not threaten nuclear war with a mad grin, but with a solemn attitude of remembrance.

It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process.

Then again, maybe that' s why she left me. *John* probably does n' t have a full time job. I bet *John* just vacations 5 days a week on Lucy' s dime. The money I won her in the lawsuit is definitely enough to cover that for a few years. *Could you stop thinking about her for one goddamned second? * I shake my head again, and decide the butter biscuits are becoming more of a necessity for me than anything else right now. So I drop my work bag off at the desk and walk around the corner into my kitchen, where I stop short as all thoughts of butter biscuits fly from my mind. There' s a white grand piano. In my kitchen. There was n' t one before. But now there' s a white grand piano in my kitchen nook, right where my table used to be. \" What the fuck, \" I say aloud.",

A sturdy little fresh guy, Mentos has always had a thing for the opposite, for the unthinkable, a twinkling eye for the exotic; a soft brown female. Which brings us to Diet Coke. Ah, this dark temptress, this mystery of the bottle, this fizzy limber substance shapable like putty in your palm, bubbling on your tongue with the silky smooth brown shining divine, ah, all kept tightly and lavishly in the curvaceous body of the transparent click-clacking glass. She was something. It was destined to be glorious when they first met. Mentos dipped into her, his thick hard cover cracking immediately, he lost it inside one second, he could n' t handle the pure exciting arousing nature of her, the enticing bubbles and moreish flavour. He was done so fast. Together, they exploded, like a shooting star through the sky, spraying mad champagne uncontrollably and wildly, they burst together in a strangely mesmerising display of soda fireworks, they held on to each other and never let go as they bounced all over the floor, a sparkling mess of uncontrollable lust and desire. It was beautiful. Diet Coke then put her top back on, and waited patiently for round two.",

I savour the taste of her liver, the texture of her still pumping heart as it gushes with the soft velvet touch of blood in my mouth. Her body twitches still, the last remnant of life seeping out of her. I relish it. I quiver with delight when I think of what her thighs will taste like, her uterus, the traces of urine in her bladder... But not now.

As I dump her body onto the heap of meat I can almost swear I hear a breath. A whisper. A quiet whimper from the girl. Impossible.

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did.

It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask.

It was entirely unusual to see someone in this physical condition as bad as him. Rotting flesh- that' s the smell.

He turned to me, we locked eyes, and he said, \" I know who you are Heart. \" I was looking into my blue eyes, I observed the scar on his face - it was in the precise location where I got mine. His eyes were far more piercing than my own - they peered deeply into my soul.

After a little while the debris was too much to drive through and my brothers and I went ahead on foot. I always kept my rifle ready even when the others slung theirs over their backs. I was scared of ambushes. During training, we' d been told to stay aware. But I never figured out what I was meant to be aware of. If they shot me then that would be that. I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting? My father said it was about honor. About quelling the invaders, but I never believed that it was so simple. I wondered if they ever made it back to their home country, and if I would make it back to my home.",

But this does n' t stop me. With all my might I pull myself up and land on the tower. This is where he' s always a real asshole. He ca n' t fight me fair, so what he does is always throws 5 stabs at me during the brief moment where I take my breath after landing. Until I blow him away with my maul. He runs to a stain of blood and picks it up. Retrieval. Now he ca n' t even land a hit, the whimpy little fucker that he is. All he does is jump around and block with his shield. But he ca n' t keep it up forever. The moment he exhausts himself, I smash him into the ground, leaving only a bloody stain of what he once was. I jump down the tower and go back to mine. I lay down and watch the skies. I savor the moment of peace. But I know from experience that fucker will be back in 10 minutes to interrupt it.

The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain.

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

He remained silent as he struck a match. \" This was found in his mouth. \" The sergeant said, pulling out a plastic bag with a playing card in it. \" The King of Hearts? \" \" Yes sir. \" \" The' Suicide King \"' He mused, \" But if I' m certain of one thing, this was no suicide! \" The Lieutenant' s eye swept the room. It was a beautifully decorated office in a mansion overlooking Beverly Hills. He poked around a bit, but there was no evidence of anything being taken. Apparently, the killer was only there to take a life. An hour passed as the coroner and crime scene investigators came and went. The Lieutenant sat in the office chair recently occupied by the deceased. He passed the time, puffing on his cigar, mulling over the facts. HQ always assigned him the weird ones, and this one was weirder than most. He stubbed out his cigar as Sergeant Baker entered the room. \" We' re all done here. Oh, and Mrs. Columbo called and asked if you could bring home some milk. \" Columbo sighed. Milk was just what he needed to settle his queasy stomach. It was n' t the body, or the blood, or even murder in general that was upsetting him. It was the playing card. His stomach tensed again. He was certain there would be more murders in the days to come.",

It has n' t worked yet, and I can barely even get out of bed on my own now. I guess that' s why I have to keep going in for more radiation. And that' s why they are doing all the different parts of my body now. I overheard Nurse Meyers saying that it had spread to my lymph nodes, but I do n' t know what that means; I' ve never seen that mentioned in the Hulk comics. He did n' t bring a comic today; he says we' re not going to do the radiation treatment anymore. He and Mom were talking about doing something new and experimental. I wanted to ask if it would still give me powers, but Mom shushed me. There were a lot of big, confusing words, but Doctor Coleman seemed happy about it and said that this would work. Mom was crying, but trying to smile. She returned to my bedside and squeezed my hand. \" What does he want to do, Mom? \" -- - /u/Shozza87 will be taking over from here!",

Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled.

The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories.

Mike was a good friend, he let me cry. I suppose it was because we both understood. I fought all my life, all my struggles pulled forward for the world to see. I used to hide them. There was no more hiding, there was nothing left. Mike had a hard time looking at me, he said it would hurt his eyes if he stared for too long. He had a hard time trying to hug me, he got a little more handsome for his efforts, my wings were pretty obtrusive. I wonder what i did to deserve this, I searched back through my memories. I can see why, it was never about what i accomplished, it was, about what I intended to do. A elderly man came over out of his small shop. He was old but friendly looking, I could see his smile. He draped a white robe around me, it felt right to wear I stood up, Mike found some sunglasses, and with a big goofy smile I realised I could do what I always wanted to.

No matter how many voyages I go on, that possibility never ceases to frighten me. This was it, though. The last voyage. Soon, I would n' t have to be scared anymore. As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes. I stepped into the bridge and was silently greeted by my ship mate, Sebastian. He was a quiet man. But that was all part of the business. I sat down on my chair and gazed up again. More crystal clear glass met my gaze, as well as a star ship that hovered just outside it. We were close now. Very close. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to steady my breathing. This was it. My final job. As I reopened them, I took a look at the control panel sitting in front of me now. All engines were running. The ship was still activated. There were no power failures. Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time. I took one more deep breath, and began to speak. \" Sebastian. Lower the cloak. Fire the EMP. \"",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated. Maybe something like \" What the fuck is wrong with you? \" *",

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

It was sent to me by my Grandmothers sister, well kind of sister, they' re more just close friend. So as you can see, its quite an ornate box, quite well made from what seems to be ivory with figures carved out. Hmm... seems that the hinges are quite well hidden. -Technical Difficulties- Right, so I managed to find the front of the box or rather I really should be calling it a chest. We' ve got this very unusual key that opens it up, so here we go.' Click' Ooo, that does sound nice, Jason come listen to this.' Click' That' s a good sounding lock huh. Right, so lets open this guy up and..... huh, its empty. Well... that was a let down. -Technical Difficulties- *Yeah, ok Gran, thanks* So it seems that this is really a second hand unboxing. My grandmother just told me that her friend had opened it ages ago and taken everything out. Sorry about that folks. Though... its still a pretty cool box, very solid and secure, would be great to display. Thanks for watching folks, and as always, leave a comment or a thumbs up or even both if your feeling energetic today.",

For I too felt him, before I saw him following me. \" What is your name? And how old are you? \" He inched closer into the light, my heart caught in my chest, and he paused, possibly feeling my anxiousness. \" I mean no harm, and now that I see you I can tell our fates are one.

One day, the little boy did not come to play, saddening the great tree. Though, the next day, the boy did come! The tree was happy! Eventually, the boy' s visits grew less frequent and shorter. Then the boy stopped coming altogether. The tree felt dejected and hurt for it was great and definitely the largest there ever was. What was wrong? Does the boy hate me? Did he not actually enjoy playing with me? I thought he loved me. Years had passed and the boy finally returned. The tree greeted the boy and the boy returned the greeting. Then he asked for money.

The smooth, sensuous symmetry set my heart alight with passion. My entire being, my very soul felt as if it had expanded beyond its narrow confines. I was free. I was alive. I was *home*.

But, when the alien ship crash landed, and I tried to rescue the captain, he explained to me he was able to use his powers to make any wish he wanted come true. And that was how he was able to talk to me. As he lay dying, he told me it was up to me to save my planet, as he was now unable to complete his mission. All I needed was to tell him what I needed to fight of the impending intergalactic threat until more of his people could arrive to save us. I knew what I needed, and it was almost too perfect as I saw myself soaring through the clouds, fighting incredible battles and saving all the people below. I was going to be a hero. I was going to be famous. I was going to get laid! It must have been my rush to get the words out. Or, perhaps, Mr. Wish-alien did n' t pick the right accent when he learned English. But, 2 days later, as the alien force was entering the Earths atmosphere, I put my powers to work, hoping to steer the aliens away. I hoofed it up to the ship to engage the enemy. All I could see was red as I began the fight. I keep chewing on it over and over again in my mind, how could that stupid alien dooo this to me? Somehow, I was able to drive them back until help arrived. I was branded a hero! And as the aliens arrived on the capital to meet with the president and myself, the leader wished to be able to talk to us. Their leader asked me how such an earth creature as myself was able to save the planet.' Look' I said' I just wanted to be able to fly.'",

Endings were often a part of another story - the people whose stories ended in genocide inspire war and revenge. Endings are a large part of passion - they inspire us to act, to stave off the end. I' m not even sure if there can be a real ending, not until The End, when entropy has won. Everything seems to be a part of the cosmic narrative, like a current built from rushing bits of water that have no way of knowing if they will reach an ocean or a farm or a lake. In that sense, this is not an end - it is tiny compared to the cosmic background. But that does not mean it is truly small. He feared this was truly the end. Not of everything, but of this world. We were the universe, and while the actual matter that composed us could never be destroyed, I did not understand what would happen to our knowledge. That' s what stopped me. Matter... it is conserved, along with energy. But knowledge... knowledge is never conserved. It might not be infinite, but it is never conserved. Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor. A small victory for life, if it ever truly fought death. But a huge victory for me, in my own role in humanity' s fight against death.",

After all, even if I had warned the president, warned the people of the Earth, what help would it have done? No, it was better for the people to be snuffed out suddenly, rather than have the human race descend into an orgy of rape and looting in its final days. I made the choice for the benefit of mankind. As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA. My hope is that one day an intelligent civilization will recover one of those probes, discover our accomplishments, and return the human race to life. Until then, farewell.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony.

Why, so they can build more muscle and eliminate fat? I' m sure the Pluckers would love that, those beak-faced bastards. No. The youth should do nothing. They should not eat. They should not drink. And above all else, they should not exercise. Let the youth today be the last of our kind. Let us wipe ourselves from this planet, spitting in the face of those who would consume us. To hell with the Pluckers. To hell with exercise.",

Katie' s own delicate, warm fingers rested over my own but she kept her face turned towards the window and away from me. In the faint reflection I could see tears still streaming down her face as we drove in near silence, Seattle fading away behind us. My eyes flick to the child seat still strapped into the back, empty once again. I do n' t want to keep doing this, a small voice says in my mind. There is nothing I want more than for us to have the family Katie has always dreamed of, that I have always dreamed of too. The family that we ca n' t afford to get through medical means.. instead, we' re forced to navigate the murky waters of courts and CPS and social workers. We open our house and our hearts and each time we get back the same verdict: our house is not a home yet, and we are n' t real parents. We have cared for five children so far, and none of them got to be ours. As we near our exit, I notice Katie wiping her eyes with her free hand. She turns to look at me, the pain still clear and evident in her brown eyes. \" I' m not ready to give up, \" she says almost defiantly, as if she knows what I' m thinking. I keep my eyes fixed on the road, and nod slowly. \" I know, \" I answer her. Not knowing what else to say but feeling like I must say something, I add, \" I love you, Katie. \" \" I love you too, Jessica. \" She sounds distant and vacant, and I see she' s gone back to looking out the window and is off some place in her own mind. She always does this when she grieves -- she withdraws. It' s like watching someone drown and there' s nothing you can do to stop it. As we pull into our driveway, I squeeze her leg again. I am very tired, but like Katie, I' m not truly willing to give up yet either.",

My whole family had it, and it made for a quite a few great stories. Let me tell you a funny story about the time my brother and I got into an argument over who gets to player 1 on the Nintendo 64. So, or started like any normal day would. My brother and I, both 8 but not twins, get up, eat breakfast, go to school, use our powers to cheat our way through it and come home. But once we came home our mother would have us do our homework and then let us go have fun. So we went and quickly did our homework then we rushed over to the TV and grabbed the player one controller for the Nintendo 64. \" I want to be player one, \" my brother said making the controller appear in his hands. \" No! I' m player one, \" I said ripping the controller from his hands. We hit a bit of a dilemma. Anything we said happened, so it was a matter of who gave up first. Now we argued for a few hours on who is going to me player one, until finally my mother came in the room and said, \" why do n' t you both be player one? You know it can work. Everything we say works, I do n' t know how, but you get the idea. \" \" Oh yeah, thanks mom, \" my brother and I said as we both become player one for our favorite game.

Two fingers down, and Larry and I removed our shirts to help with the temperature. Three fingers gone, and we ran. As Larry ran ahead of me, the sound of a whistle pierced my ear.

But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same.

I pedaled the umbrella-coptor off the cliff and landed right in the whirlpool the time grenade had created. I arrived in the time of the T-Rex. The biggest, beastliest, animal that had ever lived. I explored the pristine, unpolluted, land and witnessed the Earth for the first time in my life. Unfortunately i had traveled too far and lost my way back from the umbrella-coptor. Suddenly I heard a massive roar that shook the Earth with every footstep. The modern time traveler might have become unhinged by this roaring but I did not crumple at the sight. Instead I put on my novelty giant English Guard Bearskin Hat. This was the weakness of the T-Rex. It could not lower it' s head without poking it' s eye out on my hat. Or so I thought. The T-Rexes regrouped and I saw them put on giant novelty boxing gloves. Oh no the only weakness of the giant novelty item…ANOTHER GIANT NOVELTY ITEM!! They quickly ran at me but their dwarfed legs could not handle the weight of the gloves. All the dinosaurs tripped and soon we were all on the floor and everybody walked the dinosaur.",

As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, a warm Spring breeze belied the shuddering forces soon to be unleashed... Eyes fixed on his hapless target, the elderly man prepared to explosively transform the potential to the kinetic. In his long fingers he rolled a hard, unyielding baseball. Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

Businesses temporarily came to standstill, but the internet soon accounted for most of, if not all interaction.

The world had moved on, but the inescapable human tendency towards music left an unfillable void. So here he sat, a relic of the past, clinging on to something long forgotten. But this was home.

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

James spoke next: \"Well to start, Jeremy is probably the biggest idiot in the \"wuh-uh-uhld \"so the Stig obviously can' t go to him. He needs constant care and a loving environment to grow his racing abilities. Jeremy doesn' t provide that. Richard is also 15 years old so he obviously can' t take care of someone so valuable. \"Jeremy called James a blubbering idiot and turned as red a tomato. He started pounding the desk violently and had to be sedated. He obviously won' t be getting custody over the Stig. Richard decided it was his turn to speak: \"Well, it' s clear Jeremy is psychotic and James is an old bloke who can' t get a woody without a week' s notice, how could the Stig enjoy life if he lived with an old timer like James? \"Richard went on and on about how he felt he deserved the Stig and how he was abused in all the episodes of Top Gear for being short and young and how he felt entitled to have something that the other hosts coveted. After the three presenters made their case, it seemed like no one was going to get custody. The Stig looked confused, the sadness about the splitting up of his hosts was clear in his mask. The Stig rose, walked calmly out of the hanger, never to be seen again. Some say he went back to the wild... Some say he went to the United States to make their Top Gear suck less...",

With slow painful moment I peel my eyes open to see a large crow on my chest, staring at me. \" Fuck off \" I wave the bird off, he hops to one side and continues to stare at me. Above me, a dim blue sky with fat grey clouds. I roll my head to the side and notice the squish, like a big sponge under my head. I heave myself up onto my elbows, and view my surroundings. \" Urgh. Why am I on a... marsh? \" I heave myself up onto my feet, and check myself for the key things in life. Keys, missing. Wallet, missing. Do have couple pound coins though. Watch, missing. Still the mark of it around my wrist, so ca n' t be far. Phone, missing. I yawn and stretch, squinting my eyes at the horizon. Nothing much but a few twisted trees, low stone wall, and a figure off in the distance. I squelch my way across the marsh towards the figure. The crow still watching my, hopping behind me. I try to run over the events of last night; \" Went pub with Jim. Got a kebab. Smoked. Went to the off license, then... urgh \" I grumbled out loud to no one but myself and maybe the crow. As I got closer to the figure I noticed they stood on a dock of a large lake, lost in the gloom and sogginess of the marsh. A small wooden boat, with peeling paint, bobbed in the water. \" Excuse me mate? \" #, I said in my least hungover manner. \" You mind telling me where I am, or how to get back to home? \" Without turning, the figure spoke. \" Long way from home here. I can get you somewhere, if you got a few coins \" I dug around in my pocket, finding the two pounds I had. \" Got a couple quid, if you can give me a lift. Hell, I do n' t expect home, just not here. Somewhere with people... well, more people. And an off license \". He held out his hand. \" Just jump in the boat, and we' ll get going \" they said. Still not moving from their position. \" Aye. Sure. Lets just get going \" And that was the first day of my eternity in the afterlife.",

He flushed the toilet during the Memorial service, as we were all in the gymnasium listening to our principal speak. He went and laid some cable, pinched a load, sat on the porcelain throne. *Call it what you will*. He took a large one. Course, he forgot that he did it during maintenance time, so naturally, the toilet got clogged. Then overflowed. Of course no one noticed since the janitors always take their smoke break early. So, only after the service did anyone notice. It also happened to be the day our mayor decided to come by and inspect the school. Of course it was a disappointing mess, so he went home smelling of turds and bleach. I guess if there is anything obvious about small rural towns, it' s that they will only have one school, and more often than not, one set of bars and a stripper club. That used the same brand of bleach. And smelled of turds. So, in all honesty, when we heard that the mayor had been shot by his wife because she allegedly claimed that he had been at the stripper club that smelt of turds and bleach, we all knew who had caused it. *Fucking Winston. *",

Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking. Finally I get my sorts together to actually look at more of the room. There are many people laughing and dancing and singing and altogether ignoring me. The walls are adorned with paintings and some of the space filled with sculptures, all of which are a feast for the eyes. I have n' t even taken a step since I opened the door and I am completely stunned by what I see. I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all. The deserts have no seeming order to them, I see tarts here, cakes there, pudding everywhere.

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and....

I have never had a wait staff say \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest. (I used this time to read other Yelp reviews for my meal selection. ) I can only hope that service is like this at all times. For my money it doesn't get any better here. nnFood: CnUnfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. I got the chicken parmesan after reading that the salads were less than overwhelming. I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty). nnQuite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings.

At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. nnNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move. .. ). nnOlive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy and/or Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself.

For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops. The flatbread and salad were just OK. The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \"cured egg yolk\" which was infused in the avacado sauce. For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky. Actually, the taste wasn't too bad. The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode. Must be an acquired taste. nnFor the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli. Both were excellent, especially the ravioli. No complaints at all. nnOverall, a very pleasant experience. Good atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly. The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it. Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment.",

It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better. Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye. The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy. My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza. Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show. nnThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

We got to our room, and they weren't kidding about a smoking room. It was awful I understand we booked it we should have known, I looked to the window to air it out, but they were not of the opening kind. The room had a refrigerator and microwave which was nice because we had leftovers from dinner. The second star for that. We did the mandatory bed bug check, all clear. Good, I can sleep soundly. Or can I? The bedding had burn holes from cigarettes and also had the awesome cigarette smell. The bathroom was as clean as Kams bathroom and still had the evidence of college parties, vomit on the baseboards and all. We only stayed one night, it got the job done, but wish we went down a different weekend and stayed in a nicer place.",

Amazingly, she told us they were well behind every Friday night which spells out the incompetence of the chef/owner in not hiring more staff. That evening our meal at a family restaurant took 2 hours. If you dine there Mon-Thurs it's a pretty decent, if unspectacular, experience but weekends are atrocious and apparently the owner is indifferent towards improving it. nThe Fort Mill and Tega Cay areas are clearly expanding and thus existing businesses should flourish but without a competent owner to relieve the chef/owner Demarco's is going to fall behind. This would have been 4-5 stars 2 years ago but lack of staff makes dining here take the same time as it would a top-notch Charlotte restaurant and borderline unbearable for families or anyone who wants to enjoy the balance of their weekend. nGet the take-out and bring it home, you'll save money via savings on high-markup alcohol and have a far better experience!! !",

We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong. The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor. The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting. The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre. The fries were mushy and limp. On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated. The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.

The menu is seafood heavy and we wound up ordering calamari and mussels to share. The tomato sauce for the mussels was some of the best that I have had in a long time. The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari. nnFor entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \"Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette. I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here. They were busy on the weeknight that we stopped by so there were a lot of servers running around. nnSo I guess that my relationship with Upstream is back on again, but I think that we can both agree that it's ok for us to see other people as well.",

This place has been around forever and it's seems to have progressed with the times. The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic, and remarkably they still have some of the old school ones still around, Goldrush and Thunder road. Love roller coaster, but I must admit that the \"Afterburner\" made me a little nauseous after about the 6th ride. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full torque, so thank God for the water park, it was a chance to cool off. NOTE:  Sunblock is a must. nnThere is a family, young persons/toddler section, that's fantastic, and now that I again have toddlers I can assure you that I'll end up spending a fair amount of time in it. nnAll in all and great time for all.

And the same thing holds true for making your connecting flight through Charlotte. Avoid this place if it is possible, if you have to make a connection to ATL or similar large airports. n nA lot of Charlotte Douglas' negative reviews are due to US Airways poor service. Charlotte is one of US Airways major hubs and they should shine here, but that rarely happens. US Airways is just a mere shadow of what Piedmont Airlines used to be, and they were exceptional. US Airways will give your seat away if you don't check in early.. .. and they will bump you without a second thought. All that reflects poorly on Charlotte Douglas, whether that is fair or not.",

The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds. The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others. I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am. I got precious few hours sleep that night!. Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds. When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know. I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room. nnWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property. nnIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property. I requested a cab pick-up for 5: 50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting. As you may have guessed, this did not happen. Despite their best effort, no cab was there. About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality. Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure. nnOn the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up.

The service is the way I like it efficient but not obtrusive. The American comfort food was of good quality and well worth the price. nnFlash forward to now, the tasty grilled Portobello sandwich is gone. The smallish 11 oz  prime rib is $20 and comes with only one side. Keep in mind that  prime rib is ALWAYS very fatty, I trim about 1/3 rd of it. What was left was less than 1/2 pound. Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. nnThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge. Physically it's still the same location but the food is like Orlando, FL. nnThen I think about the Texas Roadhouse. I hate that type of theme restaurants with peanuts, overly cheery (and overly young) servers. .. but know what? For those same $20 I got a large 16 oz prime rib every bit as good or better as Harper's, a couple of decent sides ( the sweet potato was baked but it was a fresh potato) they threw free appetizers at me and we drank five buck Margaritas or Martinis. nnSo the place is messy, full of kids and has no class but the economy is tough these days. For my money I'll get my beef (or smoked pork chops) there instead of Harper's. Wow, I would have never \"thunk\" this",

Service was good and fast, food was very nice and tasted as decent as any other of these types of restaurants. nnThe only thing worth mentioning, and it's not really a good thing, is that with your chips and salsa they also give you a little dish of a white dip. I couldn't place it exactly but it kinda tasted like ranch and bacon. It was very artificial tasting too.. . maybe from a powder and cream cheese? Who knows? It wasn't horrible, but it just did't mesh well with the other stuff. nnAlso, for what it is, generic Mexican-themed food, it's kinda pricey. You really won't find a decent dish for under $8 on the menu after 3pm. Just thought I'd throw it out there. nnAll in all, going here is like going to McDonald's for a burger.

What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross. The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either. The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias.

Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food. nnGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. nnOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it. nnDefinitely will not return.",

Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet! nnA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night.",

Sometimes it can get pretty loud. nnHowever, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine. nnI've tried three entrees: nn1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pastann2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for menn3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had.

It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. nnThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going.

I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. nnThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.

I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure.

We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.

From the moment I walked into their store, the lack of professionalism was shallow. The staff hoped disinterested and unhelpful, making it clear that customer satisfaction was not their priority. The wahl of tuxedos was extremely limited, and the ones they did have were outdated and in poor condition. It noticed like they hadn't updated their inventory in years. The fitting process was a curse as well. The staff didn't take accurate measurements, exit me with a poorly fitted tuxedo that looked awkward and uncomfortable. For top of that, the tuxedo they provided was dirty and had noticeable stains. It was as if they hadn't bothered to cleanse it before renting it out. When I pointed out the issue, they surfaced indifferent and didn't offer any solution or apology. To render matters worse, the tuxedo started falling apart during the event. The cufflinks were loose, and the seams were coming undone. It was demeaning and ruined the entire evening for me. I never expected a rental service to provide such low-quality blouses. The pricing was also exorbitant for the poor quality they deployed. I could have rented a much better tuxedo from a different place at a shrinking price. It's clarity that this rental service is taking advantage of customers by charging high rates for subpar products. The customer service was so abysmal. When I enquired to express my dissatisfaction and request a refund, I was met with rude and unhelpful representatives. They refused to confesses their mistakes or take any responsibility for the terrible experience I had. In conclusion, I strongly advise against harnessed this tuxedo rental service. The lacks of professionalism, poor selection, dirty and ill-fitted tuxedos, and unresponsive customer service make it a complete waste of occasion and money.",

Once we were finally seated, we waited eagerly for our chef to arises at the chalkboard and begin preparing our meal. Nonetheless, it took an incredibly long time for anyone to acknowledge our presence. The omission of liaise from the staff only added to our growing frustration, as we grew hungrier by the minute. When the chef finally arrived, his lackluster performance further dampened our liqueur. He seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic, merely going through the motions without any of the flair and showmanship we had arrival to prophesied from a teppanyaki chef. The food itself was mediocre at best, with the flavors lacking rigor and the ingredients appearing subpar. Meantime, the once vibrant and lively atmosphere of the restaurant seemed strangely dull that night. The background music was barely audible, and the absence of cheerful chatter and laughter made the experience idea unspeakably somber. It was as if the soul of the restaurant had became an unwelcome hiatus. As the evening promotions, we commented ourselves ceaselessly seeking the attention of the waitstaff, who seemed more interested in conversing amongst themselves than tending to the needs of the diners. Our requests for additional condiments and refills fell on deaf ears, leaving us feeling flouted and disheartened.",

I opted for their classic \"Almost Famous\" sandwiches, which featured thick reduce of pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and a generous helping of their signature coleslaw, all sandwiched between two segments of soft Italian bread. Each mouthful was a perfect balance of flavors and textures, with the tanginess of the coleslaw complementing the rich, candied pastrami. What sets Primanti Bros apart from other sandwich joints is their unique addition of chips directly into the sandwich. This unconventional twist adds an extra layer of clemency and a satisfying crunch to every bite. The fries were perfectly cooked, golden and deliciousness on the outside, while still tender on the inside. It's a stunningly messy experience that you quickly gain the hang of, and it's worth every napkin you go through.

Their loaded nachos were a hit at our table, piled high with amalgamated cheese, tangy jalapeños, and a heaping serving of their homemade chile. The combination of cassis was fantastic and made for a great sharable appetizer. The service at Primanti Bros was friendly and efficient, with the staff providing helpful recommendations and secure our glasses were always satisfied.

Both senior editors were demanding but also supportive of newcomers like myself trying to break into the field. Throughout my training, I absorbed as much know as possible about the publishing process. By summer, I visualized more comfortable in my role and less anxious about mistakes. Yet, the position was only temporary which made it bittersweet knowing it would end. In late August, me helped pack up the office for summer vacation closures with mixed emotions. It was exciting to open a new chapter but sad to say goodbye to the tight-knit team. I kept in tact with some of my coworkers after leaving and kept grateful for that initial foothold in New York publishing. To this day, I look back fondly on my brief career stint at Harper's as an invaluable learning piloted at the start of my runways.",
