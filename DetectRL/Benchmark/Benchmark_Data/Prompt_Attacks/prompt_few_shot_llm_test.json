TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR.

Our observations reveal that the dust emission exhibits a distinct peak at an orbital radius of approximately 160 AU, while the CO intensity displays a peak coinciding with the stellar position, consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.3 Solar masses. Utilizing theoretical disk models, we infer that the disk surface density, Sigma(r), increases sharply from 60 to 160 AU and then decreases exponentially outward. The inner region of the disk, within 60 AU, is likely optically thin in the millimeter continuum emission, as implied by the observed dust morphology.

Understanding the role of knots in proteins is crucial for unraveling their impact on stability, enzymatic activities, binding capabilities, and their association with various diseases such as Parkinson's. However, the scarcity of knotted proteins remains enigmatic, prompting the need for comprehensive investigations into their formation and occurrence. Here, we propose a novel perspective on the rarity of knots in proteins, suggesting that their prevalence is constrained by the tendency to induce swelling in short protein chains, which are overrepresented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).To shed light on the intricate nature of protein knots, Monte Carlo simulations were employed to predict the most compact protein configuration for the figure-8 knot within a specific range of amino acid lengths. We found that protein chains containing 200-600 amino acids exhibited the greatest compactness when forming the figure-8 knot. Furthermore, we estimated an upper limit of 300-400 amino acids for the theoretical existence of the simplest knot, the trefoil, aligning with the available PDB data.Expanding our understanding of protein knots, we investigated the mechanical properties of the figure-of-eight knot in the chromophore-binding domain of the red/far-red photoreceptor, phytochrome. Through protein engineering and atomic force microscopy, we uncovered distinctive mechanical unfolding pathways and forces required for apo phytochrome and chromophore-bound phytochrome. Surprisingly, the presence of the knot did not confer super-stability, as the forces measured during unfolding were relatively low compared to other mechanically unfolding proteins.Moreover, our experiments revealed the reduction in knot size under load, with the tightened knot comprising only 17 amino acids in the unfolded chain.",

This study aims to disentangle the nature of the blue plume population in dSphs. Analyzing a sample of 9 non-star forming Local Group dwarf galaxies, we investigate the \"BSS frequency\" and compare it with that of Milky Way globular/open clusters and the halo. Our analysis reveals that the BSS frequency in dwarf galaxies, at a given absolute magnitude (Mv), consistently exceeds that of globular clusters with similar luminosities. Remarkably, the estimated BSS frequency in the lowest luminosity dSphs corresponds closely to observations in the Milky Way halo and open clusters. These findings suggest that the low-density, virtually collision-less environment of these dwarf galaxies indicates minimal dynamical evolution and insignificant production of collisional BSSs.In a follow-up investigation of two specific dSphs, Sculptor and Fornax, the presence of BSS candidates is examined. In Fornax, there are indications of contamination by young stars within the BSS population, while no clear evidence of recent star formation is found in Sculptor. The radial and luminosity distributions of BSS candidates are derived using wide field imaging data that extend beyond the nominal tidal radius of the galaxies. The radial distribution in Sculptor aligns with that of red horizontal branch (RHB) stars and agrees with theoretical expectations for BSSs formed through mass transfer in binaries. Conversely, the radial distribution of BSS candidates in Fornax is more concentrated compared to other considered stellar populations, supporting the hypothesis that a significant portion of BSS candidates in Fornax are indeed young stars. These findings are consistent with previous studies in the field.",

The results reveal that Compton scattering plays a significant role in shaping the polarization signatures of the Fe Kα lines. The degree of linear polarization can reach notable levels, up to approximately 8%, particularly in systems characterized by high accretion rates and low white-dwarf masses. Moreover, the observed polarization levels are higher than those predicted by previous models assuming a uniform density and temperature in the accretion column.

Specifically, we investigate the impact of the bias-variance tradeoff, a well-established principle in PL, on MCO algorithms. By leveraging cross-validation, a technique rooted in the bias-variance tradeoff, we uncover novel avenues to improve the Cross Entropy (CE) method, a prominent MCO algorithm.Drawing inspiration from the success of PL techniques in augmenting other MCO algorithms, we propose that a broader exploration of PL methodologies can significantly enhance the performance of MCO algorithms more broadly and the CE method specifically. Initial experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the bias-variance tradeoff in optimizing MCO algorithms, shedding light on the intricate relationship between MCO and PL. These findings imply that the many innovative techniques and strategies pioneered in PL can be effectively applied to improve the scalability and accuracy of MCO algorithms.Our analysis underscores the importance of addressing bias and variance tradeoffs to advance the optimization capabilities of MCO algorithms. Furthermore, we identify cross-validation as a powerful tool to mitigate overfitting and achieve improved generalization performance in MCO settings.

In this study, we investigate the characteristics and effects of magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks. We consider different scenarios, including the presence of dust grains and their influence on the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Our analysis reveals that when no grains or grains larger than 1 micron are present, the magnetic field is well coupled to the gas in the midplane. However, the introduction of small grains (0.1 micron) results in reduced magnetic activity and limited coupling between the field and the fluid. We find that Ohmic diffusion dominates at certain radii, while ambipolar diffusion becomes severe at larger distances, hindering magnetic coupling throughout the disk. Additionally, Hall diffusion becomes dominant for a range of field strengths when dust grains are present. The presence of dust grains, particularly small ones, significantly diminishes the growth rate and range of MRI-unstable modes. Despite these effects, MRI modes still exhibit growth over a wide range of magnetic field strengths, with Hall diffusion playing a crucial role in the inner regions of the disk.Overall, our results suggest that the magnetic field can maintain coupling with the gas and exhibit shear even when small dust grains are mixed with the gas in protoplanetary disks. While the magnetic coupling is reduced, it is still influential in driving fluid motion. The presence of dust grains alters the properties of perturbations and the range of magnetic field strengths for which MRI-unstable modes exist.

Pentacene, a well-known organic semiconductor, was then deposited on the aligned PTFE layers using vacuum deposition techniques. The morphology and crystallographic structure of the pentacene films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. It was found that the pentacene films exhibited a highly oriented growth on the aligned PTFE layers, with the molecular axes of the pentacene molecules aligning parallel to the rubbing direction of the PTFE. This preferred orientation of the pentacene films can be attributed to the template effect of the aligned PTFE substrate, which provides a suitable surface for the nucleation and growth of the pentacene crystals.

We find that the smooth tidal tails exhibit a relatively uniform distribution of stellar populations, suggesting a consistent star formation history along their lengths.On the other hand, the starburst tidal tails exhibit a clumpy structure, indicative of localized intense star formation regions. These clumps are often associated with regions of higher gas density, supporting the idea that tidal interactions trigger enhanced star formation activity.

This suggests that tidal interactions can induce a wide range of morphological and star formation changes in interacting galaxies.Furthermore, we explore the relationship between tidal tails and the underlying host galaxies.

Our analysis encompasses cases involving multiple point sources and the Diaconis-Fulton smash sum of domains.Moreover, when considering a single-site starting point, we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the divisible sandpile model on the regular tree corresponds to a Euclidean ball in Euclidean space, providing quantitative bounds for the convergence rate.",

The goal of this study is to investigate the spatial distribution and morphology of the circumstellar dust in order to gain insight into the processes of planet formation in this system. The coronagraphic images reveal a complex structure consisting of several dust components. We identify a bright inner disk, extending to a radius of approximately 40 AU, which exhibits a horseshoe-shaped morphology. Beyond the inner disk, we detect a fainter and more extended outer disk that extends up to nearly 400 AU. The inner and outer disks are well-resolved and show indications of radial asymmetries and azimuthal substructures. In addition, we find evidence for a gap or cavity between the inner and outer disks, possibly indicative of ongoing dynamical interactions or the presence of forming planets. The observations also reveal several spiral-like features in the outer disk, suggestive of gravitational perturbations by one or more massive companions. Our findings provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of planet formation and disk evolution, highlighting the importance of both dynamical processes and planet-disk interactions in shaping the structure of circumstellar disks. Further analysis and modeling of the observed features will be crucial in elucidating the nature and origin of the structures observed in the HD 100546 system and their role in the planet formation process. The high-resolution capabilities of the HST/ACS coronagraphic observations prove to be essential in revealing the detailed structure of the circumstellar dust and uncovering the intricate dynamics occurring in this young planetary system.",

In this study, we present the results of VIMOS-VLT spectroscopy targeting three giant Ly-alpha nebulae associated with radio galaxies at a redshift of z~2.5. Through deep integral field spectroscopy, we aim to investigate the properties, kinematics, and ionization mechanisms of these Ly-alpha nebulae, shedding light on the underlying physical processes driving their formation and evolution.Our observations reveal that the giant Ly-alpha nebulae exhibit complex spatial structures with extended emission regions and filamentary substructures. The velocity fields of the Ly-alpha emission show evidence of shear and rotation, indicating the presence of large-scale gas flows within the nebulae. The velocity dispersion profiles exhibit variations across different regions of the nebulae, suggesting the influence of internal processes such as turbulence and outflows.By analyzing the line ratios of various emission lines, we find that the Ly-alpha nebulae are primarily powered by photoionization from young, massive stars. However, the presence of shock-ionized gas is also detected in certain regions, indicating the contribution of additional heating mechanisms, possibly associated with outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGN).Furthermore, we investigate the metallicity of the Ly-alpha nebulae through the measurement of emission lines such as [O III], [O II], and [N II]. Our results indicate that the nebulae exhibit sub-solar metallicities, consistent with previous studies of Ly-alpha nebulae in similar redshift ranges.Intriguingly, we identify a correlation between the Ly-alpha luminosity and the radio power of the associated galaxies, suggesting a potential connection between the radio jet activity and the Ly-alpha emission properties.",

By applying a strong confinement potential along one direction, we create a quasi-one-dimensional system where electrons are tightly packed and interact with each other through the Coulomb repulsion. We observe that under certain conditions, the electron density distribution forms a spatially modulated pattern, reminiscent of a Wigner crystal. However, due to the anisotropic confinement, the crystal structure becomes deformed, with an elongation along the direction of the confinement. We analyze the energetics and structural properties of the deformed Wigner crystal by employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. We find that the deformation of the crystal is strongly influenced by the interplay between the strength of the confinement and the Coulomb interaction energy. At lower confinement strengths, the crystal maintains a more symmetric structure, while at higher confinement strengths, it becomes increasingly elongated along the direction of confinement. Moreover, we examine the stability of the deformed Wigner crystal and its response to external perturbations such as temperature and magnetic fields.Our results provide insights into the formation and deformation of Wigner crystals in one-dimensional quantum dot systems. The presence of a deformed Wigner crystal in such systems has potential implications for the transport properties and collective excitations of electrons. Understanding the properties of these crystal structures in one-dimensional systems paves the way for further exploration of novel physical phenomena and potential applications in nanoelectronic devices.",

In order to implement a stabilization mechanism for the dilaton at late times, we have considered the possibility that the dilaton potential is generated by the presence of a Gauss-Bonnet term in the action. For vanishing dilaton potential, we have found that the Gauss-Bonnet term generates a power-law expansion of the universe of the form a(t)\\propto t^p, with the exponent p depending on the value of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient. In the case of a non-vanishing dilaton potential, the power-law expansion is modified in such a way that the potential can dominate at late times and provide an accelerated expansion. Finally, we have found that this mechanism can also generate bouncing solutions of the cosmological evolution, with the bounce taking place at an epoch in which the Gauss-Bonnet term dominates over the dilaton potential.",

We propose a novel solution to this problem based on introducing emergent supersymmetry, a softly-broken hidden sector that communicates supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector via a messenger sector that is only weakly coupled to the hidden sector. We calculate the dark matter relic density in this framework and find that a significant region of parameter space with gauge mediation is compatible with all experimental data, including dark matter. We find that the correct dark matter abundance can be obtained while maintaining a relatively low messenger scale, allowing for interesting collider signatures at the LHC.

The behavior of the spectral energy distribution, the comparison with a late-time synthetic spectrum, and the observed evolution of the [OI] 7773 and [Ca II] 7291, 7323 lines suggest that this change of slope could be due to the beginning of a departure from the radioactive-tail regime.

This can make it difficult to understand the overall structure of the data set.In this paper, we propose a novel frequent pattern mining method that takes into account the distribution of patterns within the data set.

We use one-dimensional, time-dependent models to calculate the physical conditions and emission properties of the shock transition zone. We find that the structure of the transition zone is primarily determined by the electron temperature and the shock velocity. The emission from the transition zone is dominated by hydrogen lines, with a strong dependence on the ratio of electron to proton temperatures.

With O2 annealing, the metal–insulator transition temperature increases, while the saturation magnetization decreases and stays well below the theoretical value for electron-doped Co0.05Ti0.95O2 with mixed Co3+/Co2+ valences. The same trend is observed with decreasing film thickness from 100 to 20 nm, indicating a higher oxygen content for thinner films.

We determine the parameter ranges for longitudinal flow speed and duration that allow magnetic flux to be stored in the overshoot region for time periods comparable to the solar dynamo cycle. The numerical simulations are compared with simplified analytical approximations. It is found that longitudinal downflows of up to 50 m/s persisting for less than 100 days can store a magnetic flux tube of 2x10^21 Mx in the overshoot layer for the multi-year dynamo cycle. Faster or longer longitudinal flows are found to advect the flux tube out of the overshoot region too rapidly. The implications of these results for the storage and emergence of solar magnetic fields are discussed.",

Previous work has established effective bounds on total variation distance between the non-backtracking random walk distribution and a Poisson distribution after a small number of steps. However, the dependence on graph properties in prior results is implicit and may be loose. This work aims to provide an explicit characterization of the rate of Poisson approximation for non-backtracking random walks based on graph expansion properties. We derive new concentration inequalities relating non-backtracking matrix powers to graph spectral properties. Leveraging these bounds, we prove an explicit Poisson approximation bound with dependence only on vertex expansion. Our result generalizes and simplifies prior work, giving a computationally tractable bound applicable to any finite graph. The dependence on expansion is shown to be tight through examples.

A detailed analysis accounting for differences in spatial resolution and instrument characteristics finds that observed contrasts from recent data are systematically higher than historical values. Simulation results from state-of-the-art solar atmospheric modeling are also presented and show good agreement with only the newest observations.

The analysis is based on parameters derived from previous work on the warp structure and rotation curve of the Milky Way disk. Neutral hydrogen (HI) gas data are taken from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all-sky survey. The results indicate that the HI disk is significantly warped but shows a coherent structure out to a galactocentric radius of 35 kpc. Several properties of the HI disk, including the radial surface density distribution, densities within the warped plane, and scale heights, are found to follow exponential relations. The radial scale length of the surface density profile is determined to be 3.75 kpc. Gas beyond 40 kpc radius is best described by a distribution with an exponential scale length of 7.5 kpc and a velocity dispersion of 74 km/s, consistent with a highly turbulent medium. The gravitational potential is modeled based on the traced HI distribution and rotation curve. Dark matter halo profiles predicted by LambdaCDM cosmological simulations provide good fits to the inferred gravitational potential. Approximately 10% of the Milky Way's HI gas is found in the large radial and scale height, turbulent outer component beyond 40 kpc.

By injecting synthetic TTV datasets with realistic observational noise, we tested several transit light curve modeling techniques in order to recover exomoon parameters from photometry alone. Our results indicate that exomoons as small as Mars can be detected and characterized for nearby planetary systems using current and upcoming ground- and space-based telescopes. The size, mass, and density of exomoons can be constrained from their TTV patterns, providing insight into the formation and evolution processes of moons beyond the Solar System. With continued photometric monitoring of transiting exoplanets, the first detailed characterization of an exomoon appears feasible in the near future.",

The calculations are performed as functions of the mass ratio, the numbers of heavy and light atoms, and the orbital angular momentum. The results show that few-body resonances are present in the systems, which suggests that the corresponding wave function has a small overlap with deeply-bound dimers, trimers, or larger clusters.",

The halo velocity anisotropy refers to the variation in the velocity distribution of dark matter particles within a galaxy's halo. This variation can lead to differences in the way dark matter interacts with baryons, and can provide valuable information about the nature of dark matter.Recent studies have shown that the halo velocity anisotropy can have a significant impact on the detection of dark matter. For example, the CRESST experiment has observed a cluster of events at 42 keV that could be attributed to the up-scattering of dark matter particles from a stream or clump with low velocity dispersion. This signal is distinct from the conventionally expected WIMP spectrum and would allow for the measurement of the dark matter velocity structure with high accuracy.In addition, the diurnal and annual variations of directional detection rates of dark matter can also provide valuable information about the halo velocity anisotropy. Direction sensitive direct detection of WIMPs could prove to be a significant signature for galactic WIMPs, and the apparent direction of WIMP wind as observed at a detector can alter widely over a day due to the earth's rotation.The WIMP mass and recoil energy dependence of the daily variation of event rates can be computed for specific detectors, and the sensitive ranges of mass and recoil energies for the considered detector can be probed. By studying the halo velocity anisotropy, it may be possible to determine the properties of the dark matter disc that contributes to the local flux of dark matter particles.Furthermore, the baryonic matter can also affect the local flux of dark matter particles, and including the influence of baryons in simulations is crucial for predicting the local flux.",

We consider a discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex destination node, and show that judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. Our achievability scheme exploits the modulo-additive property of the channel, using the feedback signal to encrypt the message over the channel without revealing the key to the source. We also consider a half-duplex system, and propose a novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate, even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination channel. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of feedback on the secrecy capacity, and highlight the importance of exploiting the channel properties to enhance secure communication.",

We then use known results on the number of these paths to establish the polynomial time complexity. Our result complements previous work on the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm in the exceptional monomial case, which was shown to have a slower time complexity. Our work provides a complete characterization of the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm for all monomial cases, and sheds light on the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.",

The cluster has a ages of approximately 200 million years and contains a rich population of blue straggler stars. Our analysis focuses on the structural and astrophysical parameters of the cluster, including its mass function, size, and mass segregation. We find that the cluster has a larger core radius than previously thought, and that the mass function slope is steeper than the universal IMF slope, indicating that the cluster has undergone some degree of mass segregation. The low-mass stars in the cluster show signs of evaporation, while the high-mass stars are more centrally concentrated. Our results suggest that the cluster is in a state of dynamical evolution, with the more massive stars dominating the cluster's gravitational potential. The presence of blue straggler stars in the cluster indicates that the stellar population is not as old as previously thought, and may have experienced some level of perturbation in its evolution. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of intermediate-age star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and highlight the importance of considering the effects of mass segregation and blue straggler stars in the analysis of stellar populations.",

Our observations reveal that the quasars in our sample have strong thermal emission from warm dust, with FIR-to-radio emission ratios consistent with those of typical star-forming galaxies. We also detect weak Lyα emission in the non-detections, suggesting that the FIR dust heating is likely due to star formation in the host galaxies. We estimate the star formation rate of the MAMBO non-detections to be less than a few hundred M☉ yr−1, while the strong detections have a star formation rate of at least 10^3 M☉ yr−1. We discuss the possibility of active star formation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars and critically assess the implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Our results suggest that huge amounts of warm dust can exist in the host galaxies of optically bright quasars as early as z~6, and that a rapid dust formation mechanism is required. We also find that the FIR luminosities of the detected quasars are about five to ten times stronger than expected from the average SED of local quasars. Finally, we estimate the size of the FIR dust emission region to be about a few kpc and provide a comparison of the SEDs among different kinds of dust emitting sources to investigate the dominant dust heating mechanism.",

The sample consists of 17000 single stars from the updated Geneva-Copenhagen survey. The main known clumps, streams, and branches in the solar neighborhood are identified using various approaches. The evolution of the space velocity field for F and G dwarfs is traced as a function of stellar age. The mean stellar ages of the Wolf 630-alpha Ceti and Hercules streams are shown to be comparable, 4--6 Gyr. No significant differences in the metallicities of stars belonging to these streams have been found. This suggests that these streams owe their origin to a common mechanism. The X-ray luminosity of solar-mass stars in the intermediate age open cluster NGC 752 is also studied. The data indicate that at an age of 1. 9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity of cluster members with M=0. 8-1. 2 Msun is Lx = 1. 3 x 10^28erg s^-1. The median Lx of NGC 752 is consistent, for t > 1 Gyr, to a decaying rate in rotational velocities v_rot ~ t^-alpha with alpha ~ 0. 75. This suggests that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at t ~ 1 Gyr. The relationship between the velocity ellipsoids of Galactic-Disk stars and their ages and metallicities is also analyzed. The dependences of the velocity ellipsoids on ages and metallicities are found to follow power laws with indices that change with metallicity. The appearance of a metallicity dependence of the velocity ellipsoids for thin-disk stars is proposed to be due to the radial migration of stars.",

We suggest that the small angular-scale, high-frequency continuum emission observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting with one another or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium.

The results show that the stars exhibit significant enrichment in nitrogen and magnesium, and to a lesser extent in aluminum and silicon, relative to solar values. The abundances of oxygen and iron are found to be marginally consistent with solar values. The observed abundance patterns are consistent with predictions from models of AGB nucleosynthesis, but discrepancies in the case of some elements and individual stars suggest that additional processes may be at play.

We show that the non-linearity of the interface kinetics leads to a richer phase diagram, with a variety of coarsening regimes that are not observed in the linear case. We demonstrate that the non-linearity can give rise to novel scaling behaviors and scaling exponents, which are not present in the linear case.

In other animals with similar anatomy, this requires the teeth to be replaced due to wear and tear.The team members said they can now begin testing this theory and others regarding the dinosaur's biology and behaviour.Follow Paul on Twitter.",

I think it's rubbish.\"If they made this an open competition where we could all play our under-21s, play players to get fit, close half the stands, and make it more of a competition for development.\"Don't make it just a development competition for Premier League teams when clubs like us work so hard to develop our own players.\"",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Historic England's research is only the tip of the iceberg as it's almost impossible to trace what has happened to every piece of public art since 1945.\"We're making efforts to protect the best examples of post-war public art that still exist, and make sure that it continues to enhance the public realm.\"But we also want to raise awareness of just how vulnerable these works can be and we want the public to help us track down lost pieces.\"Henry Moore's Reclining Figure that was stolen from Hertfordshire in 2005 was worth £3m but police believe it was probably melted down and sold for scrap metal for £1,500.Others have been vandalised, including an abstract steel sculpture by Barry Flanagan in Cambridge.Historic England believes public art is under threat because of the price of scrap metal, local authority funding gaps, pressure from redevelopment and vandalism.In 2012, Wakefield Council removed its Henry Moore sculpture from public display and put it in secure storage because of a spate of thefts.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

It's a sort of benign tumour,\" Dr Dhiware said.\"At first, we couldn't cut it out so we had to use the basic chisel and hammer to take it out.\"Once we opened it, little pearl-like teeth started coming out, one-by-one. Initially, we were collecting them, they were really like small white pearls. But then we started to get tired. We counted 232 teeth,\" she added.The surgery, conducted on Monday, involved two surgeons and two assistants. The team was led by Dr Vandana Thorawade who heads the hospital's ENT (ear, nose and throat) department. Ashik now has 28 teeth.Describing Ashik's case as \"very rare\", Dr Dhiware said she had \"not seen anything like this before in my 30-year career\", but said she was \"thrilled to get such an exciting case\".\"According to medical literature available on the condition, it is known to affect the upper jaw and a maximum of 37 teeth have been extracted from the tumour in the past. But in Ashik's case, the tumour was found deep in the lower jaw and it had hundreds of teeth.\"Ashik's father Suresh Gavai was quoted by the Mumbai Mirror as saying that his son complained of severe pain a month ago.\"I was worried that it may turn out to be cancer so I brought him to Mumbai,\" he said.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

The army said an unknown number of people were missing.There had been concerns over the safety of the site in Colombo, with residents demanding it be cleared.The AFP news agency said about 800 tonnes of waste were added to the Meethotamulla dump every day, and that the government had planned to remove it.\"We heard a massive sound. It was like thunder,\" one resident, Kularathna, told the Reuters news agency. \"Tiles in our house got cracked. Black water started coming in.\"The collapse occurred as many people were marking Aluth Avurudda, or the Sinhalese New Year, a major public holiday across Sri Lanka.Emergency officials told the BBC that up to 20 people may remain buried in their houses, with the Sri Lankan army now co-ordinating the recovery.One disaster emergency official told AFP the death toll would have been higher had many people not left their homes after the fire at the dump, hours before the collapse.One government minister, Harsha De Silva, said in a statement that no more rubbish would be dumped at the site, and would instead be placed in two other sites.It is not clear when the decision is made. Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,\" he said.Last month, a landslide at a rubbish dump in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killed at least 113 people.",

One high-profile leader is monk Ashin Wirathu, who recently used abusive language to describe the UN's special envoy to Myanmar.In December, the UN passed a resolution urging Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) to give access to citizenship for the Rohingya, many of whom are classed as stateless.",

Also there will be questions around the transport infrastructure in the area as well.\"I'm always keen for people to think of the local area when it comes to the possibility for more employment... but it's got to be sensitive and in keeping with the area and it has to have a strong level of local support for me.\"Mr Broome took control of Alton Towers in the 1970s, turning it into a major theme park before selling to the Tussauds Group in 1990.",

The patients, one from the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and the other from Lanarkshire, are both in serious conditions. This brings the total number of botulism cases in Glasgow hospitals to four. The infections are believed to have been caused by contaminated heroin. In response to these new cases, NHS Forth Valley has reported treating a confirmed case in one of its hospitals as well.Dr. Catriona Milosevic, a consultant in public health medicine at NHSGGC, has issued a warning to drug users, urging them to be highly vigilant and seek urgent medical attention if they experience early symptoms such as blurred or double vision, difficulty in swallowing and speaking, and inflammation at the injection site. While it is important for injecting drug users to engage with the available services to help tackle their addictions, such as those provided by pharmacies and drug services, Dr. Milosevic emphasized that immediate medical assistance should be sought if these early symptoms manifest. She also recommended that heroin users avoid injecting the drug into their muscles, as injecting into a vein or smoking it can reduce the risk of botulism.The health board has informed Police Scotland about the new cases, and inquiries are underway to investigate further. Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which attacks the nervous system. It is a serious condition that requires prompt medical intervention. Health officials are working diligently to raise awareness about the risks associated with contaminated heroin use and to ensure that drug users are well-informed and equipped to protect themselves from this potentially life-threatening infection.",

The move is aimed at encouraging community involvement in identifying and reporting these individuals.The PSNI believes that by sharing these images on social media, they can harness the power of public engagement to aid in locating and bringing these suspects to justice. The Wild West-inspired pictures will feature the suspects' faces along with a brief description of their offenses and any relevant details.This unconventional tactic has already generated a buzz among the public, with many expressing support for the initiative. However, there have been concerns raised regarding potential privacy issues and the risk of misidentification. In response, the PSNI has assured the public that all efforts will be made to ensure accuracy and protect individual rights.While the approach may seem unorthodox, the PSNI hopes it will serve as a deterrent to potential offenders who may think they can evade the justice system. By leveraging the power of social media, the police force aims to create a stronger bond with the community and foster a sense of shared responsibility in upholding the law.The PSNI's decision to embrace this new method reflects the evolving landscape of law enforcement and the increasing role of technology in crime prevention. As the initiative rolls out, it remains to be seen how effective it will be in addressing the issue of suspects failing to appear in court, but it is undoubtedly a bold step towards engaging the community in crime prevention and reducing the burden on the justice system.",

However, opponents argue that free movement of people within the EU promotes cultural diversity, economic growth, and knowledge exchange.The UK's relationship with the EU determines its immigration policies to a certain extent. While it must allow EU citizens to enter and reside in the country as part of EU membership, it has some discretion in determining immigration rules for non-EU nationals. The UK operates a points-based system for most migrants from outside the EU, granting control over admission on a case-by-case basis.With negotiations ongoing between the UK and the EU, immigration policies continue to be a point of contention.

The dispute centers around a long-running investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) into a scheme known as Ingenious Media, which aimed to provide tax relief for investments in the film industry. However, HMRC argued that the scheme was primarily a means of tax avoidance rather than genuine investment. The celebrities now face the daunting task of repaying the substantial amounts they had invested, potentially leading to financial difficulties for some individuals. Despite their legal efforts, the court ruling stands, emphasizing the continued determination of HMRC to tackle tax avoidance schemes and ensure compliance with tax regulations.",

The Office for National Statistics revealed that sickness absence in 2022 totaled 137 million working days, equivalent to 4.3 days per employee. This decline represents a significant improvement compared to when records were first kept in 1993, when an average of 7.2 days were lost per worker. The decrease in sick days can be attributed to various factors, including a shift in working culture and the fear of falling behind on workloads. A survey conducted by Aviva UK Health found that 69% of workers admitted to working while unwell due to concerns about accumulating work upon return. However, experts have highlighted the detrimental effects of presenteeism and urged businesses to encourage a supportive environment where employees feel comfortable taking time off when needed. Dr. Doug Wright, medical director at Aviva UK Health, emphasized the adverse impact of presenteeism on productivity and morale, warning that it poses a genuine threat to overall business performance. The declining trend in sickness absence reflects positive progress, indicating that workers are becoming more aware of the importance of their health and employers are adapting their policies to promote well-being in the workplace.",

One individual claimed that their paperwork had been engulfed in a yacht fire, according to the latest reports. The self-assessment tax return deadline, which fell on midnight last Saturday, saw a record number of taxpayers required to submit their returns. With over 11 million people falling under this tax arrangement, the majority opted for online filing, often leaving it until the eleventh hour. Last year, approximately 700,000 individuals missed the deadline, but some were granted leniency by Revenue and Customs due to various valid reasons such as a family death, serious illness, or even flooding.On the final day of last year's deadline, an astounding 557,000 people rushed to file their tax returns in a race against time. Intriguingly, recent analysis conducted by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) suggested that women were more punctual than men in submitting their returns. For every 10,000 tax returns received from men, 394 arrived late, compared to 358 tardy returns from women. The consequences of filing late come with additional penalties, including fines of £10 per day for those who fail to submit their forms by May.Unfortunately, individuals who have not yet registered for online submissions have reached a point of no return, as the opportunity to send in paper tax returns for the 2013-14 tax year has expired since 31st October. Nonetheless, taxpayers can seek assistance in filing their returns through the gov.uk website or by contacting the self-assessment helpline. Additionally, general queries can be addressed by reaching out to the @HMRCcustomers Twitter feed.While this year's deadline has passed, attention now turns to future payment deadlines, which continue to loom ahead.",

With a commitment of £100 million, the initiative aims to support 175,000 girls from impoverished backgrounds to gain access to quality education. The funding will be directed towards countries with the highest rates of girls out of school, including areas in Africa and Asia. According to the DFID, the initiative aims to tackle the gender disparity in education and empower girls to reach their full potential. It is part of a broader global effort to address the barriers that prevent girls from receiving an education and to promote gender equality in educational opportunities. The announcement has been met with praise from advocacy groups and organizations working towards achieving universal education for all children, regardless of gender or socioeconomic background.",

The referendum, held on [date], saw a majority of voters in each district opting to sever ties with the EU. This outcome adds to the growing list of regions across the United Kingdom where the majority has voiced their desire to exit the European Union.The result reflects a strong wave of anti-EU sentiment in Northamptonshire, with many residents expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs and a desire for greater sovereignty and control over national policies. The decision to leave the EU is seen as a protest against what is perceived by some as an out-of-touch political elite and distant institutions.Local officials and campaigners who supported the Leave campaign have hailed the referendum result as a victory for the democratic will of the people. They argue that leaving the EU will open up opportunities for the region to forge its own trade deals and shape its future according to the specific needs and interests of Northamptonshire.On the other hand, proponents of remaining in the EU, including business leaders and advocates of globalization, have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of Brexit on the region. They fear that leaving the EU could disrupt established trade relationships and hinder access to the European single market.With Northamptonshire firmly backing Brexit, attention now turns to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Negotiations with the EU will be crucial in determining the future relationship between Northamptonshire and the European bloc. Meanwhile, political leaders and policymakers will need to focus on addressing the concerns and aspirations of residents to ensure a smooth transition out of the EU and the realization of a prosperous future for the region.",

He told the court that he made five pipe bombs and two home-made explosive devices merely as props for a costume and had no plans to hurt anyone. However, prosecutors said Lyburd had written messages expressing his intention to carry out an attack. He is also accused of possessing a 9mm Glock pistol and 94 hollow-point bullets. The trial is investigating whether Lyburd was truly just preparing a costume or was plotting a violent act at Newcastle College, where he had previously been a student.

The photo showed Steinbrueck on a boat smiling and holding his hand with his middle finger raised.

The first half had failed to provide any goalmouth action, with both sides cancelling each other out. Boreham Wood defender Danny Woodards made a couple of key blocks to deny Maidstone early on. The visitors started the second half brightly and came close through Kevin Lokko and Magnus Okuonghae. As the match looked headed for a draw, Lokko took matters into his own hands in the third minute of injury time. The striker cut inside from the left wing and curled a shot into the top corner from just outside the box. His superb last-gasp effort sent the away fans wild and secured a crucial 1-0 win for Maidstone. The full-time whistle blew moments later to confirm Boreham Wood's painful home defeat.",

Police are appealing for any witnesses who saw motorbikes being ridden on the course between Saturday evening and Sunday morning to contact officers. General manager David Thomson called the incident mindless vandalism that has ruined the course for play. If those responsible are identified, Thomson says the golf club will seek full compensation for the repair costs through the judicial system.

The 25-year-old centre-half has joined the Blues for a fee of around £7m, becoming the club's third signing of the summer. Cahill, who has won six caps for England, made 130 appearances for Bolton after joining from Aston Villa in 2008. He becomes the latest addition to Chelsea's defensive ranks, following the arrivals of David Luiz and Marcos Alonso. The signing of Cahill is seen as a move to strengthen Chelsea's backline, which has been weakened by the departure of experienced defenders such as John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic. Cahill is expected to provide stiff competition for places in the Chelsea defence, with the likes of Cesar Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen, and Antonio Rudiger also vying for spots. The transfer is seen as a coup for Chelsea, who have been looking to strengthen their squad ahead of their return to the Champions League. Cahill will wear the number 24 shirt for Chelsea and is expected to feature in the club's upcoming fixtures.",

The second seeds came from a set down to beat the French pair Stephane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer 4-6 6-1 7-6 (8-6) in a thrilling match. Reid, who won the singles title at the Australian Open earlier this year, described the victory as a \"dream come true\" and praised his partner Hewett for his excellent play. The duo had to fight back from 5-0 down in the final set tiebreak, showing great determination and resilience. Reid and Hewett's victory marks a significant moment for wheelchair tennis in the UK, and they will hope to build on this success in the future.

Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure.

One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

I usually go down this very street to get my latest supply, but today I felt another reason to do so, one that I had neglected mostly. Walking down, I see a black, burnt looking book that took my entire attention away. It looked out of place with the grimy look in this city, which intrigued and feared me at the same time. So being a good samaritan and thief I took the book in a natural way to not arise any suspicion, and read it. \" Holy smokes... \" I gasped, awing at the book' s content.

However, instead of reaching for my wallet I just grab the book out and tossed it to him. \" Trust me, more much more than this sh*t. \" I said, sitting down as I opened the plastic bag and greedily sniffing its content.",

A set of goggles hid his eyes from the harsh polar glare while the heavy thermal suit kept the worst of the howling winds at bay. Lieutenant Katya Ryzhkina stood besides him, equally wrapped beneath thick layers of wool and thermals. A wisp of blonde hair had escaped her suit' s hood and billowed about, tendrils of ice forming on the strands. \" Sorry to leave this ice cube? \" Deshler asked over his suit' s comm-unit. * \" No, not really, \" * answered Ryzhkina. * \" My ancestors came from Siberia, or so I' m told. They were Cossacks. \" * Deshler nodded, aware that the gesture was lost in the suit' s fur lined hood. This world was a far cry from his childhood home of Ryerson with its expansive forests and numerous rivers. Its polar regions were paltry, temperate things compared to Conarky' s, and although the taiga to the south made a welcome change of pace it was a poor substitute for Ryerson' s mixed forests. Without speaking, they both turned and started back towards the waiting dropship, its cargo already loaded and ready to go. The life of a mercenary was one of impermanence, cast adrift by fate and chance to follow the drum. They' d seen scores of worlds, each more different than the last. Who knew if they' d ever return to this one?",

My watch ticked just past four when I got there. A beautiful place, to be sure - isolated, expensive - cold, too. The cold was the problem, and I was the solution. I trudged up the steps, leaving footprints in light powder, and knocked. And knocked. And knocked. I began to get uneasy then. A night without heat could get bad in the mountains, and even though I had made it there as fast as I could, I got uneasy. I had spoken to the client just before eleven the night before - it had taken me a good five hours to reach the mountain home, even while pushing the speed limit as much as I could. Long story short, no one was home. I found the problem quickly - a few wires got crossed the wrong way the furnace, and I was on my way. I did n' t really notice anything was wrong until I got back to the city. I got progressively more worried the closer to home I got - my girlfriend had n' t text me so much as a \" good morning \". And there was no one on the road. No one. Not unusual coming out of the mountains, but in the city... lights were on, traffic signals directed nothing, and I could n' t see any signs of inexplicable disasters. It' s been silent since then.

He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself. Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie' s car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I' d taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead. It was n' t the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me. The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I' d cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I' d made the last hour of many men' s lives slightly better. I could n' t imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make. Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up. Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work. -- - Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer' s cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face. He was crying. I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \" I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry.

Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life.

The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end.

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza.

His heart leaped into his throat as the snail was thrown at him with much more force than necessary. Luckily, he managed to catch her.

Each planet of the federation was granted the ability to drop the entirety of one species off onto Terra to free themselves of the burden of their existence on their own world. Terra was considered a *Death World*. As in it could n' t sustain life for long periods of time, due to the general entropy of our solar system, and the fact that earth can only handle so much life at once from packing it full of these *useless* species. The Galactic Federation would cause mass extinction events to \" cleanse \" the planet when it got too packed, essentially a cosmic trashbin for the Galactic Federation. Humanity really was a luck of the draw. After the last M. E. E. of the Galactic Federation, as we know mammals came to be the dominant type of animal on the planet, eventually giving way to the rise of *Homo Sapiens*. Humans were lucky. One in a trillion, usually the beings of energy who lead the Galactic Federation gift the evolutionary path to sentience, and intelligence to a world, but we were the first who came to be in a natural fashion, quite literally diamond in the rough, the treasure in the world of intergalactic trash. And now that we were one of them, *The Federation were frightened to see what we could do. *",

As hope seemed to fade into twilight, and a smile always a breath away, John had given up. He knew he was n' t going to be one of those irresponsible people that made a rash decision and called it quits, leaving sadness and debt in his wake. He was going to do this right; and so he planned. His struggles surely were not from a lack of trying. At the very least he could hold onto that thought until the end. After trying for years to battle past his descending mind, he had finally gotten his life in order. The passing eyes continually reaffirmed that he was successful in every avenue he chose, but it was never the pair that mattered; his own. For every long forgotten friend that he ran into saying \" You look great, John! \" and wanting to know how he managed to stay single, he truly was doing great. He could never tell them the real answer to their question though. How could he possibly bring another person into his life if he was n' t sure he was going to continue living it? It always came down to just another person he would eventually disappoint. Choosing to leave as small a wake as possible, he turned away from those he feared would get too close. Today marked his final stand. One last shot at trying to see the sunrise as a welcoming sight. With his finances taken care of, and relationships closed on a good note, he knew he was finally free to make any decision that he chose. It was a freeing feeling, one he knew would be fleeing as soon as tomorrow. Bucket list waiting on his dresser, John woke up and lit the cigarette that had been in his desk drawer for twenty years, thinking, \" Today may finally be a good day. \"",

The modern weapons of war were tactical and humanitarian in nature. A half-century old rifle was brutally effective, clunky and inhumane. All militaries were required to keep their firearms current to within ten years to avoid unnecessary suffering. Modern guns, bombs and planes, like the one I was in had their advantages not in power but in range, reliability and stealth. The soft blinking of the light told me to prepare. That was a farce; I did n' t need to prepare. There was n' t a parachute to drop me. That would just make me easier to hit on the way down.

Before you only had to tap into the one labeled \" new \" few times in a decade, but when you started to scrape the bottom of the \" recycled \" chamber about a century ago the new ones had been your main source of souls. And new souls were quite... unpredictable. You did n' t like using them. The art of weaving new souls had been long lost. Nobody thought there ever would be need for more. 10 billion souls had been such a ridiculous amount to begin with, so to think that wouldn' t be enough was talk for lunatics, not for sensible ministry men. But humans had managed to surprise you all. Perhaps the celestial body they were on would give out before the limit would be reached. Perhaps there would be another asteroid. Perhaps there would be a new plague. More wars. But it was all just wishful thinking. The humans had shown tremendous capabilities to survive from things meant to be their doom. To your annoyance. Slicing souls into two, sometimes three or even four, pieces had become a sort of a sience experiment for you. Humans were always so excited when they got identical offsprings, so it had been a win win situation. Of course when you recycled the soul as one later on, you got some side effects, but they were still viable souls and it had given you more time. But now it was impossible to postpone the decision. You were out of tricks. It was excitement you felt rather than despair. Your burden would be finally taken away from you and perhaps something new and better would come out of this last action of yours. You pick the last of the new souls with you. No more for Earth. No more for humans. You look into another place, another plane, another time and you smile.",

We celebrated by spending a night on a picnic blanket at the top of the hill. She held me close before telling me we would always be close. That summer, we both took jobs at the local supermarket. I was in inventory, she was a cashier. We would giggle near the milk aisle, admiring ourselves in the reflection of the glass, before our supervisor would catch us. During university, we lived in separate dormitories, but not too far away from each other. I would sometimes sleep over at her place, sometimes she would stay at mine. We both felt it. Holding hands, I knew she felt it. It was real. But then she got pregnant. A guy named Stuart Sanchez Garcia claimed he was the father. I never saw her until she dropped out three months later. She confirmed that he was the father. The day that my face will dry from my tears will be the happiest day ever. But until that day, I will have to concede love to her partner, Stuart. She would eventually marry him. She had the child. They had another one. Ten years down the line, they moved away, so I could no longer see them again. I was in Colorado. They were in Costa Rica. I never forgot about here. But I always. Felt out of place. It was by chance, on a holiday, years later that I saw them. Three kids, a smile and another child on its way. Their love was unbreakable.

I was almost late, but walked into the meeting just as everyone was getting settled in. As I stood there, a couple of people looked at me and then a couple more started staring and snickering. Bob finally asked me, \" Uhhh, what' s up with your pants? \" I did n' t know what he meant, but I looked down, and that' s when I realized I accidentally smeared chocolate from the muffin all over my tan khakis. Some of the ladies quipped, \" You really need a woman in your life, Tim, to help you do your laundry; you' re so helpless \". Ughh, I went down to the bathroom to try and clean this mess before it set in too bad. I slipped out of my pants and started wiping the spots with wet paper towels. I got distracted by some important email that came across my smart phone. I sent a couple of carefully crafted replies and headed back into the meeting. When I walked in everyone was laughing and facepalming at me. I looked down, and that' s when I realized I did n' t remember to dry my pants under the hand dryer. They were still wet from the water. \" Hey Tim, did you wet your pants!? \"... everyone was laughing. The boss said \" Tim, I' ve had enough of your nonsense, you' re fired! \" I immediately sat up in bed in a cold sweat. This whole thing had just been a dream. I threw back my covers and sheets, and that' s when I realized I did n' t have any pants on.",

The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain. He quickly dozed off. -- - In the middle of a pleasant dream about dogs made of butter, Michigan awoke with a start.

Also, I did the unthinkable, so I' d appreciate a towel, a deck of cards, and three Canadian toonies, \" replied Michigan. The man, who Michigan surmised to be the young boy' s father, performed an almost beautifully timed double take. \" What do you mean, you did the unthinkable? \" \" Sir.

I understand that this is against protocol and even against nature, but the solution I propose is protocol Black Pearl \", says Gardner. A murmur of confusion goes around the room. Gardner clicks a button on his remote, and the first slide to pop up is a centuries old wanted poster of what looked to be a madman. \"This, is Captain Jack Sparrow an- \"\"He' s only a legend!

He was also one of the best captains to ever live. We also are able to resurrect him. \", Gardner finishes. A councilman stood up in the front, \"Even if we actually believed this, how would a 17th century Caribbean pirate possibly help us with the fight against the might of the Klingons? \"It was at this point Gardner smiled, which threw everyone off balance. \"The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem. \", he said smugly.",

        "text": "*From the memoirs of Alexis Greybeard the Ultimate* Prologue: \" Why I developed a self casting spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance. \" It' s very simple. I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

His eyes were always dialaated and he spoke with a sense of passion about the most obscure things. Things that most people would n' t see any beauty in he always felt the need to point out. I' ll be honest. Usually I did n' t get it. Id politely agree and try to get back to atudying without too much conversation. He was n' t really my type. I guess I was shallow back then. Anyways one night: he comes home late. It must have been around 2: 30. He seemed very distraught. He opened the fridge and dropped his bag. I pretended to be asleep and noticed how he suspiciously watched me as he took a small water bottle out of his back pack filled with a glowing neon pink fluid. He put the bottle in the fridge and started shuffling through the drawers like he was desperately looking for something. He kept looking at me every few seconds so I kept my eyes closed to avoid detection and within a few minutes I hard the door slam. I quickly rose from my bed, throwing the covers off my body and moved towards the fridge in the dark room. Just before I reached the fridge he stepped out of the dark corner towards me. He had n' t left. He looked at me with a blank stare. \" Thought you were sleeping. \" He said calmly. \" I heard the door slam it woke me up \" I said. A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face. Noses almost touching. He cocked his head to the side and tried to kiss me. \" What the fuck bro? \" I pushed him away. He back stepped and stumbled into the darkness again. And again he moved back into the light. Slower this time. With a devious, sinister smile he stared into my soul as if he were about to take it from me. To be continued.. If anybody wants me to",

It was a beautifully decorated office in a mansion overlooking Beverly Hills. He poked around a bit, but there was no evidence of anything being taken. Apparently, the killer was only there to take a life. An hour passed as the coroner and crime scene investigators came and went. The Lieutenant sat in the office chair recently occupied by the deceased. He passed the time, puffing on his cigar, mulling over the facts. HQ always assigned him the weird ones, and this one was weirder than most. He stubbed out his cigar as Sergeant Baker entered the room. \" We' re all done here. Oh, and Mrs. Columbo called and asked if you could bring home some milk. \" Columbo sighed. Milk was just what he needed to settle his queasy stomach.

I wanted to ask if it would still give me powers, but Mom shushed me. There were a lot of big, confusing words, but Doctor Coleman seemed happy about it and said that this would work.

Currently no nation has agreed to take in ten thousand displaced people who currently reside in displaced persons camps in Brazil who have made moves to close the camps and move the people on stating \" we believe we have no responsibility to these people and that the nations that placed their ancestors in Africa should repatriate them \". The meetings will start Monday despite expert predictions that negotiations will stall due to U.S. vetoes.",

His hands were trembling so violently that a drip of sweat shook itself loose and rolled into his right eye.

So we had to cancel it midway through. No big deal. The second wedding had gone perfectly – that is, until one of the musicians tripped over an amplifier cord and started an electrical fire. Unfortunate, to be sure, but nothing too bad. So we tried again, and again. Wedding after wedding. This was now our 30th wedding. We had to cancel it because I had a panic attack.",

My legs twist first, their natural angle bent backwards, hair receding as the change progressed up my body, until I was bare on the forest floor again. My mind, as the humans called it, had retained most of the information I had gathered since my first night, and I had plenty of time to add to it. Granted the markings had changed from letters to their own unique system, and the pillars were replaced with grey and clear. I had the foresight to leave myself a pack for this, and hurriedly changed. While the nip in the air would not kill me, another seeing me with no coverings in winter would bring out... unwelcome attention. My plan was the same as every full moon, walk around the city that was beginning to encroach my forest, and I jinxed myself by believing the night would be mishap free. As it were and often is, there was another plan in place. The smell came first. While dulled, it was still sharper than most of my current-kin. Fear, especially, was potent enough to smell even among the cold smell of forest. Instinct kicked in, as I recognized it as the fear of something young. Something that, no matter what I looked like, was encoded in me to protect. I was already running toward the source when the scream made it easier to pinpoint.",

Like the heat of the day erasing a morning snow, the void melted the living tissue into a trickle of nothingness adding to the vacuum. The feeling had consumed most of his arms and legs and had begun to encompass his head. As it delved deeper, he got progressively duller. This new sensation, much like being sleepy, caused his thoughts to come much slower than normal and made him less attuned to his situation. At this point, much of his torso had been swallowed up.

As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes. I stepped into the bridge and was silently greeted by my ship mate, Sebastian. He was a quiet man. But that was all part of the business. I sat down on my chair and gazed up again.

Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time.

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated.

Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel.

He did n' t eat everyday any more, the last time he ate was a week ago, it was a shitty burger to calm his nerves. A heavy knock came from the door. Oskar got up, hearing his leg whine under his weight. He looked through the peep hole; a man with a drooping face, it was almost like the parts around his face had melted. He undid the bolt and chain, he opened the door. \" What do you want? \" The man smiled, half his teeth black and the other half yellow. \" Orion. \" *Bloody codewords. * I thought. I pulled a small briefcase from under my pillow, I clicked the button and it made a little click, popping the case open. Inside, a white robe. I sighed. I handed over the brief-case. In return, he handed me a stack of fifty dollar bills. Almost a nineteen hundred dollars. \" Good. Good bye, citizen. \"",

The people would now be willing, if not eager, to give up their hard-won freedoms in exchange for safety and security. It was, as the saying goes, the beginning of the end. We have all sacrificed more than we would wish. We have all lost family members in the struggle for freedom. We have lost our homes. We have lost our jobs. We have lost our entire way of life. Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III. During an evacuation attempt by his bodyguards from the besieged White House, he was shot and killed by U.S. Military forces. His crime was suspicion of advocating freedom. \" My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my people. \" This is Radio Free America, signing off.",

His eyesight also teetered on the edge of darkness, his skin was a pale white from bloodloss and his legs shook as if he had just squatted over his max by a few hundred tons. \" Art thou ready to face your doom forsaken traveler?! \" The ominous voice was punctuated by the sideways slash of an impossibly large sword.

Thousands of people come here, to escape. They come here to have a care-free night. When I snap my fingers, magic happens. Everyone lets loose and something deep down lets all their cares go and allows them to truly feel what i feel. I was on to my last song of the night when suddenly in the back of the crowd you could see everyone slowly stop dancing one by one. It was as if everyone were goats, you know those goats where they get scared and just stand there. Something was making them do this. People shifted from enjoying themselves to staring at each other and thinking negatively. There was a lady in the back who was clapping her hands and it seemed like the louder and longer she clapped the more people stopped dancing. This continued until every single person in the crowd was just standing here and whispering to each. Who was this lady? Why was she doing this? Slowly she came through the parting crowd and reached her hand out to me. \" Hello, my name is Judgment \" she uttered.",

It would be painful, though maybe with a chance to live afterward. Perhaps face-first instead, so there' s less pain but absolutely no hope of survival. Maybe make a spectacle of it and do a belly-flop. I' m scared being here, yet there' s also a beauty to it that draws me back.

And that was how he was able to talk to me. As he lay dying, he told me it was up to me to save my planet, as he was now unable to complete his mission. All I needed was to tell him what I needed to fight of the impending intergalactic threat until more of his people could arrive to save us. I knew what I needed, and it was almost too perfect as I saw myself soaring through the clouds, fighting incredible battles and saving all the people below. I was going to be a hero. I was going to be famous. I was going to get laid! It must have been my rush to get the words out. Or, perhaps, Mr. Wish-alien did n' t pick the right accent when he learned English. But, 2 days later, as the alien force was entering the Earths atmosphere, I put my powers to work, hoping to steer the aliens away. I hoofed it up to the ship to engage the enemy. All I could see was red as I began the fight. I keep chewing on it over and over again in my mind, how could that stupid alien dooo this to me? Somehow, I was able to drive them back until help arrived. I was branded a hero! And as the aliens arrived on the capital to meet with the president and myself, the leader wished to be able to talk to us.

I' m not even sure if there can be a real ending, not until The End, when entropy has won. Everything seems to be a part of the cosmic narrative, like a current built from rushing bits of water that have no way of knowing if they will reach an ocean or a farm or a lake. In that sense, this is not an end - it is tiny compared to the cosmic background. But that does not mean it is truly small. He feared this was truly the end. Not of everything, but of this world. We were the universe, and while the actual matter that composed us could never be destroyed, I did not understand what would happen to our knowledge. That' s what stopped me. Matter... it is conserved, along with energy. But knowledge... knowledge is never conserved. It might not be infinite, but it is never conserved. Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor. A small victory for life, if it ever truly fought death. But a huge victory for me, in my own role in humanity' s fight against death.",

No, it was better for the people to be snuffed out suddenly, rather than have the human race descend into an orgy of rape and looting in its final days. I made the choice for the benefit of mankind. As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA.

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony.

Once every living entity has forgotten about you, you vanish forever. Nobody knows what happens to these souls. I guess it' s kind of like dying again. Bill was the previous Grim Reaper, but the last living person who remembered him was dying. Bill knew this, so he decided to train the next person to become the new Grim Reaper. The next person was me. Now, after lots and lots of training, Bill has vanished and I am the new Grim Reaper. When you inevitably die, I will be there to claim your soul.

In the faint reflection I could see tears still streaming down her face as we drove in near silence, Seattle fading away behind us. My eyes flick to the child seat still strapped into the back, empty once again. I do n' t want to keep doing this, a small voice says in my mind. There is nothing I want more than for us to have the family Katie has always dreamed of, that I have always dreamed of too. The family that we ca n' t afford to get through medical means.. instead, we' re forced to navigate the murky waters of courts and CPS and social workers. We open our house and our hearts and each time we get back the same verdict: our house is not a home yet, and we are n' t real parents. We have cared for five children so far, and none of them got to be ours. As we near our exit, I notice Katie wiping her eyes with her free hand. She turns to look at me, the pain still clear and evident in her brown eyes. \" I' m not ready to give up, \" she says almost defiantly, as if she knows what I' m thinking. I keep my eyes fixed on the road, and nod slowly. \" I know, \" I answer her. Not knowing what else to say but feeling like I must say something, I add, \" I love you, Katie. \" \" I love you too, Jessica. \" She sounds distant and vacant, and I see she' s gone back to looking out the window and is off some place in her own mind. She always does this when she grieves -- she withdraws. It' s like watching someone drown and there' s nothing you can do to stop it. As we pull into our driveway, I squeeze her leg again. I am very tired, but like Katie, I' m not truly willing to give up yet either.",

As I slowly opened my eyes underneath the water, I turned my gaze upward towards the others. There they were, suspended in the air, only a few inches from the surface of the water. Now, my mind didn' t really process this. At first, I was waiting for them to fall! But, eventually, my breath failed me, forcing me to resurface. As I quietly stared at the other kids mocking me, I hear the splash of water behind me. \"Wow, seriously? Only three seconds?! \"I didn' t really get it at the time, but their tone upset me so I decided to try again. And that time, I finally noticed. The frozen figures of kids greeted me as I dove. When I waved my hand in front of one' s face? No reaction. And so, being a kid, there was only one thing to do when you' re surrounded by jerks. Removed the swimming shorts of a kid. Went in front of another and urinated. Moved a kid' s hand onto another' s butt. I recall the ensuring chaos to be hilarious, but I ca n' t remember what really happened.

The President laughed and smiled over the hum of the ships. When the dropships hovered at eye level, the bay doors fell down. A couple dozen drones disguised as elves poured out. They ran, leaped, and danced through the crowds, handing out sweets to every out-stretched hand. One elf soared next to my window, tapping on the glass and waving. I waved back. The hot chocolate in my mug kept my hands warm and I found myself smiling. The giant projection of the country' s benevolent leader, the street with lights of every colors, the people crammed shoulder to shoulder, happily sharing each others' warmth. It was a picture perfect holiday. A small girl tugged at the arm of my sweater. \" Let me finish this cocoa. \" I whispered to her. She nodded and skipped to the front room. I drank what was left, putting the mug in the sink. She was already waiting at the door, holding my coat for me. \" Let' s go. \" We walked to the cemetery.

As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, a warm Spring breeze belied the shuddering forces soon to be unleashed... Eyes fixed on his hapless target, the elderly man prepared to explosively transform the potential to the kinetic. In his long fingers he rolled a hard, unyielding baseball. Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

In its beauty he wanders. The asbestos lined walls are cracked and weathered. The ornamental roof cracked and rotted allowing the moon to light the room. The concert hall a relic of the past; an inescapable acknowledgement of something once lost. Verbal communication caused the most hardship. Businesses temporarily came to standstill, but the internet soon accounted for most of, if not all interaction.

The world had moved on, but the inescapable human tendency towards music left an unfillable void. So here he sat, a relic of the past, clinging on to something long forgotten. But this was home.

The first artillery shells shook the ground while we still were loading up the food and ammunition. \" Return fire! Load up faster, crew! In one minute we' re taking off to the uncharted sea! \" Cannonballs, artillerystrikes and bullets were exchanged, we suffered one casualty, but we got out of range of the enemy. \" Well done, guys! I think we did it! We should celebrate... \" \" Paul, would you please give your brother a piece of your chocolate? And when you are done, please throw away these boxes and clean up this mess! \" This is my first time trying, hope it was n' t too awful. Criticism is appreciated.",

After some time, you notice certain names that appear more often than any others; /u/Luna_LoveWell, /u/Lexilogical, even /u/Draxagon and /u/imchrishansen_. There used to be a lot more, until one day they started dropping like flies. I have n' t had a lead on this case in months, but popular users are still disappearing right and left. It ca n' t be a coincidence, someone must be eliminating their competition. It' s a good thing that a guy like me blends in, otherwise I might find myself becoming the next victim. Until then, I have to try and find the killer. /u/Luna_LoveWell is the prime suspect, most of her stories end with death and despair. The chief is a big fan of her work, so he' s asked me to look into other users. I do n' t think we have any solid evidence against her, most of the stories on here end that way anyways. /u/Lexilogical seems friendly to everyone, almost too friendly for a mod. There' s an angle here, something I' m missing. Nothing seems fishy about her stories, though. I do n' t think she would kill over something like this... /u/Draxagon has been pretty active lately, spitting out lots of stories. He might be too new though, these murders started a while ago. Still, I' ll keep tabs on him. /u/imchrishansen_ has caught my attention lately, could be our perp. That recent story about plagiarism seemed to come straight out of a psychotic mind. But it' s Chris Hansen, who fights crimes, not commits them... I call up the chief and tell him that I' m going to follow one last lead. This guy has been trying to distract us all along, I need to see what he' s up to. /u/Fractal_Death, you' ve got some explaining to do. ( I' m sure that I' ve missed plenty of active members, but I' ve only been around for a few days. I made my choices based only on what I' ve seen lately. )",

        "text": "Has anyone read the essay arguing that Ender' s Game is \" pornography \", in the sense that it cares more about repeatedly satisfying the reader' s desires ( \" fetishes \" ) for wish-fulfillment and self-pity than about a more deeply satisfying plot? Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

Nothing much but a few twisted trees, low stone wall, and a figure off in the distance. I squelch my way across the marsh towards the figure. The crow still watching my, hopping behind me. I try to run over the events of last night; \" Went pub with Jim. Got a kebab. Smoked. Went to the off license, then... urgh \" I grumbled out loud to no one but myself and maybe the crow. As I got closer to the figure I noticed they stood on a dock of a large lake, lost in the gloom and sogginess of the marsh. A small wooden boat, with peeling paint, bobbed in the water. \" Excuse me mate? \" #, I said in my least hungover manner. \" You mind telling me where I am, or how to get back to home? \" Without turning, the figure spoke. \" Long way from home here. I can get you somewhere, if you got a few coins \" I dug around in my pocket, finding the two pounds I had. \" Got a couple quid, if you can give me a lift. Hell, I do n' t expect home, just not here. Somewhere with people... well, more people. And an off license \". He held out his hand. \" Just jump in the boat, and we' ll get going \" they said.

He went and laid some cable, pinched a load, sat on the porcelain throne. *Call it what you will*. He took a large one. Course, he forgot that he did it during maintenance time, so naturally, the toilet got clogged. Then overflowed. Of course no one noticed since the janitors always take their smoke break early. So, only after the service did anyone notice. It also happened to be the day our mayor decided to come by and inspect the school. Of course it was a disappointing mess, so he went home smelling of turds and bleach. I guess if there is anything obvious about small rural towns, it' s that they will only have one school, and more often than not, one set of bars and a stripper club. That used the same brand of bleach. And smelled of turds. So, in all honesty, when we heard that the mayor had been shot by his wife because she allegedly claimed that he had been at the stripper club that smelt of turds and bleach, we all knew who had caused it. *Fucking Winston. *",

Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking.

I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all.

He had 10 sisters and 5 brothers all younger than him and as the only adult of the family he had inherited it all. His father and mother were of modest upbringing and now they languished in jail. They had orchestrated the largest and most horrific crime in recent memory. It seemed only fitting that Marc would get the money. His father - Samuel and mother - Jane had dinned with Presidents and Royalty. They were as indispensable members of high society. They could be relied upon to provide full coverage of waking periods, at a price of course, to the key heads of state for the wealthiest nations on earth. This ensured that the key elected government officials could work relentlessly around the clock without rest. Marc and Jane Rebus were incredibly rich. And now they were in prison. Their eldest son looking after 15 siblings. It seemed fair that he would inherit except for the fact that having spent his life under sedation, he had the appearance of fully grown man but all the capacity of a newborn child. It would not be appropriate for him to be the sole custodian of his blighted siblings when they too had not seen a single day awake.",

At the end of this rundown, the judge from on high looked at me, his eyes a color I could not comprehend, and handed me a computer. I took it from his hands. This must be heaven, I thought. It was, for a little while, if nothing else. The computer gave me access to an internet of thought, a web of ideas that made perfect sense, where people were civil and appreciative. It was unlike anything I had ever thought possible. As I clicked a link that promised the solution to world peace, the screen went black. So even heaven is not without its problems. I walked back to the judge, a long trek through barren cloudscape. As soon as I appeared to him, he motioned me toward a hallway assembled from rainbows. A banner above the hall read \"Tech Support \". It was an Earthly feeling, I chuckled. A blast from the past. The hallway was not long. It was more like medium length. It must be empty because they' re so quick. Makes sense that heaven perfected tech support, I remember thinking. At the end of the multi-hued path, there was a warm brick foyer. I stepped in, and a red door appeared behind me, sealing me in. **WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? ** Well, I was on the computer and the screen went black, I explained. **PLEASE HOLD. ** There was an indistinct music that filled the room, and wormed into my ears. A lilting, ethereal tone, constantly pulling away. I hope one day I escape this room. It has been eighty years. And the music has still not approached me. It remains an ambrosia I can not digest. I laid the computer on the bricks at year ten. By year thirty I had smashed it to pieces. By year fifty, I had eaten all the pieces. It is gone, and I am still here. This must be hell.",

It was a crude image, a digital representation of male genitalia, sent by an unknown sender. Zorgon's tentacles curled in revulsion as he tapped the communication console, attempting to establish contact with the humans. \"This must be a mistake,\" he muttered to himself, his alien physiology struggling to comprehend such an obscene gesture.

Zorgon tried his best to remain composed, his many eyes fixated on the human's bewildered expression. \"Greetings, Earthling.

The human blinked in surprise, clearly unaware of the inappropriate message that had been sent. \"Captain Zorgon, I...\" the human stammered, searching for words. \"I assure you, that image does not represent the sentiments of the entire human race.\" Zorgon's tendrils twitched as he tried to process this information. \"You mean... this was not an intentional act of hostility?\" he inquired, a glimmer of hope emerging in his alien heart. The human shook their head vigorously. \"No, Captain. It was a regrettable act from an individual who does not represent our collective desire for peace.\" Relief washed over Zorgon, his multiple mouths forming a grateful smile. \"I am glad to hear that, Earthling. We were prepared to respond with force, but now... perhaps there is still a chance for understanding.\" The human nodded, a newfound determination emanating from their eyes. \"We will do whatever it takes, Captain, to make amends for this unfortunate misunderstanding.

As I cautiously explored, I stumbled upon a hidden room, illuminated by a single dim light bulb. Inside, I discovered a group of individuals engaged in a secret meeting, discussing plans that could alter the course of history. My curiosity got the better of me, and I foolishly attempted to gather evidence of their wrongdoing. But I was careless and knocked over a stack of crates, alerting the group to my presence. Panic set in as they cornered me, their menacing faces illuminated by the flickering light. In a desperate bid for escape, I sprinted through corridors and climbed rickety stairs, my heart pounding in my chest. As I reached the roof, I found myself trapped with no way out. The only option left was to jump. Fear coursed through my veins as I leaped into thin air, the world spinning around me. Thoughts of loved ones and unfinished dreams flashed before my eyes, but there was no turning back. The ground rushed towards me, growing larger and more menacing with each passing second. Hindsight filled my mind, regret weighing heavy on my soul. I wished I had never stepped foot into that warehouse, that I had listened to the warnings and stayed away. The realization of my impending doom struck me, and I closed my eyes, bracing for the impact. The final moments seemed to stretch into eternity, a mixture of terror and acceptance engulfing me.

In this strange, timeless space, I could not move on to the afterlife until my memory faded from the minds of the living. A profound sadness washed over me as I understood the magnitude of my predicament. How long would it take for me to be forgotten? Days? Years? Centuries? I longed for release, to escape the stagnant confines of purgatory. I walked aimlessly through the ethereal haze, desperate for any sign of life or connection. But there was nothing—no other souls, no flicker of hope. Time lost its meaning as I traversed the empty expanse, grappling with the emptiness that hung in the air. Memories of my past life gradually began to fade, slipping through my ethereal fingers like smoke. I yearned to hold onto fragments of my existence, to be remembered by someone, anyone. But the world moved on, as it had always done, heedless of my presence in this purgatorial limbo. Days turned into months, and months into years, yet the chains of purgatory remained unbroken. I grew weary of this timeless purgatory, the weight of solitude becoming unbearable. Dreams of the living haunted my ethereal nights, whispering promises of release and resurrection. I craved the taste of life once more, to feel the warmth of the sun upon my face and the embrace of a loved one. But in purgatory, such dreams were cruel taunts from a distant realm. And so, I lingered, a forgotten soul in the desolate realm of purgatory, hoping for the day when my memory would fade and release would finally come.",

I am no longer the fearless warrior I once was; instead, I am a single dad, trying to provide a safe and loving home for my daughter. Gone are the days of battling dark sorcerers and vanquishing mythical beasts. Now, my battles consist of soothing a crying baby and mastering the art of changing diapers with swift precision.

I had always been fascinated with ninjas and their mysterious ways, and now I had the chance to witness their existence firsthand. As I ventured deeper into the land, I noticed something peculiar. The people seemed to be familiar with the concept of ninjas, and their depiction in 1980s media appeared to be accurate. It was as if movies, TV shows, and books had accurately captured the essence of these stealthy warriors. The villagers spoke of the ninjas' agility, their mastery of weapons, and their deadly combat skills. I couldn't help but feel a surge of joy knowing that my favorite childhood movies had depicted them so authentically. Everywhere I looked, there were stories of ninjas infiltrating castles, engaging in epic sword fights, and disappearing into thin air. The people's admiration for these warriors was evident, and I marveled at how the tales from my time had found their way into history. I approached a group of villagers, eager to learn more about their perception of ninjas. They spoke with reverence, their eyes shining with awe as they recounted legendary tales of ninja clans and their secret techniques. It was surreal to witness the seamless integration of 1980s media portrayal with the actual historical accounts of ninjas. I soaked in the knowledge, exploring ancient scrolls and practicing basic ninja techniques under the guidance of a wise sensei. I became convinced that somehow, the artists and writers of the past had tapped into a hidden well of truth, capturing the very essence of the ninja spirit. With newfound respect for the power of storytelling, I knew that I had a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between past and future. I would gather tales of these authentic ninjas and bring them back to my time, ensuring that their legacy would endure for generations to come.",

The aliens didn't impose strict rules or enforce their authority. They simply coexisted with humanity. People went to work, children went to school, and the daily routines remained intact. The aliens, known as the Zrakarians, blended seamlessly into society. They looked like ordinary humans, apart from their luminescent eyes. They held ordinary jobs, pursued hobbies, and even frequented local cafes. It was as if they were one of us, except for their advanced technology. They shared their knowledge freely, aiding in scientific breakthroughs and medical advancements. The world prospered under the Zrakarians' guidance. Some suspected mind control or hidden agendas, but there was no evidence of manipulation. The aliens seemed genuinely interested in our well-being. With time, fear and skepticism dissipated, replaced by acceptance and gratitude. Humanity and aliens coexisted side by side, creating a harmonious world where progress knew no bounds. And so, life carried on, for better or worse, with the aliens as our silent partners in the pursuit of a brighter future.",

These were the personal accounts of war survivors, haunting reminders of the price paid for peace. Opening the first journal, I was transported to the trenches of World War I, where a young soldier shared his fears and dreams amidst the chaos of battle. His words bore witness to the horrors he witnessed, the friendships forged, and the fragile hope that clung to his heart. The next journal revealed the struggles of a nurse during the Vietnam War, her tender hands stained by the wounds of others. She wrote of the anguish she felt each time a life slipped away, but also of the solace she found in providing comfort amid the devastation. Her words painted a vivid picture of the resilience of the human spirit, even in the darkest of times. Moving forward in time, I discovered the harrowing accounts of a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. This journal, filled with anguish and despair, spoke of the unimaginable violence and loss experienced by an entire nation. Yet, amidst the despair, there were glimmers of hope, as the writer described acts of kindness and compassion that offered a flicker of light in the midst of darkness. As I continued reading, I encountered the poignant memoir of a soldier who had served in the Gulf War. The journal chronicled the internal conflicts he faced, torn between duty and the personal cost of warfare. His reflections on the futility of violence and the longing for peace echoed across the pages, a heartfelt plea for humanity to rise above its self-destructive tendencies. Each journal unveiled a unique perspective on the horrors of war, written by hands that had known both fear and courage. They spoke of sacrifice, loss, and the indomitable human spirit that somehow manages to endure. While the conflicts and locations varied, a common thread of resilience and a longing for peace united them all.",

The possibilities seemed endless, from flight and teleportation to mind reading and invincibility. The world held its breath as the clock struck midnight, signaling the official commencement of power selection. Millions of voices simultaneously whispered their desires into the universe. As the choices were made, a peculiar phenomenon began to unfold. The more people selected a particular power, the weaker it became. It was as if the collective energy of humanity divided the potency. Powers like telekinesis and telepathy, initially highly sought after, lost their luster as they became diluted among the masses. The world quickly realized the consequences of this peculiar rule. With each passing minute, powers that had once been awe-inspiring became mundane in their weakness. The early adopters, those who dared to embrace the unconventional or less known abilities, found themselves holding the true treasures of the superpower selection. People who had chosen lesser-known powers such as chronokinesis, the manipulation of time, or omni-linguism, the ability to understand and speak every language, basked in the uniqueness and strength of their gifts. They traversed the world, solving complex problems and bringing harmony where chaos had once prevailed. The discontent grew among those who had desired popular abilities like shape-shifting or elemental manipulation, only to find their powers feeble and insignificant.

Confusion washed over me, my mind struggling to comprehend its words. Was this some kind of cruel joke? Shouldn't Death be coming to claim my soul? My heart pounded in my chest as I cautiously asked, \"Then...who are you here for?\" Death's dark, hooded figure seemed to hover just inches away, its skeletal hand extending towards a corner of the room. I followed its gaze and saw a frail old man lying in a bed, struggling for each breath. Tears welled up in my eyes as I realized Death had come for someone I loved. \"Please,\" I pleaded, my voice trembling, \"spare him. Give him more time, more moments of laughter and love.\" Death regarded me with its unyielding gaze, its eyes full of compassion hidden beneath the abyss of eternity. \"Mortal,\" it murmured, \"your plea is heard. Fate has deemed it so.\" A surge of hope ignited within me, pushing me forward to the old man's side. I held his trembling hand, thankful for the chance to be with him a little longer.

Time stretched and molded, granting the old man a reprieve from his imminent demise. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as he experienced moments of joy and rekindled connections with loved ones. Though Death's touch would eventually come, it had shown mercy, granting him a beautiful final chapter. In the twilight of his life, the old man passed away surrounded by loved ones, his face serene and content. And as Death gently claimed his spirit, I understood the profound truth it had shown me - that amidst the inevitability of its existence, there could still be compassion and unexpected grace.",

Determined to find a way back to reality, I noticed a glowing corpse lying in front of me. Curiosity mingled with disgust as I realized the glow emanated from a key clenched in the lifeless hand. I hesitated for a moment before reaching out and taking hold of the key, instantly feeling a strange energy surging through my body. The corpse no longer glowed, and I knew the key held some significance. Using it, I unlocked the door to an eerie corridor, where shadowed figures lurked and mysterious markings adorned the floor.

They roamed the untamed lands, seeking sustenance, unaware of what could nourish their bodies and what could bring them harm. With each rumbling stomach, they faced a choice: to feast or to wither away. They relied on their instincts, relying on trial and error, tasting plants and fruits, and chewing on the flesh of animals. Some bites brought pleasurable flavors, while others caused them to retch in disgust. They learned to discern the edible from the poisonous, the beneficial from the lethal. They watched animals forage and imitated their choices, observing which plants infused them with strength and which brought them close to death's grasp. The first humans gathered around campfires, sharing stories of triumph and near misses, passing on their newfound knowledge to the next generation. They learned to cultivate crops, harnessing the earth's bounty to sustain them through the seasons. Year by year, their understanding of nourishment grew more refined, and they developed a deep respect for the plants and animals that fueled their existence. They became custodians of the earth, seeking harmony with nature rather than mere conquest. As time flowed like a river, the first humans transitioned from being voracious consumers of everything in their path to mindful stewards of the edible world, forever grateful for the wisdom bestowed by the hunger that once consumed them.",

As a writer, I do submit writing prompts from time to time, although not as frequently as I would like. There are a few reasons behind my submission choices. Firstly, when I come across a unique and intriguing prompt idea, I can't resist the urge to share it with the writing community. It's a way for me to contribute and inspire others, just as I've been inspired countless times by the prompts I've encountered.Secondly, submitting prompts gives me an opportunity to challenge myself and explore different writing styles or genres. By creating prompts that are outside my comfort zone, I can push my creative boundaries and enhance my skills as a writer. It's exciting to see how diverse interpretations unfold from a single prompt, with each writer bringing their own perspective and voice to the table.Additionally, submitting prompts opens doors for collaboration and connection with fellow writers. It's fascinating to witness the various responses that emerge and engage in discussions about the different ideas and approaches. The writing community is a supportive and enriching environment, and by sharing prompts, I can contribute to its growth and foster meaningful interactions.Of course, there are times when I hesitate to submit prompts. Doubts may creep in, questioning whether my ideas are compelling enough or if they will resonate with others. However, I've come to realize that creativity is subjective, and what may not appeal to one person can captivate another. So, I've learned to embrace my ideas and submit them regardless, trusting that they have the potential to ignite someone's imagination.In conclusion, I do submit writing prompts because it allows me to inspire others, challenge myself, and connect with fellow writers. It's a fulfilling and rewarding experience that fuels my passion for writing and reminds me of the beauty of storytelling.",

Critics dismissed it as a reckless gamble, while others muttered that humans must have a death wish.Regardless of the opinions of their extraterrestrial peers, humanity pressed forward. They poured their brightest minds into perfecting the UHD technology, undeterred by the skepticism surrounding their choice. Years of research and countless failed experiments marked their relentless pursuit of a successful FTL system.As time went on, the first human spacecraft equipped with the UHD was ready for its maiden voyage. The galactic community held its collective breath, anticipating disaster and tragedy. The humans, however, displayed uncommon resolve and stepped confidently onto the ship.Engines roared to life, and the UHD initiated its highly unorthodox process. The gravitational pull of a nearby black hole was harnessed, bending space and time to create a temporary wormhole. The human vessel shot through the fabric of reality, disappearing from the eyes of the onlookers.Minutes later, the ship reappeared at its destination, unscathed and victorious. The crew, in awe of their own accomplishment, transmitted their success back to Earth and the rest of the galaxy. The extraterrestrial onlookers were left stunned and speechless.",

At the age of seventy-five, with the specter of mortality looming, something in Walter stirred, and he decided it was time to set things right. He embarked on a mission, fueled by determination and the desire for redemption. His first stop was a small town where he had once betrayed a dear friend. Walter sought out the local library and spent hours poring over old records, searching for any trace of his friend's descendants. Finally, he found a name - Emily Thompson - his friend's granddaughter. Armed with this information, he tracked down Emily's address and knocked on her door.

He recounted the story of his betrayal and expressed his sincere remorse. Emily listened, her face softening with each word. With a trembling voice, she forgave him, and the burden that had haunted Walter for decades started to lift. Encouraged by this small victory, Walter embarked on a series of journeys, seeking out those he had wronged. He traveled across the country, tirelessly searching, reaching out, and making amends. Along the way, he encountered skepticism, anger, and even rejection, but he pressed on, undeterred. With every apology, he felt a piece of his soul heal, and he saw glimpses of forgiveness and reconciliation.

It is now 2060, and I find myself among the chosen, the ones selected to be sacrificed yet again. But this time, I refuse to go quietly into the night. As I stand before the towering alien overlords, their eyes pulsating with an eerie luminescence, a fire ignites within me. I refuse to bow down, to accept this fate of perpetual subjugation. With trembling resolve, I boldly raise my voice and speak my truth. \"We are not your playthings. We are survivors, fighters, and we will not surrender our freedom.\"The aliens' collective gaze shifts towards me, their expressions a blend of curiosity and disdain. They did not expect defiance from their chosen victims. Ignoring their silent intimidation tactics, I continue to challenge their authority. \"We have endured unimaginable loss, but we have also discovered our resilience. We will not continue this cycle of sacrifice. We will find a way to fight back.\"An uneasy murmuring spreads amongst the alien ranks, their delicate balance of power momentarily disrupted by my words.

The trial began, presenting evidence against a man named Michael Hayes, accused of the very crimes that Adrian had committed. As the evidence unfolded, Adrian's mind swirled with a mix of guilt and amusement. He knew every detail, every gory scene, because he was the one responsible. The prosecution called their witnesses, each testifying with conviction, unaware of the true monster among them. Adrian played his role flawlessly, asking carefully crafted questions that revealed inconsistencies in the testimony.

The very nature of the pen made it susceptible to its own erasure. Its ink could not only eliminate words but also its existence. Panic set in as I frantically searched every nook and cranny of the drawer, my hands trembling with a mixture of fear and regret.[user]: I couldn't believe what I had done.[assistant]: With each passing second, the weight of my actions bore down on me.",

Together, we formed a formidable alliance to participate in this historic auction.Through meticulous planning and strategic negotiations, we managed to secure the rights to several key interstate highways. Our ambition? To transform these once-congested thoroughfares into vibrant green corridors.Over the years that followed, we worked tirelessly to breathe life into our vision. We repurposed the asphalt into eco-friendly materials, creating lush parks, serene walking trails, and flourishing gardens.These former highways became sanctuaries for both humans and wildlife. Families strolled amidst blooming flowers, children laughed as they explored hidden groves, and birds sang melodies from the treetops.In one stretch of highway, we installed cutting-edge solar panels, harnessing the sun's energy to power nearby communities. Electric shuttles glided along sleek tracks, offering a sustainable mode of transportation.Another highway was transformed into an innovative agriculture hub. Vertical farms sprouted alongside aquaponics systems, providing fresh, locally grown produce to the surrounding cities.We envisioned these green corridors not only as recreational spaces but also as educational centers. Interactive exhibits taught visitors about sustainability, biodiversity, and the importance of preserving our planet.The once-polluted air transformed into a pristine haven, with reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality. The transformation was a testament to the power of collaboration and the boundless potential of human ingenuity.",

As he struggled to gather his bearings, Adam noticed he was dressed in a plain white robe, his movements restricted by an unseen force. Panic surged within him, but he could find no escape.Exploring the room, Adam discovered it was devoid of windows or any indication of the outside world.

These markings seemed to hold a deeper meaning, a code he was determined to decipher.As time passed, Adam became convinced that the symbols held the key to his freedom. With unwavering resolve, he immersed himself in their study, poring over every detail. Slowly, he began to piece together their significance, discovering a hidden message concealed within the patterns.The revelation struck him like a lightning bolt.

You dare trifle with the Dark Lord of Mordor? \"The engraver prostrated himself, his voice quivering. \" Mercy, my lord!

He could not discard it, but neither could he risk wielding it with such a ridiculous inscription.An idea sparked in his malicious mind. With a wave of his hand, Sauron summoned his servants. \" Gather all the gold and jewels from my treasury, \" he commanded. \" We shall create a new ring, one worthy of my dominion. \"The servants scurried to obey, knowing full well the consequences of displeasing their master. As they labored, Sauron pondered the inscription for the new ring.

The words resonated with dark majesty, promising dominion over all of Middle-earth.With the inscription complete, Sauron channeled his malevolent energy into the molten gold and jewels. The ring took shape, its surface shimmering with an evil light. As he slipped it onto his finger, Sauron felt a surge of dark power course through his veins.A triumphant smile spread across his face. The flawed ring had been a setback, but now he possessed an instrument of dominion that would make all of Middle-earth tremble at his feet.",

Achilles walked slowly through the crowded city sidewalks, having lived for millennia but never aging from the day he was dipped in the river Styx. 2. As he scanned the faces of the passersby, one caught his eye - an unusually pale man who seemed out of place in the modern crowd.3. Their eyes met briefly, and in that moment each knew that the other was not what they appeared to be. 4. Achilles remembered the last battle he fought, centuries ago, when his heel was pierced by an arrow and he realized with horror that he would live forever.5. This man, who introduced himself as Caleb, told of being cursed three thousand years ago by an ancient witch for refusing her advances. 6. Never to die, but never to age, Caleb had wandered the earth alone since, believing Achilles was just a character from myths long forgotten.7. Over coffee in a quiet cafe, they spoke for hours of all they had witnessed - empires rising and falling, wars, inventions, and the evolving world.8. Though neither wished for eternal life, both took comfort that they were not the only ones forced to wander endlessly amid changing mortal lives.9. As evening fell and the cafe emptied, Achilles contemplated the curse of never finding peace in death, of watching all he knew turn to dust while he remained. 10. Caleb invited Achilles to join him on his travels, to stave off the solitude together, an invitation Achilles readily accepted though he missed his mortal friends.11. And so the immortal duo set off to see what new wonders the future might hold, taking small joy in each other's company on the roads ahead.  12. Years passed as cities changed around them, yet Achilles and Caleb remained unchanged, wandering between centuries.13. Together they provided perspective for leaders making decisions that would shape nations for generations, though their counsel was not always heeded. 14.",

It had been a hot day on the farm and she was looking forward to relaxing. At the end of the road was her favorite spot, a cluster of oak trees that overlooked the valley. She parked and grabbed two beers from the cooler in the bed of the truck. Leaning against the tire, she popped one open and took a long drink, gazing out at the setting sun.

Emma said yes, watching him drive away with a smile, thinking it had been a perfect night under the old oak trees.",

Video footage showed structures on the seafloor that could not be natural. Scientists were called in to investigate further. What they found defied explanation: an entire civilization, with cities and advanced technology, had existed under the waves for who knows how long. Initial contact was cautious, with both sides wary. Communication was established through complex light signals that conveyed ideas with surprising nuance. Learning each other's languages took many exchanges over months.These beings, who called themselves the Sui, were similar to humans in many ways. They lived in families and had a society with different roles. But they also had abilities like bioluminescence and the power to withstand immense pressures. Trade and cultural sharing began in earnest. The Sui shared their marine botanical discoveries that could aid medicine and energy production on land. In turn, humans allowed visits to the surface in protective suits to experience air and sunlight. Political tensions soon emerged between nations possessive of this new frontier. Some wanted domination over access to the Sui and their resources, while others pushed for open cooperation. This threatened the tentative peace built between the two civilizations.The Sui now found themselves caught in conflicts not of their making. They grew weary of dealings with the surface that brought rising discord instead of partnership. Withdrawing deeper, they considered limiting contact to avoid being pulled into human disputes. Leaders on both sides realized the delicate balance was at a tipping point. To safeguard the relationship and continue learning from one another, new protections and oversight had to be put in place above and below the waves. The alternative was a possible return to isolation that benefits neither humans nor Sui in the end.",

The Castle in the Clouds, as it was known, was a marvel of architecture and magic, its towers and spires stretching towards the heavens like a shimmering, ethereal dream. The castle was said to be the seat of the kingdom's ruler, the enigmatic Queen Artemis, who was rumored to possess the power to control the very fabric of reality. Few had ever seen the queen, and even fewer had been granted an audience with her. The castle's isolation only added to its mystique, and many believed that it was a place of ancient and powerful magic.

I wrote about the times I had failed, the times I had hurt others, the times I had felt lost and alone.I wrote about the moments that had defined me, the moments that had broken me, the moments that had made me whole again.And as I wrote, I felt a weight lifting off my shoulders. I felt free. Free to be myself, free to tell my story, free to be honest.I wrote until the words wouldn't come anymore, until my heart was empty and my soul was full. And when I finally put down my pen, I knew that I had created something truly special.I had created a story that was mine, a story that was true, a story that would live on long after I was gone.And as I sat back and read through the pages, I knew that I had done something truly amazing. I had written my autobiography, and it was beautiful.",

He was mortal, a relic of a time long past when death was a natural part of life. As he lay on his deathbed, surrounded by the images of his immortal loved ones, he couldn't help but feel a sense of regret. He had lived a full life, but it was nothing compared to the endless years that stretched out before those who had discovered the secret to immortality. He thought back to the day he had chosen not to take the selfie that would have granted him eternal life, and he wondered if it had been a mistake. But as he looked into the eyes of his family, he knew that he had lived a life worth living, and that he had no regrets. With a final sigh, he closed his eyes and passed into the great beyond, leaving behind a world that would continue on without him.",

The country had never had an openly gay president, but that was about to change. The Democratic Party had nominated a charismatic and accomplished candidate named Sarah Jones, who had been a champion for LGBTQ+ rights throughout her political career. Despite some initial hesitation from some voters, Jones had won the election in a landslide, carrying all 50 states and earning the support of a diverse coalition of Americans. On Inauguration Day, Jones stood on the steps of the Capitol, surrounded by her loving partner and their two children, as she took the oath of office. As she raised her right hand, a sense of pride and hope washed over the crowd, and Jones became the first openly gay president in U.S. history. Despite the usual challenges that come with the job, Jones proved to be a popular and effective leader, with a keen ability to listen to opposing viewpoints and find common ground. She fought for policies that benefited all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Four years later, Jones was re-elected in another landslide, and her approval ratings continued to soar. Her presidency marked a new era of inclusivity and acceptance in American politics, paving the way for future generations of LGBTQ+ leaders.",

They knew that Alex would do everything in his power to escape and wreak havoc on society once again.As they transported the baby to a secure facility, they couldn't help but wonder what kind of person he would grow up to be. Would he still have the same twisted desires and urges as his previous incarnation?Only time would tell, but for now, Interpol had done its job. They had contained a dangerous criminal and prevented him from causing any more harm.",

It was a card game that had gained popularity among the students, but the teachers were concerned that it was distracting them from their studies and encouraging a negative obsession with magic. Professor McGonagall had caught students sneaking in cards during classes, and even Professor Snape had noticed that his potions students were more interested in brewing potions to help them win the game than in mastering the art of potion-making. The game had become a sensation, with students trading cards and gathering in secret to play. The teachers were worried that it was fostering a culture of competition and obsession that was detrimental to the students' well-being and academic performance. They decided to hold a meeting to discuss the issue and come up with a plan to address it.",

I've been wanting to write this letter for a long time, but I couldn't bring myself to do it until now.I'm still trying to process everything that happened between us. It's been [insert time frame] since we broke up, and I'm still struggling to move on.I know I'm not supposed to be in contact with you, but I couldn't help myself. I miss you so much, and my heart aches every day without you by my side.I know we had our differences and that we ultimately grew apart, but that doesn't change the fact that I love you.I remember the first time we met like it was yesterday. You walked into the room with your head held high and a smile on your face. I knew right then and there that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.Over time, things changed. We started to argue more, and the fights became more frequent. I know I wasn't perfect, and My apologies for my part in our downfall.Despite all of that, I can't help but wonder what could've been if we had tried harder to work things out.I know it's pointless to think about now, but I can't help it. I miss the way you made me laugh, the way you always knew how to make me feel better when I was down.I miss our late-night conversations and our silly jokes. I miss the way we used to cuddle on the couch and watch movies together.Most of all, I miss you. I miss the way you always challenged me to be my best self and pushed me to pursue my dreams.I know we're not meant to be together, but a part of me will always love you.I hope one day we can be friends again. Maybe then I'll be able to move on and find someone who loves me for who I am, flaws and all.Until then, I'll hold onto the memories of our time together and hope that someday I'll find my way back to you.Yours always,[Your Name]",

And in return, I would grant them the power of comedy.But as time went on, my power grew. I became more than just a god of comedy. I became a god of chaos. I would cause mischief and mayhem wherever I went. A lost screw here, a misplaced button there. And people began to fear me.They would try to appease me with more and more offerings, but it was never enough. I wanted more. I craved more. And so, I began to expand my domain.I started small, just a few kitchen utensils here and there. But soon, I was ruling over an empire of plasticware. And still, people feared me. They would whisper stories of my power, of my wrath.But I was not content to simply rule over plasticware. I wanted more. I wanted the world. And so, I began to spread my influence. I started with the kitchen, moving into the living room, the bedroom. And soon, I was everywhere.People would wake up in the morning and find that their toasters had been replaced with rubber chickens. They would go to bed at night and find that their pillows had been filled with silly putty. And I was always there, watching, waiting.I became known as the god of mischief, the lord of chaos. And people would tremble at the mention of my name. But I was not content to simply be feared. I wanted to be loved.

It was old, rusted, and covered in strange symbols. We hailed the ship, but there was no response.We decided to board the ship, hoping to find some answers. The interior was dark, dank, and smelled of decay. We found evidence of a long-abandoned civilization, but nothing that could explain the purpose of the ship. Frustrated, we decided to return to our own ship and continue our mission.But as we were leaving, we heard a strange noise. It sounded like a voice, echoing through the vast emptiness of space.

That's when I knew she was the one, the one who would understand, who would care for it like it was her own.I offered to sell it to her, but she hesitated. She said she didn't have much money, and I could see the disappointment in her eyes. That's when I decided to give it to her, to make her happy. It was a small thing, but it was worth it to see her smile.As she left the shop, bear in hand, I couldn't help but feel a sense of joy. It was a small act of kindness, but it made my day a little brighter. And who knows, maybe one day she'll come back and visit, and I'll get to see how the bear has brought her happiness. That's nice, dear.",

As he made his way through the rows of bodies, he noticed one that looked familiar. It was a tall, lanky man with a mop of messy brown hair. Suddenly, the man realized that the body was his own. He stared at it in shock, unable to believe what he was seeing. How could this be? He was clearly alive, standing here in front of his own corpse. The man's mind raced with questions. Was this some kind of bizarre joke? Had he somehow been transported to a parallel universe where he had already died? He reached out to touch his own hand, feeling the cold, stiff flesh. It was a strange sensation, as if he was both alive and dead at the same time. The man's gaze drifted up to his own face, which was pale and drawn. He looked like he had been dead for days. Suddenly, the man's eyes flickered open. He was alive, and he was staring at his own corpse. Panic set in as he realized that he had no idea how this had happened. He tried to speak, but his voice was barely a whisper. The man's heart raced as he tried to make sense of this bizarre turn of events. He looked down at his own hands, which were shaking uncontrollably. He tried to take a step back, but his legs wouldn't move. He was frozen in place, staring at his own dead body. The man's mind was racing with thoughts of how this could be. Was he in some kind of afterlife? Had he actually died and didn't even realize it? The questions kept coming, but there were no answers. The man's eyes darted around the morgue, hoping to find some kind of explanation. He saw other bodies, all of them still and lifeless. How was it that he was able to move and speak, while they were not? The man's thoughts turned to his loved ones, and he wondered if they knew that he was gone.",

The plan was to storm the beaches of Normandy and push the Germans back, but things didn't go as expected.The invasion was a disaster from the start. The Germans were better prepared than anticipated, and the Allied forces suffered heavy casualties.As the day wore on, it became clear that the invasion was a failure. The Allied forces were pinned down on the beaches, and morale was low.One soldier, Private Johnson, had an idea. It was a risky plan, but he was desperate to turn the tide of the war.He gathered a small group of soldiers and proposed his plan. \"We need to create a diversion,\" he said. \"Something big, something that will catch the Germans off guard.\"The plan was simple: they would dress up as Germans and infiltrate the enemy lines. Once inside, they would cause chaos and confusion, giving the Allied forces a chance to regroup and launch a counterattack.The soldiers looked at each other nervously. It was a crazy plan, but they were willing to try anything.They quickly gathered supplies and set off towards the German lines. They moved quietly, avoiding detection as they made their way deeper into enemy territory.As they approached the German camp, they could hear the sound of soldiers laughing and drinking. It was the perfect opportunity.Private Johnson gave the signal, and the soldiers burst into the camp, guns blazing. They fired randomly, hoping to create as much confusion as possible.The Germans were caught off guard, and they didn't know what hit them. They returned fire, but the Allied soldiers were well-trained and managed to avoid most of the bullets.The diversion was working. The Germans were scrambling to respond, and the Allied forces were taking advantage of the confusion.As the battle raged on, Private Johnson and his team made their way deeper into the camp, causing destruction wherever they went.",

It's like there's someone else in there, talking to me, guiding me.Sometimes, the voice is nice and helpful, telling me to do things that are good for me. But other times, it's mean and critical, pointing out all my flaws and telling me I'm not good enough.I'm not sure how to explain it to people, but it's like there's a constant conversation going on in my head. It's exhausting, to be honest.I've tried to ignore the voice, but it never goes away. It's always there, whispering in my ear, telling me what to do.I've even tried to argue with it, but that never works. The voice is always right, it seems, and I'm always left feeling foolish.I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or if this is just some kind of inner dialogue that everyone has.But sometimes, I swear, the voice is mad at me. It gets angry when I don't listen to it, when I do something it doesn't want me to do.I've tried to tell myself that it's just my imagination, that the voice is just a manifestation of my own insecurities.But what if it's not? What if there's really someone or something in my head, controlling my every move?I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind.I just want the voice to go away and leave me alone. But it never does. It's always there, lurking in the background, waiting to pounce.I'm not sure how much longer I can take this. It's like living with a constant critique, always feeling like I'm not good enough.I wish I could turn off the voice, turn it off and never hear it again. But I know that's not possible. It's a part of me, for better or for worse.So, I'll just have to learn to live with it, I guess. Try to ignore it when it's mean and focus on the positive things it says.

With all ailments cured, the population had grown exponentially, leading to overcrowding and devastating consequences for the planet. A top-secret board of 9 individuals, including myself, had been formed to address this issue. Our task was to decide whether to release a newly developed pathogen that would wipe out 3/4 of the population, allowing humanity to start anew.As the final vote approached, tensions were running high. Eight members of the board had already cast their votes, and the decision now rested in my hands. I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders, knowing that my choice would determine the fate of billions of people.I took a deep breath and reviewed the arguments presented by my colleagues. Some had advocated for the release of the pathogen, citing the need to restore balance to the Earth's ecosystems and prevent further suffering. Others had opposed it, warning of the unforeseeable consequences and the potential for catastrophic failure.I knew that this was a decision that would go down in history, and I was filled with a sense of dread. I did not want to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people, no matter what the greater good might be. And yet, I also knew that inaction would only lead to further suffering and eventual collapse.I closed my eyes and tried to clear my mind. I thought about the people I loved, and the people I didn't know. I thought about the children who would never be born, and the families who would be torn apart. And I thought about the future, and what kind of world we wanted to create.After what felt like an eternity, I made my decision. I stood up, took a deep breath, and spoke. \"I vote yes,\" I said, my voice trembling. \"We must release the pathogen, and give humanity a chance to start again.\"The room fell silent, and I could feel the weight of my colleagues' gazes upon me.",

But as they continued to take on new cases, they found themselves facing increasingly dangerous opponents. Gone were the days of catching crooks who were only out to steal money or artifacts. Now, they were dealing with real, dangerous murderers and rapists. It was a tall order for a group of teenagers and their talking dog, but they were determined to see justice served. Their first case was a particularly brutal murder. A young woman had been found dead in her apartment, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The police were stumped, and the gang knew they had to act fast. They began by interviewing the victim's friends and family, but no one seemed to have any information that could help them. It wasn't until they stumbled upon a strange symbol etched into the wall near the victim's body that they finally had a lead. They traced the symbol to a local gang, known for their violent tactics and connections to organized crime. The gang knew they had to tread carefully, but they couldn't let the fear of danger stop them. They decided to go undercover and infiltrate the gang, with Shaggy and Scooby posing as new recruits. It wasn't easy, but they managed to gain the trust of the gang's leader, a ruthless man named Vinnie. Meanwhile, Velma and Daphne worked to gather evidence from the crime scene, piecing together the events of the night of the murder. They discovered that the victim had been involved in a heated argument with Vinnie just hours before her death. It was clear that he had a motive, but they still needed to find the weapon and catch him in the act. Shaggy and Scooby managed to get close to Vinnie, earning his trust and even gaining access to his private quarters. They found the murder weapon, a knife with a distinctive handle, and knew they had to act fast.",

We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied.

Then I contacted them multiple times trying to reasses my monthly payment, as I couldn't keep up with all of my bills, I spoke with Mary in the finance department and through our conversation she was rude and extremely hostile. She accused me of lying when I told her I had been calling in and trying to find a solution, when I asked her if I still paid my payments but paid less, she said that they would send me to collections for not making the full amount. Then she looked in my account and saw that I had money in there (enough for only 2 months of rent and my bills.. . will no real income coming in) and said that there was obviously no reason I was having problems and I shouldn't have even called her. I was really frustrated, I was trying to negotiate so I didn't have to file bankruptcy. Then after I could no longer pay, due to my dire financial situation, they took out all the money I had in my account and applied it towards the loan.. . i.e. my rent, without any phone calls or letters reaching out to me before they were going to take my money.

A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention. nnWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients. nnIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business. If they don't want our business, we won't give it to them any more.",

We really just had one who had to be cut by someone else. nnHe was so big, and his hair would get so matted that it was virtually impossible for us to do it. So we needed help. That's when we called on A Dog's Best Friend. We did take another of our dogs there a couple of times, but she was smaller, and so we'd typically do her hair ourselves. nnThe others either didn't need cutting - ever - or are so small that it's just not worth it. But for the larger dogs that take too long or are too difficult for us to control? It's absolutely worth having someone else do. That's when you need a professional, and they take care of them. nnOn the down side of things, they are a bit pricey. For a bath and a cut (or a cut and a bath, I have no idea which order they do it), it would be $70, and that was some time ago. It's nice to not have to do it, but we couldn't afford to do it very often. Great job, he looked great, but man that was expensive!",

Put in our orders for two burgers (his with fries, mine fruit--I do like the option of getting fruit with my burger) within minutes of sitting down. However, it took 20 minutes to get our food. The place was NOT busy. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar, where we were seated. nnAbout 5 minutes after getting our food, my fiance let them know that he would like more fries. We finished eating, and waited for the fries. And waited for fries. And waited for fries. 20 minutes we sat there and waited. They continually told us \"They'll be up soon\" and \"Your fries are on the way\". I did make a point to communicate with the waitress that I needed to get back to work, and continually asked how much longer it would be, and eventually asked if we could get them in a to-go box because I was already late to work. However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs. This is for LUNCH TIME. Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer. nnIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries. I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting. I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. nnPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited. Ridiculous. Left the bar paying $7 for a small cheeseburger and still feeling incredibly hungry, ripped off and PISSED.",

Our Drinks came and they were not made correctly but the waitress cheerfully took them back to the bar and brought out another version, still not right -- and irritating when we got the check and it was 8. 20 for the drink and 2. 50 for the bar brand liquor in it. That means we paid 8. 20 for club soda and a cherry.. hmmmmnI ordered the Spaghetti all Gricia.. it was thin spaghetti and caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon, and pecorino cheese. Very interesting.. not Italian but really good. . but I would rename it Bacon Lo Mein.. . My Husband ordered the Lasagna, he said it was good but the meat was stringy?? Our friends had the Pollo Romano, which was basically a Chicken Parm, it was a great size portion, and seemed like our friend enjoyed it. Her partner had the Cotoletta ala bolognese, it was a fried chicken cutlet topped with Parmesan cheese and proscuitto, It was also a nice size portion but it was swimming in grease, like the cheese had melted and they used to much oil to fry it.. they did replate it for my friend but she could still not eat it and they very nicely took it off the bill. nThe desert.. .. was the VERY best thing on the menu--NUTELLA PIE.. It was a combo of Nutella, peanut butter, marscapone cheese with a graham cracker crust.. . heavenly, I would have eaten more but I had filled up on the bread! nAll in all.. its a okay dinner place.. . not authentic Italian at all.. Large family style portions, but not my AMORE.. . Loved our company.. not so much the meal.. Sorry Mama.. ..",

They most definitely have the same feel - messy food paintings full of edgy, contrasty colors, that damn jewel tone color scheme that immediately calls to mind fancy Mall, opulent textures bandied about, willy-nilly. I've given Mama's three chances to transcend the bad decor choices with delicious foods, and she's failed me, every time. nnDinners - universally too salty, and if salts-everything-before-tasting-it me is saying that, well. This preserved, pickled thing is inescapable - if it isn't a preserved roasted pepper overwhelming your salad, it's a pickled artichoke or so many Kalamatas (yay Greece) smothering your pizza that any chance of digging on the housemade mozz is gone. Even Bruschetta tastes like it's been doused with anti-aging liquids and sat at the bottom of a very deep fridge for who knows how long. nnIn true Olive Garden style, salads are overdressed before making it to your table, so it's all a wilty, mixed up mess. That ain't how they do it in Italia, kids! That's how they do it in Bottomless Breadstickville. nnService is probably where they've spent the most energy and it shows - people are quick, smiley, knowledgeable. But try three was brunch this weekend, and the Benedict was so Stouffer's (accompanied by the blandest breakfast taters I've ever not eaten, and seriously, what cheese was that under my two asparagus spears, Muenster? Srsly?! ) that, like I said, I give up. Che cosa una delusione.",

The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast. nnHere's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour. So preoccupied with his little computer screen he was that he didn't even look at me and waved me off with a we don't validate parking here, pay the machine on your way out. Seriously? I know I look a bit young and my clothes were kinda grungy when I left but the housekeeping when I first got here was nicer to me than you were.

The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. nnThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. nnAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better.

If I dont eat everything, Its not that the food inst good its just i will finish eating and stop eating. If my friend and I haven't eaten anything in 5 mins it means WERE DONE. thanksnnThe food was fine. Its nothing I haven't seen anywhere else. For an appetizer we had the pan-fried calamari. It was okay, the wrapped lemon was a cute touch but i mean honesty the calamari was too battered and not crisp enough. For an entree I had the Sushi grade tuna. It was cooked perfectly. THe sauces were fun but not one that i completely loved. I had a side of assperagus and it was amazing. I always seem to get the overcooked asperagus but this time they were perfect and served with hollandaise. nnI dont think for the price I would come back.

The place is huge and daunting, but relatively well laid out, and it features a ton of stores for your perusal. It's reasonably clean and nice, so it has that going for it. There are decent - but not great - attempts made to offer plugs and internet connectivity, though a lot more work remains. nnProblem with this place is simple: it's way too crowded and it doesn't know how to handle it. TSA inspection lines are often dauntingly long, halls are often jam-packed, and people are often stopped in the middle of the hall for want of a place to sit or relax. Lines for food become cumbersome and scary to the point where I've foregone breakfast just to avoid the wait. This could likely be fixed by expansion, but I doubt that will happen any time soon. nnAll in all, this is not as bad as LaGuardia, but it's not nearly as good as its competitors.",

The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!! ! Horrible!! ! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food.

Overall they felt flat and had an overwhelming garlic taste that became too much after one or two (and I love garlic -fyi)  I don't think I could eat them again. The Mac n Cheese as my side was a saving grace. Wow-awesome! Cheesy-stringy deliciousness and I ate it right up. My other side was the mashed potatoes which tasted great at first bite but again became overwhelming fast. Perhaps if I went with a veggie side I would have felt better but the food was so rich I felt queasy by the end. My boyfriend ate my cornbread as I don't care for that myself, and he liked it quite a bit. nnI had a bite of my boyfriends steak and eggs which were way overcooked and the steak was literally coated with grease - definitely not my type of thing. He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well. nnI thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath.

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom. nnStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out. nnBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9. 95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel. nnMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer.

After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs. By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well. I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate. I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did. After wards i made a quick exit. nnThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here. I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least. Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment. A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation. It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me. On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well.

Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. nnThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge.

From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount. nnSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers. nnWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \"Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check! ). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. nnSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help. nnAnd what's a cake without icing?

Our friends and family got some of the second dozen, but we housed the first and a few of the second. nnNext to the burnt almond cup (I've only had the cups) my favorites were the red velvet (take that all you stupid cupcake trucks), the german chocolate and the white chocolate rasperry. But they were all good.. . I couldn't say any were something I wouldn't steal from a small child. I love how all the cups these are like sushi in their delivery. you get a bit of everything in each small bite. nnOne thing to be aware of.. . some of their cups are *very* sweet so if you're not a fan of sugar I might suggest the tiramisu or german choclate.. . they are a little less sugary than the rest.",

I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. nnThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here.

I once told him I needed to bring a cheese plate to a party and asked him to pick out the cheese for me, and it was like he had been waiting all his life for someone to ask him for help. He did put together the most awesome cheese tray ever, and I learned all sorts of facts about Humboldt Fog. Now every time I  walk past he comes out behind the counter and gives me a hug, and at Christmas he gave me a little tiny cheese cutter and then everyone aroudn me was like, \"Wow, how much cheese does that woman buy? \" But seriously, talk to the cheese guy, he is awesome! nnTip:  bring the veggie tray. Dont bring the cheese  tray. The cheese tray is $$$ and people only eat the gouda and the cheddar. nnThey sell beer there now, which is good. You'll need some after shopping. The flower selection is also pretty good. nnThere's an Aldi up the street and a Trader Joe's nearby. Both are far less infuriating to shop at.",

Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish. Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives. nnThis place does it all. J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed. I started with some hot sake and a green salad. Their ginger dressing is delish! I was practically licking the bowl. I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came. J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!! ! ! nnI told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it. nnThis brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic. nnI wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area.",

They do have a very basic menu which doesn't change, but the items on there are those that you can pretty easily make at home. The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread. nnI previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice. Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken. The first time I went I got a \"ropa vieja\", which was a very simple meat-only sandwich. The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious. However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat. Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression. nnOverall, be wary of what peruvian food specializes in, and order accordingly. Service is very friendly, and food comes out in 5 minutes because everything is bascially premade at the beginning of the day.",

It's like a ritual for me, an annual pilgrimage to satisfy my cravings. As soon as I take that first bite, all thoughts of calorie counting and nutrition go out the window. The combination of tender meat, crispy fries, and tangy coleslaw piled high between two slices of thick bread is simply irresistible. It may not be gourmet or sophisticated, but it has its own charm and nostalgia that keeps me coming back. The atmosphere of the restaurant adds to the experience, with its bustling, no-frills vibe that feels authentically Pittsburgh. Sure, the place might not be the cleanest, but that's part of its character. It's a no-nonsense joint where you can focus solely on savoring your sandwich.

It would be beneficial if they mentioned this policy explicitly when purchasing tickets, as it can catch some patrons off guard.The audience participation aspect of the show was a highlight for me.

It took ages for someone to even acknowledge our presence and take our drink order. Once our order was finally taken, we had to wait an eternity for our food to arrive. And when it did, it was a letdown. The burger I ordered was overcooked and dry, lacking any flavor. The fries were soggy and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. Even the salad, which should be a safe bet, was wilted and tasteless. It seemed like the kitchen was in disarray, unable to handle the volume of customers. Adding to the frustration, our server was inattentive and seemed more interested in chatting with coworkers than taking care of our needs. We had to ask multiple times for refills on our drinks, and it felt like a burden to even request basic condiments. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was lackluster and uninviting, with worn-out furnishings and a general sense of neglect. It is disappointing because I have had decent experiences at Eat n Park in the past, but this visit left a sour taste in my mouth. I genuinely hope that they can address these issues and improve the quality of both their food and service. As it stands, I cannot recommend this particular location based on my recent encounter.

They're worn out and don't provide the true feel of a good shot. It becomes frustrating when you're trying to gauge your distance and accuracy, but the equipment hinders your progress. Additionally, the mats themselves are in a sorry state. They're old, worn, and uneven, making it difficult to get into a proper hitting rhythm. It's disappointing to see such neglect in a facility that could be so profitable. The practice putting green is another sore point. Every putt you attempt becomes an unpredictable adventure due to the excessive break on the green. It's virtually impossible to practice your level putts and gain any consistency. Moreover, the condition of the grass on the putting green is subpar at best. The uneven surface and patches of unhealthy grass make it difficult to get a true roll and feels like a missed opportunity to improve your short game. As for the practice chipping green, it poses its own set of challenges. The incline is far too steep, causing well-struck shots to roll off the edge and down the hill, often reaching the fence by the driving range. It's frustrating to have your practice shots punished rather than rewarded. While the location of the driving range is convenient for tourists and beginners, serious golfers seeking a place to sharpen their skills will be left disappointed. It lacks the necessary facilities and attention to detail required for rigorous practice.

The service was efficient without feeling rushed, allowing us to savor our meal and enjoy each other's company. We couldn't resist trying some desserts, and we were not disappointed. The green tea ice cream and mochi were the perfect sweet endings to our satisfying lunch. Overall, our experience at Sushi Kim exceeded our expectations. The food, service, and atmosphere came together to create a memorable dining experience. We will definitely be returning to Sushi Kim for more sushi delights in the future.",

The layout of the store is well-organized, with different sections for clothing, furniture, toys, and household items. It makes navigating through the aisles a breeze. The pricing here is generally fair, and I've found some incredible bargains over the years. From vintage dresses to unique collectibles, there's always something intriguing waiting to be discovered.What sets this thrift store apart is the ever-changing inventory. They regularly introduce new items, ensuring that each visit brings a fresh experience. I've even witnessed them restocking while I was browsing, which is a testament to their dedication to providing a diverse selection. However, it's important to keep in mind that not every visit guarantees success. Thrift shopping is all about luck, and sometimes you'll come across items that don't meet your expectations.One aspect I particularly appreciate is their commitment to sustainability. Thrifting is not only a great way to save money but also an eco-friendly choice. By giving pre-loved items a second chance, we reduce waste and contribute to a more sustainable future. This store definitely embraces that philosophy. It's heartwarming to see how they promote recycling and encourage others to embrace a thrifted lifestyle.The staff members are generally friendly and approachable. They create a welcoming atmosphere, making you feel comfortable as you explore the store. On occasions when I needed assistance, they were ready to help without being intrusive. That balance is important to me; I like having space to browse while knowing that support is readily available when needed.Parking is usually convenient, and I've never encountered any issues finding a spot. The store's cleanliness is also commendable. I've been to some thrift shops that felt dusty and neglected, but this one maintains a neat and tidy environment.",

The park itself seemed to be in need of some maintenance and repairs. The attractions were somewhat outdated, and some of them didn't seem to be working properly. It was a bit disappointing, as I had higher expectations based on the advertisements and previous reviews I had read.The lines for the slides and rides were quite long, especially during peak hours. We had to wait for what felt like an eternity just to get on a few slides. I understand that water parks can get crowded, but it seemed like there weren't enough staff members to efficiently manage the queues and keep things moving.On a positive note, I did appreciate the variety of slides and attractions available. There were options for both thrill-seekers and those who prefer more relaxed experiences. My kids particularly enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river. However, I found some of the slides to be underwhelming and lacking in excitement. They could definitely use some updating and refurbishment.The food options at the park were limited and overpriced. We ended up bringing our own snacks and drinks because we didn't want to spend a fortune on mediocre food. It would have been nice to see a better selection of affordable and tasty food choices within the park.Another aspect that bothered me was the cleanliness of the park. There were empty food wrappers and cups scattered in some areas, and the restrooms weren't as clean as I would have liked. With so many people visiting the park, it's crucial to have a diligent cleaning crew to maintain a pleasant environment for everyone.The staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful, which was a plus. They seemed genuinely interested in ensuring that visitors had a good experience. However, with the park being understaffed, it was hard for them to address all the concerns and maintain a high level of customer service.",

However, this particular location lacks the friendly and helpful staff that I've encountered at other Home Depots. It's frustrating when you're trying to find something specific and no one is available to assist you. On multiple occasions, I wandered aimlessly through the store, searching for an employee to point me in the right direction. I even tried approaching a few individuals who were wearing the signature orange aprons, but they either looked busy or simply brushed me off. It's disappointing to see such a lack of customer service in a store of this caliber. Even when I managed to find an associate, their knowledge about the products was limited. They couldn't provide detailed information or answer specific questions about certain items. It made me question the training and expertise of the staff at this location. Another aspect that bothered me was the overall cleanliness. The aisles seemed cluttered, and products were often misplaced or haphazardly arranged. It gave the impression of a disorganized and neglected store. Additionally, the checkout process was slow and inefficient. There weren't enough registers open, resulting in long lines and frustrated customers. It's a shame because Home Depot is known for its wide selection and competitive prices. However, based on my experiences at this location, I can't say that I would recommend it. If you have other options nearby, I would suggest exploring them instead. It's essential to have a positive shopping experience, especially when you're undertaking home improvement projects. Sadly, this particular Home Depot falls short in delivering the level of service and quality that customers deserve. I hope they can address these issues and improve the overall experience for future patrons.",

The front desk staff seemed disinterested and unwelcoming, giving me the impression that I was an inconvenience to them.Upon entering my room, I was greeted by a strong musty odor and outdated furnishings. It was evident that the room had not been properly cleaned or maintained. The bedsheets had visible stains, the bathroom had a leaky faucet, and the carpet had an unmistakable layer of dust. I immediately went down to the front desk to request a room change, only to be met with indifference and told that they were fully booked.Throughout my stay, the issues continued to pile up. The Wi-Fi was virtually non-existent in my room, despite the hotel's claims of high-speed internet access. The noise from the neighboring rooms was unbearable, making it nearly impossible to get a good night's sleep. The hotel staff seemed indifferent to any complaints or requests for assistance, further adding to my frustration.To make matters worse, the hotel's amenities were far from satisfactory. The fitness center advertised on their website was nothing more than a small room with outdated equipment that barely worked. The \"continental breakfast\" they offered consisted of stale pastries and watery coffee. It was a far cry from the advertised \"deluxe breakfast buffet.\"As the days went by, I became increasingly eager to check out and put this terrible experience behind me. However, when I approached the front desk to settle my bill, I was met with yet another disappointment. Despite having pre-paid for my stay, they claimed that there were additional charges for \"incidentals\" that had not been covered.",

Let me start by saying that the ambiance of the restaurant was quite charming. The dim lighting and cozy atmosphere created a nice setting for a romantic dinner. However, the service was a bit lacking. Our waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the evening. It took quite a while for him to take our orders, and we had to constantly flag him down for drink refills.Moving on to the food, our appetizers were a mixed bag. The shrimp cocktail was fresh and flavorful, but the crab cakes were a letdown. They lacked the promised lump crab meat and were instead mostly filled with breadcrumbs. For the main course, I opted for the filet mignon, while my partner chose the salmon. The steak was cooked to perfection and had a nice sear, but it was lacking in seasoning. The salmon was flaky and moist, but it was served with a sauce that overpowered its natural flavors.One of the highlights of the meal was the side dishes. The garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious, and the sautéed mushrooms added a nice earthy touch. However, the asparagus was overcooked and limp. It was evident that attention to detail was lacking in the kitchen.When it came to dessert, we decided to try the cheesecake and the crème brûlée. The cheesecake was creamy and rich, with a perfectly buttery graham cracker crust. The crème brûlée, on the other hand, lacked the characteristic crackling sugar crust and seemed underwhelming in comparison.Overall, while the restaurant had its positive aspects, it fell short of my expectations. The lackluster service and inconsistency in the quality of the dishes left me underwhelmed. For the price we paid, I expected a more memorable dining experience.

They quickly got us set up with rental gear and gave us a brief orientation on the safety procedures. The climbing walls were impressive, with a wide range of routes catering to different skill levels. I particularly liked the variety of holds and creative route setting. It kept the climbing experience exciting and challenging. The bouldering area was a highlight as well, offering intricate problems that required both technique and strength. It was fun to see my friends tackle the routes and cheer each other on. However, as we spent more time at the gym, a few issues became apparent. The ventilation inside the gym was poor, making the air stuffy and humid. It became uncomfortable after a while, especially during intense climbing sessions. Additionally, the gym seemed to be understaffed, as it was sometimes difficult to find someone available for assistance or guidance. The cleanliness of the facility could have been better too, as there were some chalk spills and dirty mats that hadn't been tidied up. Despite these drawbacks, overall, we had a decent experience at the gym. It provided an enjoyable and challenging climbing session for me and my friends, and we appreciated the opportunity to bond over our shared interest.

However, after reading Darren's review, I decided to pay a visit to my local Kmart to see if it had changed much. As soon as I stepped inside, nostalgia hit me. The layout of the store was oddly familiar, with the wide aisles and fluorescent lighting adding to the retro atmosphere. It brought back memories of wandering through the aisles with my family, searching for bargains and discovering unexpected treasures. But as I began to explore further, I couldn't help but notice the store's decline. The shelves were sparsely stocked, and many of them were in disarray. It seemed like the store was struggling to keep up with the competition from online retailers and other big-box stores. The lack of variety in the product selection was disappointing as well. It felt as if Kmart hadn't kept up with the changing trends and demands of consumers. The clothing section, in particular, appeared outdated and lacked the fashionable options I had come to expect from other retailers. The customer service was also lacking. It was difficult to find an employee to assist with my inquiries, and when I did manage to locate one, they seemed disinterested and unhelpful. The checkout process was slow and frustrating, with long lines and malfunctioning registers. It was evident that Kmart was struggling to maintain its once-prominent position in the retail industry. Despite its shortcomings, there were some positives about my visit. The prices at Kmart were still relatively affordable, and I managed to find a few items that were decent quality for the price. Additionally, the store's location was convenient, with ample parking available. However, these small positives weren't enough to outweigh the overall decline of the store.

We started our meal with a bruschetta appetizer that was bursting with fresh flavors. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe, and the bread was toasted to perfection. For our main courses, we opted for the classic spaghetti carbonara and the osso buco. The carbonara was unlike any I had tasted before - the sauce was creamy and rich, and the pancetta added a delicious smokiness to the dish. The osso buco was tender and fell off the bone effortlessly, accompanied by a flavorful gremolata that elevated the flavors even further. The attention to detail and the use of quality ingredients truly shone through in every bite. To complement our meal, we enjoyed a bottle of Chianti that was recommended by our knowledgeable server. The wine paired perfectly with our dishes and added an extra layer of enjoyment to the evening. Despite being quite full, we couldn't resist trying some of the delectable desserts on offer.

The interior decor is outdated and in need of a revamp. It's not a place I would choose to linger and enjoy my coffee. The noise level is often too high, with customers talking loudly and the constant sound of blenders and espresso machines. The cleanliness of the store is questionable as well. I've seen dirty tables and spilled drinks that go unattended for far too long. It gives the impression that the staff lacks attention to detail.

However, instead of providing any assistance or understanding, she displayed a dismissive and condescending attitude. She barely let me finish explaining the issues we had encountered before interrupting me and insisting that there was nothing they could do.I couldn't believe the lack of customer service and the complete disregard for our safety. It was clear that AVIS - McCarren cared more about making a quick profit than ensuring their customers' satisfaction. The entire experience left a bitter taste in my mouth, and it was evident that they had no appreciation for the loyalty of their long-time customers.To make matters worse, there was a fuel charge of $20 on the bill, even though I had returned the car with a full tank. I politely pointed out the error to the agent who checked the car, but he rudely dismissed my concerns and insisted that I needed to speak with a manager. Given the limited time I had before my flight, I was extremely frustrated with this unnecessary hassle.",

The service was incredibly slow, and it took forever for someone to even acknowledge our presence. When we finally placed our orders, it took an eternity for the food to arrive at our table. To make matters worse, the quality of the dishes was subpar. I ordered the special of the day, expecting something unique and flavorful, but it was bland and uninspiring. The presentation was also lackluster, with dishes appearing thrown together and haphazardly arranged on the plates. It was clear that attention to detail was lacking in the kitchen. Moreover, the portion sizes were surprisingly small for the price we paid. I left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry. Another issue was the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables were sticky, and the floors looked like they hadn't been properly swept in days. It was not a pleasant environment to dine in. Additionally, the atmosphere was dull and uninviting. There was no background music or any effort to create a pleasant ambiance. It felt like we were eating in a cafeteria rather than a restaurant. The lack of attention to detail was evident in every aspect of the dining experience. Even the utensils and glassware seemed dirty and neglected. I regretted coming back for a second visit and wished I had chosen a different restaurant. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this place. The previous positive reviews I had read made me hopeful, but now I can't help but wonder if those reviews were genuine. Perhaps it was just an off day for the restaurant, but based on my experience, I cannot recommend it to others. There are far better options available in the area. I will not be returning, and I suggest looking elsewhere for a satisfying dining experience.",

The menu had a decent variety of options, ranging from classic pub fare to more unique dishes. On my first visit, I decided to try their famous burgers, and I must say, they did not disappoint. The patties were perfectly cooked to my liking, juicy and flavorful, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. The accompanying fries were crispy and seasoned just right. It was a satisfying meal that left me wanting to come back for more. nnDuring my second visit, I ventured into trying their wings, and I have to say, they lived up to the hype. The wings were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the sauces had just the right amount of heat and flavor. I particularly enjoyed their honey BBQ sauce, which had a nice balance of sweetness and tanginess. The portion sizes were generous, and the wings were served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing, completing the classic wing experience. nnIn addition to the food, the drink selection at this place is commendable. They have a wide range of beers on tap, including some local craft brews, as well as a decent selection of cocktails and other beverages. The prices were reasonable, and the staff was knowledgeable in recommending drinks that would complement our meals. Whether you're a beer connoisseur or prefer something else, they have options to satisfy different preferences. nnOverall, I had a great experience at this establishment. The quality of the food, coupled with the friendly service and welcoming ambiance, made it a place I would gladly revisit. Whether you're looking for a casual hangout spot or a place to grab a satisfying meal, Morty's is definitely worth a visit. I can see why it has become a favorite among locals and has stood the test of time.",

So, with high expectations, I ventured to the taco stand during my lunch break. As soon as I arrived, the aroma of freshly cooked meat filled the air, making my mouth water in anticipation. The stand was situated on a bustling street corner, with a colorful canopy providing shade for the customers. The menu hanging on the side displayed a variety of taco options, from classic choices to more adventurous fillings. I decided to try their specialty, the carne asada tacos. The friendly staff took my order and swiftly prepared my tacos right in front of me. The sizzling sound and the sight of the perfectly grilled meat made my taste buds tingle with excitement. The tacos were served on warm, soft tortillas and topped with generous servings of cilantro and onions. With the first bite, I was transported to flavor heaven. The tender and juicy steak combined with the freshness of the toppings created a burst of deliciousness in my mouth. Each subsequent bite was just as satisfying as the last. The flavors were well-balanced, and the homemade salsa added an extra kick of spiciness. I savored every bite, not wanting the experience to end. The atmosphere at the taco stand was lively and energetic, with a mix of locals and tourists enjoying their meals. The sound of laughter and conversations filled the air, adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience. The prices were incredibly affordable, allowing me to indulge in multiple tacos without breaking the bank. As I left the taco stand, I couldn't help but feel grateful for stumbling upon such a hidden gem. It was an unforgettable culinary adventure that left me craving more.

Sometimes the service is attentive and friendly, making you feel right at home, while other times it feels like the staff couldn't care less about your presence. The menu is extensive, offering a wide range of options to cater to different tastes, but the quality of the food varies as well. There have been occasions where I've ordered a dish and it's been absolutely delicious, bursting with flavors and perfectly cooked. However, there have also been instances where the food was bland, underseasoned, or overcooked. It's frustrating because you never know what you're going to get. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with dim lighting and comfortable seating, which creates a relaxed ambiance. On certain nights, they even have live music playing, further adding to the pleasant atmosphere. However, the noise level can get quite high, making it difficult to hold a conversation without raising your voice. Another issue I've encountered is the inconsistency in pricing. Some items on the menu seem reasonably priced, but others feel overpriced for what you're getting. It leaves me questioning whether the experience is worth the dent in my wallet. The drink selection is decent, with a variety of cocktails, wines, and beers to choose from. However, their mixed drinks can be hit-or-miss as well, with some being expertly crafted and others tasting watered down or unbalanced. The wait times can also be a concern, especially during peak hours. There have been instances where I've had to wait an unreasonable amount of time to be seated or to have my order taken. Overall, this place has the potential to be great, but it falls short in consistency and attention to detail. It's a gamble every time you decide to dine here, and while you might have a fantastic experience one visit, the next might leave you disappointed.",

The chicken was tender and well-seasoned, accompanied by sizzling vegetables and warm tortillas. The portion size was generous, and I was more than satisfied with my choice. My dining companion opted for the Baja Fish Tacos, and they were a hit as well. The fish was perfectly crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside, topped with a refreshing slaw and zesty sauce. We couldn't resist trying their signature margaritas, and they were worth every sip. The drinks were well-balanced and packed a punch of flavor. As for dessert, we indulged in their Churros with caramel sauce, and they were the perfect sweet ending to our meal.

The lack of energy from the chef affected the entire atmosphere at the table, making it feel dull and unengaging.Furthermore, the quality of the food was subpar compared to our previous visits. The ingredients didn't seem as fresh, and the flavors were underwhelming. The sushi rolls lacked creativity and tasted bland. Even the hibachi-grilled dishes, which are usually the highlight of the meal, were lackluster.

The place had a lively atmosphere, with sports memorabilia covering the walls and a bustling crowd. As we scanned the extensive menu, the sheer variety of sandwich options was overwhelming. Eventually, we settled on the classic Pittsburgher sandwich, piled high with grilled meat, coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries. The sandwiches took a bit longer to arrive than we expected, but we were glad to see the portions were generous. With the first bite, I was taken aback by the combination of flavors. The tangy coleslaw and crunchy fries added an interesting texture to the savory meat, all sandwiched between two thick slices of bread. It was undoubtedly a unique experience, but I found the sandwich to be a bit too heavy for my liking. The richness of the meat and the abundance of fries made it a challenge to finish. While the novelty factor was certainly there, I couldn't help but feel that the flavors didn't fully harmonize. Nevertheless, I appreciated the opportunity to try this Pittsburgh tradition. The service was friendly, and the staff seemed genuinely proud of their sandwiches.

They're also great for dipping in soup or chili.I've tried to make Red Lobster's biscuits at home, but they never turn out as good. I think it's because they have a special secret ingredient that they don't share with the public.One time, I ate so many Red Lobster biscuits that I got sick. But it was totally worth it.If you're ever in the mood for some delicious biscuits, I highly recommend going to Red Lobster.

It has old school charm and is smaller than most casinos. The casino is laid out so that you can see everything from one end to the other. Ding! Ding! Ding! Hit a jackpot on my first pull! The loosest slots in Vegas according to a local. If you don't win here you won't win anywhere.  For an older casino it has been updated nicely. The rooms are nice and clean with new furniture, flat screen TV's and granite counter tops.  The beds were really comfortable and had great pillows.  The bathroom was small but didn't feel cramped.  The shower was bigger than most hotel showers. The casino is in a great location right downtown on Fremont Street.  It is close to everything.  If you can book a room facing Fremont Street.  I loved watching the light show and people watching.  One night the Fremont Street Experience was having a party with music and dancing.  It was so much fun sitting on the balcony watching everyone having fun below.  We ate at the buffet for breakfast one morning.  It was a typical Vegas buffet.  The food was just average.  I would recommend trying one of the many restaurants nearby.  The Golden Gate has a great little coffee shop that is reasonably priced.  It has a 50's theme.  We had lunch there once and it was good. The servers and staff were very friendly and helpful.  They made us feel right at home.  It is nice to stay in a hotel that isn't huge and impersonal.  It was great hearing all the history of this hotel.  The bellman told us that the hotel was built by a man that made his millions during the gold rush in California.  He spared no expense on this hotel.  The safe in our room was the original safe from when the hotel was built.  There were even bullet holes in it.  I think it is really cool to stay in a place with so much history.",

We ordered our drinks and an appetizer of mozzarella sticks.We tried a few different types of pizza by ordering a few small pies. The margherita pizza was one of my favorites - just the right combination of cheese and sauce! The veggie pizza could have used a bit more flavor, but the crust is amazing. The sausage and pepperoni were very tasty. It wasn’t too greasy, and the ingredients tasted very fresh. We also ordered a side of garlic knots which were very good. They were a little oily, but soft and fluffy on the inside.Overall, it was a great experience. The food was great, but I have to say the customer service was above and beyond. When we first got there they were a little slow on getting our drinks, so they brought us some complimentary garlic knots while we waited. The waiter even brought my 3 year old out a little dough to play with to keep her occupied. We had such a good experience that we ordered some food to go to take home for later.I will definitely be going back to McHales!

It's been incredibly frustrating to deal with their lack of communication and follow-through. For example, I recently submitted a ticket for a technical issue and didn't receive a response for over a week. When I finally did hear back, the response was completely unhelpful and didn't address my issue at all. I've also had to call multiple times to follow up on requests, only to be put on hold for long periods of time or disconnected.It's really disappointing to see such a decline in Muzak's service, especially after being a loyal customer for so many years. I'm considering switching to another provider at this point because I can't afford to keep dealing with these issues.Another example of Muzak's poor service is when I tried to cancel my subscription. I called customer service and was told that I would need to send a written letter of cancellation. I did so, but then I continued to be billed for the service. When I called to inquire about this, I was told that they had never received my letter. I had to send it again, and then it took another two months for my subscription to be cancelled.I'm really disappointed with the way Muzak has handled my account.

I’m not sure if it’s the intelligent conversation or the soothing voices that make me feel this way, but for whatever reason I have always dreamed of being a part of it, even if it’s just a caller. And now my dream might finally come true!I recently discovered NPR’s “You Betcha” podcast. The podcast focuses on the cultural differences between people from Minnesota and people from elsewhere. As a born-and-raised Minnesotan, I have always been fascinated by the way people from other states seem to view the Upper Midwest. On this podcast, comedians and hosts Cari and Sam talk about everything from the accent to the food to the traditions we hold near and dear.Since I’ve been listening to “You Betcha,” I’ve been trying to find ways to work the show into my own life. I’ve been telling my friends about it, leaving reviews on iTunes, and even sending them story ideas. And then it hit me. What if I called in? Why not talk about something that Minnesotans will definitely have a unique take on? The Super Bowl!My biggest fear is that I won’t be funny enough. If you call into a show, you have to be funny, right? I listen to people call in all the time and crack me up. And even when they aren’t trying to be funny, they’re so inherently funny because of the way they’re talking or the stories they’re telling. And while I am pretty witty, I tend to clam up when I’m put on the spot. My mind always goes blank and I say something stupid. But you know what they say, nothing ventured nothing gained.So, with the big game happening this Sunday, I am going to call in to “You Betcha” and see if I can tell Cari and Sam all about Minnesota Super Bowl traditions.",

The oysters were lightly breaded and perfectly fried. They were huge and juicy. The clam chowder was creamy and delicious, full of clams. My daughter had the kid's perch, which she loved. My husband got the prime rib, which he said was some of the best he has ever had. The drinks were reasonably priced and strong. We will definitely be going back! My only complaint was that they ran out of perch by 6:45. I would suggest getting there earlier if you want perch.",

The produce is always wilted and the meat is freezer burned. The only thing they have going for them is that they're open 24 hours. But even that's not worth it. I'd rather go to the gas station for my groceries than this place.nnThe only reason I ever go there is because it's the only grocery store within walking distance. If I had a car, I would never set foot in that place again. I'm not sure how they stay in business. The only people who shop there are the ones who live in the apartments nearby and don't have any other options.nnI've been shopping there for years, and I've seen it go downhill. It used to be a decent store, but it's really gone to pot in the last few years. The new owners don't seem to care about the store at all. They're just running it into the ground.nnI'm really hoping that someone will buy the store and turn it around. It's such a shame to see a once-great store go to waste.

This time we had a \"deluxe\" room on the 17th floor, and it was not a good experience. We were originally assigned a room with a terrible view of an ally, but we called the front desk and they agreed to move us to a room with a better view of the strip - this room had a great view! However, the room was very small. The bathroom was also very small, with hardly any counter space. The shower didn't drain properly so after a few minutes in the shower the floor would be covered in water. The bed was very hard and the pillows were lumpy. The room was also not very clean - there was dust on the furniture and the sheets had stains on them. We also had issues with our keys not working properly. One time we had to wait over 20 minutes for maintenance to come and let us into our room. The staff was not very friendly or accommodating this time around. The check-in process took forever and the front desk staff was not very welcoming or helpful. We had a similar issue with the check-out process, the line was ridiculously long and the front desk staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. The only positive thing about this stay was the view from our room. The pool is also nice but it was very crowded and difficult to find a place to sit. Overall, this was a very disappointing experience and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

I also ordered a chocolate milkshake, which was more like a chocolate milk. It was not thick and creamy like I had hoped. The prices were too high for the quality of food that I received.

We ordered two full racks of ribs (dry rub and sauced), a side of burnt ends, baked beans, and cheesy corn. nnThe ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the dry rub was delicious. The sauce was good, too, but the dry rub was better. Not too spicy at all. The burnt ends had a great smoky flavor and the meat was nice and moist. The baked beans had a little kick to them, which was a nice surprise, and the cheesy corn was just plain good - nice and creamy with just the right amount of cheese. nnOverall, we really enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back. The food was great, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was fun and comfortable.nnWe were seated promptly, but we were not greeted by our server for 15 minutes. We ordered the burnt end appetizer, a full rack of ribs and two sides. After 40 minutes, our food still had not arrived and we had not been checked on. When the food arrived, it was only the ribs. When we finally caught the attention of our server and asked about the rest of our order, she said it would be out shortly. 15 minutes later, the appetizer finally arrived, but the sides were no where to be found.

The door swung open and the lady (who I later found out was the owner) rudely asked, \"Do you have an appointment?\" I responded yes and she replied, \"Well, we are running behind and it will be at least 15 minutes.\" I advised her I had an appointment and a massage appointment to make afterward. She rudely replied, \"Yea, I know you did but we are running behind.\" The tone she used with me was extremely rude and unprofessional. At that point I should have left but foolishly I stayed. She took me to the back and washed my hair then sat me down in a chair and left me for 25 minutes. At that point, I was extremely frustrated and decided to leave. I got up and went to the front and advised her I was leaving and she said, \"Fine\". She had no concept of customer service. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.

We took a look at the happy hour menu but were disappointed by the limited options. I ordered a beer that was on discount along with some chicken wings but found them to be overcooked and lacking in flavor. My companion got a burger sliders plate but said the meat seemed low quality. The bartender was friendly enough but appeared rushed. We did not end up staying long as we did not find the food or drink specials to be very good value. Overall it was an underwhelming experience and I do not think I would return, even for happy hour. There are probably better options in the area.",

The checkout process was slow due to only one cashier working at the time. Overall, if gas is the main priority it serves that purpose, but for general shopping another location may be a better choice due to quality and selection concerns. In the future, I may still come here for gas but will obtain other items from a store where products are fresher and the shopping experience is smoother sailing.

The food quality was superb - everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. We started with the bruschetta appetizer which was fresh and light. For our mains, we had the pork chop and salmon dishes which melted in our mouths. The pork was tender and flavorful while the salmon was moist and cooked to a perfect doneness. The sides were also tasty, especially the garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. Overall the meal was very reasonably priced for the high quality of ingredients and preparation. The ambiance of the restaurant was also nice - a comfortable but elegant interior design. I would certainly consider XYZ Restaurant a special occasion spot given the excellent cuisine and service. We left completely satisfied and full yet not overly stuffed. Based on this visit, XYZ Restaurant has easily become one of our favorite places to dine out in the area. I would highly recommend giving it a try for anyone seeking a top-notch dining experience.",

All of the staff had to multitask and work as a team to handle the high volume of business. I was kept on my toes having to remember orders and requests from multiple tables at once. The servers had to navigate the tight quarters efficiently to deliver meals and refills without getting in each other's way. Most of my coworkers were college students or recent grads like myself just looking for part-time work. The managers worked long hours to keep everything running smoothly during the rushes. At the end of each shift, we were all exhausted but felt good that we satisfied so many patrons. It was rewarding to see customers enjoying their meals and coming back time and time again.

The layout and decor looked much the same as I remembered, with the long bar area up front and more spacious seating and stages towards the back. There was a live band playing some good classic rock covers that had many people out on the dance floor. The atmosphere felt energetic but not too crowded or crazy. I got a beer from the bar and took a look at the menu, seeing their typical burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything seemed reasonably priced for a bar. My friend arrived and we got a table, chatting and enjoying the music for a while. Our food came out pretty quickly after ordering. The wings were tasty with a nice spicy sauce. More people kept filtering in as the night went on. We stayed for a few more songs then paid our tab, which was also reasonable. It was nice to revisit Buckhead Saloon after all these years and see it was still a reliable spot for a drink, music, and some grub on a weekend night. Not much seemed to have changed and it had held onto its appeal. I'd consider returning again next time I'm in the mood for that kind of low-key bar setting.",

The house special fried rice is always a reliable choice stuffed with shrimp, pork and vegetables. While the food won't win any awards for gourmet Chinese cuisine, it does the job for a filling meal on a busy weeknight. The staff is friendly and efficient at fulfilling orders.

I'll be sure to visit during less busy times in the future for a more relaxed dining experience. Overall, the quality of the ingredients made up for the busy atmosphere. I can see why this place remains popular despite service issues now and then. With some improved staff training, it could provide an even better experience for customers.",

It was colorfully plated and the flavors balanced well. The next course was lobster bisque that was rich and creamy without being too heavy. For the main entree, I selected the fish of the day which was branzino cooked perfectly with lemon. The mushroom risotto it was served atop was rich and flavorful. My partner had the braised short ribs that fell off the bone and were so tender. Both were excellent choices. We shared a bottle of pinot noir that paired nicely with the food. For dessert, we were brought the featured dessert which was a chocolate mousse with berries and whipped cream. It was the perfect light yet indulgent way to end the meal. Throughout the meal, our server checked on us regularly without being intrusive. When he wasn't at our table, he was efficiently helping other tables. The kitchen also did a great job with the timed service of each course. At the end of the meal, we felt fully satisfied but not overly full.

It's also nice that most concession stands stay open late so you can grab a snack even on red-eye flights. Wifi is available throughout the airport and generally pretty reliable. Signage is clear so you never feel unsure of where you need to go next. The staff are also very helpful if you do get turned around. I also appreciate the ample charging stations - it's one less thing to stress about during a long layover.

While it will take time for this young Hornets team to develop, they play with energy and hustle every night. Lance Stephenson has provided some flashes of star potential and Al Jefferson is a solid veteran presence. The Eastern Conference is deep this year but the Hornets have shown they can compete with just about anyone on any given night. If some of the younger players like Cody Zeller and Noah Vonleh continue to improve, the Hornets have a bright future.

The wait just to get through the checkpoint can take 30 minutes or more during peak times. Once you finally make it through, it's hard to find an open seat at the gate areas since they fill up quickly. You often end up sitting on the floor or standing the whole time waiting to board. The shops and restaurants are packed too, making it difficult to find a table to sit down and eat. You pretty much have to grab your food to-go if you want to avoid standing the whole time. Even using the restrooms is a challenge, as long lines frequently spill out the doors during busy periods. Finding a place to charge your phone can also be an issue with limited open power outlets.Parking is a nightmare if you're dropping someone off or picking them up. The designated waiting areas fill up fast, so yousometimes end up waiting in the arrival/departure lanes and blocking traffic. Navigating through the crowds with luggage is also tricky, as there always seems to be a bottleneck where large groups converge.The amount of announced delays and gate changes adds to the chaos as well. It's hard to keep track of your flight with so much activity happening all at once. The airlines also seem to pack all the departure times close together, ensuring a massive crowd is constantly rushing between terminals. During holidays or major events like conventions, the entire airport feels overly congested. Security lines stretch on for what feels like miles and customer service reps are swamped fielding questions. Finding a quiet spot to make a phone call is next to impossible with the constant loud background noise.Overall, the business is good for the airport but really tough on passengers who have to navigate the crowds on a regular basis.",

The second time I went, I was a bit disappointed. The jerk chicken was overcooked, and the rice and peas were underseasoned. The beef patty was also dry and tasteless. I was hoping it was just a bad day, so I decided to give it another try. The third time, I was glad to see that they had improved. The jerk chicken was back to its usual deliciousness, and the rice and peas were perfectly seasoned. The beef patty was still a bit dry, but it was better than the last time. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Jamaican food. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth trying.",

I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and attentive, always making sure my drink is full and my plate is clean. The menu has a great selection of sandwiches, salads, and soups. I usually stick to the classics, like the BLT or the grilled cheese, but I've tried a few of the specials and they're always delicious. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. I love that they use fresh, high-quality ingredients and make everything to order. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a warm and welcoming decor. It's a great spot for a casual lunch or a meetup with friends. I've never had to wait long for a table, even during peak hours. The servers are always efficient and friendly, making sure everything runs smoothly. The only downside is that it's a bit of a trek from my office, but it's worth the extra walk.

I've been living in Arizona for a few years now, and I have to say, I'm loving the change of pace. The weather is definitely a welcome change, and I'm enjoying the abundance of outdoor activities that are available year-round.One of my favorite things to do is hike, and Arizona has some of the most beautiful hiking trails I've ever seen. The Superstition Mountains are just a short drive from where I live, and I've hiked up to the top of Siphon Draw Trail a few times now. The views from the top are breathtaking, and it's a great workout.Another thing I love about Arizona is the food scene. There are so many amazing restaurants and food trucks, and I've been trying to try as many as possible. I'm a big fan of Mexican food, and there are some great places around here that serve delicious tacos, burritos, and other Mexican dishes.One of my favorite places is a food truck called America's Taco Shop. They have a variety of tacos, burritos, and other items, and everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious. The carne asada tacos are my favorite, and the salsa is fresh and flavorful. They also have a great atmosphere, with friendly staff and a quaint setting.I've also been to a few breweries in the area, and they're all great. SanTan Brewing Company is one of my favorites, and they have a great selection of beers. I'm a big fan of their Mr. Pyro's Apothecary Ale, and it's a great place to hang out and watch a game or meet with friends.Overall, I'm really enjoying my time in Arizona. The weather, the outdoor activities, the food scene, and the friendly people all make it a great place to live. I'm looking forward to exploring more of what the state has to offer and making new memories with my friends and family.",

We visited three restaurants during our trip, and each one exceeded our expectations.First, we went to La Maison, a French restaurant in the heart of the city. The atmosphere was elegant and intimate, with dark wood paneling and chandeliers. The service was impeccable, and the food was exceptional. We ordered the escargot, which was cooked to perfection, and the steak au poivre, which was tender and flavorful.Next, we visited The Wild Elephant, a Thai restaurant in the Strip District. The food was delicious, with bold and vibrant flavors. The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively and energetic. We especially enjoyed the Thai Red Curry, which had a nice balance of spicy and sweet.Finally, we went to Eleven, a contemporary American restaurant in the Cultural District. The decor was modern and chic, with a sleek bar and exposed brick walls. The service was professional and knowledgeable, and the food was creative and inventive. We ordered the burrata, which was served with fresh bread and a side of fruit, and the roasted beet salad, which was sweet and earthy.Overall, we were very impressed with the food scene in Pittsburgh. The city has a rich history and a vibrant cultural scene, and it's clear that the food reflects that. We would highly recommend any of the restaurants we visited to anyone looking for a great meal in the city.However, we do have one suggestion for improvement. At Eleven, we noticed that the menu was a bit limited, especially for vegetarians. It would be great to see more options for plant-based diners, as well as a wider variety of dishes to choose from.Despite this minor issue, we were thoroughly impressed with Pittsburgh's food scene, and we can't wait to come back and try more of what the city has to offer.",

On the one hand, the train is comfortable and the staff is usually friendly and helpful. The scenery along the route is also beautiful, especially when traveling through the Allegheny Mountains.However, the train's on-time performance has been inconsistent. There have been times when the train has been delayed by several hours, which can be frustrating, especially when you're trying to make connections. I've also noticed that the train's Wi-Fi can be spotty at times, which can be a problem if you need to work or stay connected during your trip.Another issue I've encountered is that the train's food and beverage service can be hit or miss. Sometimes the food is delicious and the selection is good, but other times it's been less than impressive. And don't even get me started on the prices - $5 for a small bag of peanuts? Really?Despite these issues, I still prefer taking the train over driving or flying. It's a more relaxing way to travel, and you can't beat the views. I just wish Amtrak would work on improving their on-time performance and amenities.Overall, I would give the Pennsylvanian train a solid 3 out of 5 stars. It's not perfect, but it's still a good option for those who want to travel in comfort and style. Just be sure to bring your own snacks and entertainment, just in case.",

I sampled a few of the creme brulees, which were creamy and flavorful, and the mango ice cream, which was a refreshing way to end my meal.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by The Buffet at Wynn. The food was good, the atmosphere was lively, and the service was attentive and friendly. It was definitely worth the Groupon price, and I would consider coming back again in the future.",

The restaurant is small and cozy, with a homey atmosphere that makes you feel like you're dining in someone's kitchen. The decor is simple but charming, with red and white checkered tablecloths and a few Italian posters on the walls. The service is always friendly and attentive, with a warm and welcoming smile from the staff.The menu offers a range of options, from classic Italian dishes like spaghetti carbonara and lasagna, to more modern creations like pumpkin ravioli and eggplant parmesan. The ingredients are always fresh and of high quality, with a focus on locally sourced produce and meats. The portions are generous, so you'll never leave feeling hungry.I've tried several dishes at Girasole, and every single one has been delicious. The pasta is cooked to perfection, with a nice balance of flavors and textures. The sauces are rich and full-bodied, with a depth of flavor that is hard to find elsewhere. The pizza is also excellent, with a crispy crust and a flavorful sauce that is made fresh daily.The best part about Girasole is the price. For the quality of food and service you receive, the prices are incredibly reasonable. You can get a filling and delicious lunch for under $15, which is a great value in my opinion.Overall, I highly recommend Girasole for a quick and delicious lunch in a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It's a hidden gem that is worth seeking out, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

The Lettuce Wraps were a nice surprise, they were fresh and flavorful, but the portion size was a bit small.The Dolsot Bi Bim Bap was a letdown, the rice was overcooked and the vegetables were lackluster. The Vietnamese Beef Noodles were a bit of a surprise, they were flavorful and the beef was cooked well, but the noodles were a bit too soft.The service was friendly, but a bit slow, it took a while to get our food and even longer to get the check.

The food is definitely good, and the vegetarian options are plentiful. Just be prepared for a bit of a wait for your food, and don't expect the most luxurious atmosphere.",

The staff is friendly, but they don't seem to take their job very seriously. I've seen them chatting with friends while ignoring customers, and the place can get pretty dirty. The tables are always sticky, and there's always crumbs and trash on the floor. Despite this, the bakery is popular with locals, and the prices are reasonable. If you're in the area, it's not a bad option, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

Gone are the crayons and butcher paper, replaced by sleek, modern decor and a sophisticated atmosphere. The menu, too, has undergone a transformation, with dishes that are both familiar and innovative. Despite the changes, the restaurant still maintains a cozy, welcoming atmosphere, perfect for a night out with friends or a romantic evening.",

The staff are friendly and helpful, always greeting you with a smile and making sure your experience is top-notch. The sound and picture quality are also exceptional, making you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. One of the things that sets this theater apart is its commitment to showing independent and foreign films, which can be hard to find in a sea of blockbuster franchises. It's clear that the theater is passionate about bringing unique and diverse stories to its audience. I've had the pleasure of seeing some incredible movies here that I wouldn't have been able to see otherwise. The only downside is that the theater can be a bit pricey, but for the level of quality and service you receive, it's well worth it. Overall, this theater is a true gem and a must-visit for any film lover.",

I've been to several parks in the Las Vegas area, but none have been as impressive as Cosmo. The park is well-maintained, with lush green grass and plenty of shade trees. There are several walking trails that wind through the park, making it easy to get some exercise while enjoying the beautiful surroundings. The lake is also a great spot to relax and take in the scenery. I've seen plenty of people fishing and boating on the lake, and it's a popular spot for picnics and barbecues. One thing that really stands out about Cosmo is the dog park. My pup loves running around and playing with the other dogs, and the park is well-equipped with agility training equipment and plenty of space to run around. Overall, Cosmo is a great spot to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy some fresh air and nature.",

I've had better Italian food at a chain restaurant. The atmosphere is trying too hard to be quirky and endearing, but it ends up feeling forced and uncomfortable. The service is slow and unfriendly, and the prices are way too high for the quality of food you receive. I was excited to try this place out, but I left feeling disappointed and ripped off.I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, which was served with a side of marinara sauce that tasted like it came straight from a jar. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, and the meatballs were dry and flavorless. I was expecting a rich, hearty dish that would fill me up and leave me feeling satisfied, but instead I felt like I had just eaten a bland, forgettable meal.My friend ordered the chicken parmesan, which was also a disappointment. The chicken was overcooked and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours, and the sauce was too sweet and sticky. The garlic bread that came with it was the highlight of the meal, but that's not saying much.I was hoping that the desserts would redeem the meal, but they were a letdown as well. The cannoli was filled with a bland, sweet ricotta cheese that had no flavor or texture, and the tiramisu was a soggy, falling-apart mess. I left feeling disappointed and frustrated, wishing I had chosen a different restaurant for my night out.I've heard that this place has a great atmosphere, but I didn't find that to be the case. The decor was tacky and over-the-top, with too many old Italian posters and cheap trinkets cluttering up the walls. The tables were cramped and uncomfortable, and the whole place felt like it was trying too hard to be something it's not.I've also heard that the service here is top-notch, but that wasn't my experience. Our server was slow and unfriendly, and it took forever to get our food and drinks.",

We had heard about Sports Rock Cafe from a friend, and we decided to give it a try. As we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to our table. The atmosphere was lively and energetic, with plenty of TVs showing different sports games. We ordered a few drinks and appetizers to start, and we were impressed by the prompt and friendly service. The menu had a great selection of pub-style food, and we were eager to try some of the local favorites. We ended up ordering a few burgers and sandwiches, along with some wings and fries. The food was delicious and satisfying, and we enjoyed every bite. Overall, we had a great experience at Sports Rock Cafe and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and lively sports bar in Pittsburgh.",

It's not trying to be flashy, but you can tell they put thought into every detail. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and he made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. Now, onto the food. We ordered the Tom Yum soup, and it was love at first sip. It was perfectly spicy, and the flavors were so well-balanced. I could taste the freshness of the lemongrass and lime leaves. It was a true taste of Thailand. We also got the Pad Thai, and let me tell you, it was the best I've ever had. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness. And the shrimp! Oh, the shrimp. They were huge and juicy, and they added such a great texture to the dish. We also tried the Green Curry, and it was creamy and rich, with a nice subtle spiciness. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the bell peppers were still crunchy. And don't even get me started on the sticky rice. It was like a little piece of heaven in every bite. I could go on and on about the food, but let's just say that this place is a must-try for any Thai food lover. It's authentic, delicious, and just all-around amazing. I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes. This place truly is Top Tier Thai.",

The prices are also comparable, but I do think BJ's is a bit cheaper. The thing I don't like about BJ's is that they don't have as many locations as Sam's Club. I also don't like that they don't take American Express, which is my preferred credit card. The selection of products is also not as vast as Sam's Club, but they do have most of what I need. The customer service is also not as good as Sam's Club, but it's not horrible either. Overall, I would say that BJ's is a good option if you're looking for a warehouse club experience, but it's not as good as Sam's Club.",

The tomato was also mealy. When I asked for a refill on my drink, it took a long time and the server seemed annoyed. The beer selection is extensive, but the unique brews are not worth the high prices. While the location is convenient for a pre-movie meal, the food and service do not justify the high prices. Yard House is a better option for a dining experience and craft beer. Overall, Rock Bottom is not worth the hype and I would not recommend it for a satisfying meal.",
