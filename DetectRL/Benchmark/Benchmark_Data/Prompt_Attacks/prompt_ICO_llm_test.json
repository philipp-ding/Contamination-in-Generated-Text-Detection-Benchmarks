TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison.

The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation.

The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere.

The stability and the bifurcations of the three typical orbits are studied, and the corresponding bifurcations in parameter spaces are given.",

Beryllium is usually observed in the optical wavelength range, but interstellar lines severely limit the determination of Be abundances in field stars. To mitigate this problem, we observed the near-infrared Be II 1.688 μm line in three open clusters of different ages and metallicities: NGC 2516, the Hyades, and M67.

We construct joint application networks for Japanese patents from 1992 to 2018 and analyze the spatial distribution of patent citations. Our findings suggest that patent citations exhibit a clear geographical bias, with a higher likelihood of citations between patents filed in the same prefecture. Furthermore, we observe a significant correlation between the spatial proximity of inventors and the frequency of patent citations, indicating the importance of geographical proximity in fostering knowledge spillovers. Additionally, our analysis reveals that joint application networks play a crucial role in bridging the gap between academia and industry, as patents filed by universities and public research institutions are more likely to be cited by patents filed by companies. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of spatial factors in understanding the dynamics of knowledge diffusion and collaboration in the Japanese patent system.",

We investigate the presence of modified p-modes (p-mode oscillations that have underwent mode conversion) in penumbral filaments using high resolution spectro-polarimetric observations of a sunspot obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Our observations reveal distinct polarized signatures in the photospheric layers of some penumbral filaments that show evidence of outward propagating waves with periods around 3 minutes. Forward modeling of the observations using radiative transfer computations indicates that these signatures are consistent with the presence of magneto-acoustic sausage or kink modes that have undergone mode conversion from inwardly propagating p-modes. The observed wave characteristics vary between different penumbral filaments.

Numerical solutions of the stochastic Schrodinger equations reveal collapse proceeds via oscillatory regimes, with plasma compression enhancing both gravitational and EM field excitations.

By reformulating the entanglement entropy as the expectation value of a quantum field in the bulk using the replica trick, we develop a prescription that is manifestly covariant under general coordinate transformations in the asymptotic anti-de Sitter region.

We account for variations in optical depth and spin temperature along different sightlines through the disk. The resulting 3D distribution of HI is used to map the vertical density profile of gas at different Galactocentric radii.

This paper derives and analyzes a strict parameter-dependent version of the KYP inequality for discrete passive time-invariant systems described by their transfer function matrices. Using finite dimensional projections and alternating projections, we obtain successively tighter relaxations of the inequality that allow characterization of the boundary of the passive sector. Specifically, the derived inequality relates the imaginary part of the transfer function matrices to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in the system matrices. Through manipulation of the LMIs, the KYP condition provides a frequency-domain test for passivity that can be evaluated via semidefinite programming. Our analysis generalizes previous results on continuous-time passive systems to the discrete-time domain, thereby extending the applicability of KYP inequalities to a broad class of parameterized dynamical systems.",

Through linear stability analysis, we characterize the parameter space where traveling wave solutions manifest and examine their dependence on the alpha viscosity parameter and cooling wave propagation speed. Notably, long period cycles only arise for modest viscosity values and intermediate cooling rates. Furthermore, we identify both stationary and migrating thermal fronts associated with the limit cycle oscillations. Our numerical solutions reveal hysteretic behavior between the hot and cool branches accompanied by coning of the heating and cooling waves. We assess implications for observed outburst light curves and quiescent timescales based on variation of model parameters within astrophysically motivated ranges. Overall, our work establishes the viability of a traveling wave framework for elucidating the nonlinear physics responsible for the limit cycle behavior of accretion disks across mass accretion scales.",

The diocotron instability is a well-known phenomenon that occurs in plasmas under the influence of magnetic fields and electric currents, leading to the formation of high-frequency electromagnetic waves. In the context of pulsars, this instability can have a significant impact on the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star.Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we explore the effects of relativistic effects on the diocotron instability in a pulsar's electrosphere. Our results show that relativistic effects can significantly modify the dispersion relation of the instability, leading to a stabilisation of the diocotron mode.We find that the stabilisation mechanism is due to the relativistic modification of the plasma frequency, which increases with the strength of the magnetic field. This increase in plasma frequency leads to a decrease in the growth rate of the instability, ultimately resulting in its stabilisation.Our results have important implications for the understanding of the electromagnetic emission from pulsars. In particular, we show that the stabilisation of the diocotron instability can lead to a decrease in the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star.We also explore the effects of various parameters, such as the strength of the magnetic field and the plasma density, on the stabilisation of the diocotron instability.

The WENO scheme is well-known for its ability to capture discontinuities and shocks in hyperbolic conservation laws, while general relativity provides a fundamental description of gravity and its effects on matter and energy. By marrying these two approaches, WHAM enables accurate and efficient simulations of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including black hole accretion, neutron star mergers, and supernovae explosions.The key innovation of WHAM lies in its ability to handle complex spacetime geometries and matter dynamics in a unified manner. Unlike traditional numerical schemes that rely on simplified approximations or assumptions, WHAM takes into account the full complexity of general relativity, allowing it to capture subtle effects such as gravitational waves, frame-dragging, and the coupling between matter and gravity. This is achieved through a careful adaptation of the WENO scheme to the curved spacetime environment, which enables accurate resolution of discontinuities and shocks even in the presence of strong gravitational fields.We demonstrate the capabilities of WHAM by applying it to a series of challenging test problems, including the collapse of a massive star, the merger of two neutron stars, and the rise of a jet from a black hole accretion disk. In each case, WHAM shows superior performance compared to existing numerical schemes, capturing the subtle interplay between matter and gravity with unprecedented accuracy and fidelity.

The membrane protein beta-dystroglycan is indispensable for the proper anchorage of utrophin and DP116; however, little is known about how its processing affects this interaction. The aim of this study was to investigate how beta-dystroglycan processing influences utrophin/DP116 anchorage in Schwann cell membranes, both in normal and muscular dystrophy (MDX) mouse models. To address this, we used biochemical isolation of Schwann cell membranes, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting techniques. Our results demonstrate that in normal mice, beta-dystroglycan processing significantly enhances the association of utrophin and DP116 with the Schwann cell membrane. In contrast, in MDX mice, which exhibit a severe muscular dystrophy phenotype, utrophin/DP116 anchorage is impaired, and this is accompanied by abnormalities in beta-dystroglycan processing. We propose that proper beta-dystroglycan processing is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Schwann cell membrane and ensuring proper anchorage of utrophin and DP116.

The advective-acoustic cycle, which couples the fluid motions and sound waves, is also found to be an important mechanism in the core, with acoustic waves generating turbulence and affecting the neutrino transport. We investigate the impact of these processes on the supernova's explosive dynamics and nucleosynthesis, and find that they lead to significant variations in the abundances of certain elements. Our results provide new insights into the complex physics of supernovae and highlight the importance of multidimensional simulations in understanding these spectacular astrophysical events.",

One of the most intriguing phenomena in these networks is the occurrence of cascading behavior, where a small perturbation in a node's state can trigger a chain reaction that spreads throughout the network. This paper examines the phenomenon of cascading behavior in large blog graphs, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive it.The authors begin by presenting a novel method for identifying influential nodes in large blog graphs. These nodes, termed \"opinion leaders,\" play a crucial role in the dissemination of information and the initiation of cascades. The authors demonstrate that opinion leaders can be identified using a combination of degree centrality and clustering coefficient, and that they are more likely to be found in certain communities or subgraphs within the network.Once opinion leaders have been identified, the authors investigate the conditions under which they are most likely to initiate a cascade. They find that the likelihood of a cascade increases when the number of influenced neighbors exceeds a certain threshold, and that the threshold varies depending on the strength of the social ties between nodes.The authors also explore the role of network structure in the propagation of cascades. They show that certain network properties, such as the degree distribution and the presence of community structures, can significantly impact the spread of cascades. Specifically, they find that networks with a power-law degree distribution and a strong community structure are more susceptible to cascading behavior.The authors validate their findings using a series of simulations on real-world blog graph data.",

The study employs a numerical approach, utilizing simulations to model the spread of information or diseases on such networks. The results demonstrate that the diffusion process is significantly affected by the distance-dependent probability of links, with the presence of long-range connections altering the diffusion dynamics. Specifically, the simulations show that the diffusion rate accelerates with increasing probability of long-range links, ultimately approaching the same rate as that of a fully connected network. However, the diffusion process becomes slower as the distance between nodes increases, indicating that the presence of long-range links does not entirely eliminate the effect of distance. Furthermore, the study reveals that the position of the initial node significantly influences the diffusion process, with nodes located near the center of the network displaying higher diffusion rates than those near the periphery.

In this study, we present millimeter and radio observations of a sample of z~6 quasars, using a combination of telescopes and cutting-edge instrumentation. Our observations reveal the presence of dense gas and dust in the quasar host galaxies, which suggests that these objects are undergoing rapid star formation and accretion. The radio observations also show evidence of jet activity, which is likely to be linked to the growth of the supermassive black hole at the quasar's center. We further find that the millimeter and radio luminosities of the quasars are positively correlated, indicating that they are both powered by the accretion of material onto the black hole. Our results provide new insights into the physical processes at play in z~6 quasars and highlight the importance of multiwavelength observations in understanding the nature of these enigmatic objects.\"",

The proposed model is based on a scalar damage variable and incorporates the effects of both plastic flow and damage in a unified framework. The model's predictions are validated through a series of numerical simulations, which demonstrate its ability to accurately capture the anisotropic behavior of concrete under various loading conditions. The model's simplicity and computational efficiency make it an attractive tool for practical applications, such as structural assessment and design. Moreover, the presented model can be used to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as material properties and loading conditions, on the behavior of concrete in principal directions. This study contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient methods for modeling the behavior of concrete, and has important implications for the design and analysis of concrete structures.",

Using a sample of 150 stars with known ages, we measured the radial and tangential velocities and found a significant correlation between velocity and age. The stars were divided into three age groups: young (<1 Gyr), intermediate (1-5 Gyr), and old (>5 Gyr). We found that the young stars have higher radial velocities than the intermediate and old stars, indicating that they are still contracting and evolving. The intermediate and old stars, on the other hand, have similar radial velocities, suggesting that they have reached a stable state. We also found a positive correlation between tangential velocity and age, indicating that the older stars have higher tangential velocities. Our results provide insights into the kinematic evolution of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and can be used to improve models of star formation and galaxy evolution.",

The CIV effect refers to the process by which neutral atoms are ionized by low-energy photons, resulting in a marked decrease in the gas-phase abundance of certain elements. Using a combination of observations and modeling, we investigate the conditions under which the CIV effect occurs and explore the possibility of detecting the resulting continuum emission. Our results suggest that the CIV effect may be observable in specific astrophysical environments, such as in the vicinity of stars or in regions of high radiation intensity. We propose strategies for detecting the continuum emission associated with the CIV effect and discuss the implications of such a detection for our understanding of interstellar chemistry and radiation physics. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering the CIV effect in studies of interstellar processes and underscores the potential for future research in this area.",

We weren't trying to hide anything.

Once they're up and running, they'll produce the income we need to turn profitable.\"He added: \"Time will be our friend on this.\"Since it began lending in 2012, the bank has committed £1.3bn to green projects, with £3.5bn committed from private investors, it said.When completed, the schemes aim to save 3.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, and produce enough clean energy to power three million homes.The bank has also unveiled plans to raise £1bn for a new fund to invest in offshore wind schemes.WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said the plans could create up to 28,000 jobs in Scotland.He said: \"Plans for a new billion pound fund to help support the deployment of offshore wind is an excellent initiative that will help create jobs, cut carbon and keep the nation's lights on.\"Studies estimate that, for Scotland, alone the offshore wind industry could create 28,000 jobs by 2020 and contribute over £7bn of investment to the economy.\"",

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Improvements in diagnosis and treatment are thought to be the reason.The death rate for men fell 12% and for women by 8%, narrowing the gender gap.But the actual number of cancer deaths rose - from 155,000 in 2003 to 162,000 in 2013 - as more people live longer and develop the disease in old age.\"The population is growing, and more of us are living longer,\" Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar said.Almost half of all the cancer deaths in 2013 were from lung, bowel, breast or prostate cancer.Although the combined death rate for these four cancers had dropped by about 11% over the past 10 years, some other cancers, such as liver and pancreatic, had increased death rates.Sir Harpal said: \"Too many people are still being diagnosed with and dying from cancer, not just here in the UK but around the world.\"He said CRUK was focusing research on how to achieve earlier diagnosis and manage hard-to-treat cancers.\"Our scientists are developing new tests, surgical and radiotherapy techniques, and drugs,\" he said.\"It's important to celebrate how much things have improved, but also to renew our commitment to saving the lives of more cancer patients.\"Cancer Research UK compiled the cancer death rate data, which was taken from cancer registries in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

This is almost as many as the UK (30), France (27) and Germany (23) combined.The full list will be published on Monday at a conference in Leipzig, Germany.The top500 list is a widely-recognised barometer of the state of worldwide supercomputing. It has been published twice yearly since 1993.All the computers are measured against the same criteria - a benchmark first devised in 1979 but since improved as computing has become ever more sophisticated.Such is the immense power of the supercomputers, their computational ability is measured in petaflop/s - quadrillions of calculations per second.The top performing computer, Tianhe-2, had its power measured at 33.86 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second). It has been just five years since IBM's Roadrunner became the first computer to break the 1 petaflop/s mark. That machine was shut down in 2013 due to excessive power consumption.The entire top 500 list of supercomputers combined offered 274 petaflop/s.Tianhe-2 is owned by the Chinese government and operated by the National University of Defence Technology. It is used as a \"research and educational\" tool.",

Some said they could not be bothered, while others were afraid of intimidation or embarrassed.A new guide to help students avoid being overcharged contains tips on how to take a meter reading, shopping around to get the best utility deals,  querying high bills and how to report faults, keep records of conversations and complain.Broadband packages are another minefield, says the guide, so students are advised to check the length of contracts, whether they are transferable, and to be aware of any limits on the amount of data they can download - even with so-called \"unlimited\" deals.To avoid losing deposits for damage caused by previous tenants, they are advised to check tenancy agreements and take inventories and photographs when they first move in.\"We want to ensure that all students are able to stand up for their rights and speak out when things go wrong, whether that is being asked to pay for a bill from a previous tenant or paying for damage they did not do,\" said Mr Shand Smith.\"Students should not be losing money, simply because they don't know their rights or are not making a fuss.\"",

More than 140 people died last month when another train derailed near Kanpur.In July a train smashed into a van full of schoolchildren at a level crossing, killing eight of them.The cause of the latest accident is not yet known and an inquiry has been ordered.The derailment happened when the train was crossing a bridge over a dry canal. Eyewitnesses told local TV channels that there was dense fog when the carriages derailed.\"Our coach tilted to one side. I jumped out and saw a few coaches were derailed,\" passenger Rizwan Chaudhary told the Associated Press.Last year, the government announced investments of $137bn (Â£111bn) over five years to modernise and expand the railways.",

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

Bush also admitted possessing 71 images of bestiality.Bush was arrested on suspicion of illegally importing protected species following information from UK Border Force.Det Con Sarah Bailey, of the Met's Wildlife Crime Unit, said: \"This case shows that strong controls are in place to protect endangered species and the police will take action against anyone found to be trading illegally.\"Illegal trade threatens many species' survival. I would urge anyone who sees specimens from protected wildlife for sale to contact police. We are committed to ensuring that anyone in London who is trading illegally in endangered animal parts is stopped.\"Grant Miller from the border force agency CITES said the illegal movement of endangered species was \"often cruel\" and those trading in illegal wildlife products would be targeted \"at the UK border and beyond\".He said Bush's supplier in Indonesia had been referred to the East Java police.A confiscation hearing is due to take place in April.",

Supporters of assisted dying argue that it gives people with terminal illnesses the option to end their lives with dignity and on their own terms. Opponents of assisted dying argue that it is wrong to legalize assisted dying, as it could lead to abuse and that it is not a compassionate response to people with terminal illnesses.The Isle of Man's decision not to legalize assisted dying is a reminder that the issue is still far from settled.",

Over 250,000 avid cycling fans lined the roads to cheer on the peloton as it tackled the opening road stage around Leeds. Team Sky controlled the front of the leading group for much of the 189 kilometer route as they looked to set up pre-race favorites Nicolas Roche and Adam Yates. A breakaway group of six riders managed to get away early on and battled for the King of the Mountains jersey at the first categorized climb of Ilkley Moor. As the undulating Yorkshire Dales roads took their toll on the peloton in the latter stages, Anthony Turgis of Côte d'Azure attacked from the peloton and bridged over to the breakaway. Turgis then launched a searing acceleration on the final ascent of Cray that only Steven Kruijswijk of LottoNL-Jumbo could answer. The pair then contested the stage victory in a dramatic sprint finish, with Turgis prevailing by less than a bike length to take the first yellow jersey. Roche was unable to match the pace of the leaders on the final climb and lost 12 seconds but retained second place overall. Despite the peloton splintering on the testing climbs, a bunch sprint still occurred for fourth place which was won by Elia Viviani. All the remaining overall contenders finished together, led home by Yates who remains third overall just six seconds off the overall lead now held by Turgis. Organisers will be delighted with the incredible crowds that turned out across Yorkshire for the opening stage of this new race.",

Steinbrueck, who leads the Social Democratic Party in its challenge of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, was photographed making an obscene hand gesture this weekend. The incident occurred as Steinbrueck was leaving a campaign event in Hannover on Saturday evening. A local photographer managed to capture the former finance minister flipping his middle finger in the direction of waiting journalists and photographers. The photo quickly spread on social media and was picked up by major newspapers on Sunday. Steinbrueck's office initially declined to comment on the image, but he later apologized for the \"inappropriate gesture.\" Chancellor Merkel said the rude hand signal was \"regrettable\" and \"not worthy of an experienced politician.\" Steinbrueck is hoping to unseat Merkel and her center-right bloc after 12 years in power. But the opposition leader now risks facing a backlash and losing voter support over the incident ahead of September's parliamentary elections. Steinbrueck had been gaining traction in polls recently by campaigning on a platform attacking Merkel's leadership. However, the controversy could undermine his momentum and messaging in the critical final months of campaigning.",

According to officials with the Tokyo Fire Department, the three-alarm blaze erupted just after 10pm in one of the facility's main production warehouses that houses a collection of rare and endangered herpetological specimens preserved from locations across Asia and the South Pacific. \"The flames spread extraordinarily fast given how dry the wooden racks and platforms used to store and mount the specimens were,\" said chief fire investigator Hiroaki Sato, who noted the immediate cause of the fire remains under scrutiny. Though over one hundred firefighters battled the roaring flames throughout the night, a large portion of the prized collection was unable to be saved from the searing heat. Plant manager Atsushi Yamada expressed his devastation at the significant loss, saying decades of research and collaboration were housed within the collection. In addition to the destroyed specimens, a portion of the warehouse structure and surrounding equipment sustained heavy damage from the blaze before it was contained around 4am. No injuries have been reported thus far, but officials are still examining the site to determine the full scope of the losses.",

According to the organization's findings, a staggering 38 million children under five years of age in India suffer from stunted growth, representing the highest numbers in the world. Where swathes of the country still lack access to clean water or even basic sanitation, young lives are being stunted from the very outset as a direct consequence of poor WASH facilities. The report warns that if actions are not taken promptly to address these alarming shortfalls, it will have disastrous impacts not only on individual well-being, but also the country's health outcomes and economic productivity for decades to come. While the issue disproportionately impacts rural areas where essential supplies and nutrition cannot reach those most affected by the conflict, experts stress this is first and foremost a protection crisis that should shame the nation into urgent action. As monsoon season gets underway exacerbating waterborne illness, the international community will be watching closely to see what steps India's leaders take to ensure every child may grow to their full height and potential.",

According to recent research, a tailored strategy that takes into account an individual's unique genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors is more effective in addressing the complex issue of obesity. By analyzing data from over 150,000 participants, scientists have identified distinct subgroups of obesity, each requiring a different intervention. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand and treat obesity, improving health outcomes for millions of people worldwide.

About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face.

Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began.

We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

A wisp of blonde hair had escaped her suit' s hood and billowed about, tendrils of ice forming on the strands. \" Sorry to leave this ice cube? \" Deshler asked over his suit' s comm-unit. * \" No, not really, \" * answered Ryzhkina. * \" My ancestors came from Siberia, or so I' m told. They were Cossacks. \" * Deshler nodded, aware that the gesture was lost in the suit' s fur lined hood. This world was a far cry from his childhood home of Ryerson with its expansive forests and numerous rivers. Its polar regions were paltry, temperate things compared to Conarky' s, and although the taiga to the south made a welcome change of pace it was a poor substitute for Ryerson' s mixed forests. Without speaking, they both turned and started back towards the waiting dropship, its cargo already loaded and ready to go. The life of a mercenary was one of impermanence, cast adrift by fate and chance to follow the drum. They' d seen scores of worlds, each more different than the last. Who knew if they' d ever return to this one?",

My watch ticked just past four when I got there. A beautiful place, to be sure - isolated, expensive - cold, too. The cold was the problem, and I was the solution. I trudged up the steps, leaving footprints in light powder, and knocked. And knocked. And knocked. I began to get uneasy then. A night without heat could get bad in the mountains, and even though I had made it there as fast as I could, I got uneasy. I had spoken to the client just before eleven the night before - it had taken me a good five hours to reach the mountain home, even while pushing the speed limit as much as I could. Long story short, no one was home. I found the problem quickly - a few wires got crossed the wrong way the furnace, and I was on my way. I did n' t really notice anything was wrong until I got back to the city. I got progressively more worried the closer to home I got - my girlfriend had n' t text me so much as a \" good morning \". And there was no one on the road. No one. Not unusual coming out of the mountains, but in the city... lights were on, traffic signals directed nothing, and I could n' t see any signs of inexplicable disasters. It' s been silent since then. I think it' s been three days, but I ca n' t be sure, because the sun is starting to not set. Without my phone I' d lose track of time completely. Surfing Reddit was useless, except for confirming that everyone was gone. I got one email. I have n' t responded. It was to an email that I forgot was connected to my phone, one from high school. \" Is anyone there? \" I remember the girl who sent that email. She was the reason I left, and never looked back.

He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself. Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie' s car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I' d taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead. It was n' t the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me. The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I' d cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I' d made the last hour of many men' s lives slightly better. I could n' t imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make. Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up. Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work. -- - Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer' s cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face. He was crying. I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \" I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry.

Tonight, we will see the end of a nation, an ideal, and a way of life. Still, we stand strong in the face of complete and assured death, not because we are too weak to retaliate, but because we' re strong enough not to. Our chapter is at its end. The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end. Are we really so vain to believe that just because a nation dies, all of mankind must perish? Are we really so arrogant to trust in our ideal of equality that the whole world must die?

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

She screamed as she leaned over *our sons* limp body. I knew this was a lie too, but I pretend it was n' t. The boy had emotional issues, and I tried to help him, but the bitch would never admit that. I remember her father, at the funeral, the way the tears streamed from his face, as he quietly agreed with my now ex-wife, that it was in fact, my fault. I remember agreeing with him, and leaving when his wife told me I should n' t be there. I remember all of these things, and I pretend they are true, though I know they are not. I did n' t feel a thing, when I shot that young arab boy. Even when I found out he was a civilian, I remember laughing with my men, it was a hell of a headshot. I do n' t feel much of anything. When I pretend they were right, I finally feel. It gives me the fuel to keep going, and it' s given me the passion I need. Look at me now. A hero, they call me. I remember it like yesterday. It was the day I left home. No, it was the day I left for home. Not a soldier, not even close, just inspired me to be... dark, I guess.",

I decided that I truly wanted it. Countless nights of suffering, nightmares, panic at the slightest danger. I breathed in, and knocked on the door. It was a drab, indescript thing, and it filled me with panic - like so many other things in my life. A wizened man stood at the door, smiling upon me, as if I was a sweet child, visiting door to door and handing out presents. \" What brings you to me? \", he asked, curious. \" I came to forget. \", I said, blinking back tears. This was an ending, one that I would forget. A tear rolled down my cheek, and I brushed it away. \" Are you sure? \", the man said, suddenly seeming frail, and somewhat... weak. \" I' ve had my moments of thinking, walking here.

He was going to do this right; and so he planned. His struggles surely were not from a lack of trying. At the very least he could hold onto that thought until the end. After trying for years to battle past his descending mind, he had finally gotten his life in order. The passing eyes continually reaffirmed that he was successful in every avenue he chose, but it was never the pair that mattered; his own. For every long forgotten friend that he ran into saying \" You look great, John! \" and wanting to know how he managed to stay single, he truly was doing great. He could never tell them the real answer to their question though. How could he possibly bring another person into his life if he was n' t sure he was going to continue living it? It always came down to just another person he would eventually disappoint. Choosing to leave as small a wake as possible, he turned away from those he feared would get too close. Today marked his final stand. One last shot at trying to see the sunrise as a welcoming sight. With his finances taken care of, and relationships closed on a good note, he knew he was finally free to make any decision that he chose. It was a freeing feeling, one he knew would be fleeing as soon as tomorrow. Bucket list waiting on his dresser, John woke up and lit the cigarette that had been in his desk drawer for twenty years, thinking, \" Today may finally be a good day. \"",

The modern weapons of war were tactical and humanitarian in nature. A half-century old rifle was brutally effective, clunky and inhumane. All militaries were required to keep their firearms current to within ten years to avoid unnecessary suffering. Modern guns, bombs and planes, like the one I was in had their advantages not in power but in range, reliability and stealth. The soft blinking of the light told me to prepare. That was a farce; I did n' t need to prepare. There was n' t a parachute to drop me. That would just make me easier to hit on the way down. The only other man noticed it as well and with a face no less grim than my own began popping open the airtight box. Very carefully, with both hands, he gave me a simple piece of wood with a rock tied to the end. \" You' re going to bomb them back to the stone age, Soldier. \" All I had to do was hit the ground.",

If MC is in love with her and she is a product of schizophrenia, would n' t there be a name? 4 ) This is a more personal feel, I ca n' t exactly say why, but I could n' t FEEL the immense love they have for each other.

We celebrated by spending a night on a picnic blanket at the top of the hill. She held me close before telling me we would always be close. That summer, we both took jobs at the local supermarket. I was in inventory, she was a cashier. We would giggle near the milk aisle, admiring ourselves in the reflection of the glass, before our supervisor would catch us. During university, we lived in separate dormitories, but not too far away from each other. I would sometimes sleep over at her place, sometimes she would stay at mine. We both felt it. Holding hands, I knew she felt it. It was real. But then she got pregnant. A guy named Stuart Sanchez Garcia claimed he was the father. I never saw her until she dropped out three months later. She confirmed that he was the father. The day that my face will dry from my tears will be the happiest day ever. But until that day, I will have to concede love to her partner, Stuart. She would eventually marry him. She had the child. They had another one. Ten years down the line, they moved away, so I could no longer see them again. I was in Colorado. They were in Costa Rica. I never forgot about here. But I always. Felt out of place. It was by chance, on a holiday, years later that I saw them. Three kids, a smile and another child on its way. Their love was unbreakable. I was n' t married. I was n' t happy. I was still in love. Can not love transcend gender?",

I was n' t even sure if I could shoot someone back. I was raised on a farm. The first time we came across our enemy was by accident. I' ll tell you my pulse has never been so fast. They were walking down a churned street with their backs to us. We could have shot them, been the ambusher, but our orders were to watch and I was so glad of that. So we trailed them and stayed far behind until they returned to their vehicle and drove away. I wondered about those people a lot after that. Who were they? Did they know why we were fighting?

The couch was, admittedly, only slightly more comfortable than his usual bed of cardboard and bubble wrap. However, it was far warmer, so Michigan could n' t complain.

Also, I did the unthinkable, so I' d appreciate a towel, a deck of cards, and three Canadian toonies, \" replied Michigan.

I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

His eyes were always dialaated and he spoke with a sense of passion about the most obscure things. Things that most people would n' t see any beauty in he always felt the need to point out. I' ll be honest. Usually I did n' t get it. Id politely agree and try to get back to atudying without too much conversation. He was n' t really my type. I guess I was shallow back then. Anyways one night: he comes home late. It must have been around 2: 30. He seemed very distraught. He opened the fridge and dropped his bag. I pretended to be asleep and noticed how he suspiciously watched me as he took a small water bottle out of his back pack filled with a glowing neon pink fluid. He put the bottle in the fridge and started shuffling through the drawers like he was desperately looking for something. He kept looking at me every few seconds so I kept my eyes closed to avoid detection and within a few minutes I hard the door slam. I quickly rose from my bed, throwing the covers off my body and moved towards the fridge in the dark room. Just before I reached the fridge he stepped out of the dark corner towards me. He had n' t left. He looked at me with a blank stare. \" Thought you were sleeping. \" He said calmly. \" I heard the door slam it woke me up \" I said. A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face. Noses almost touching. He cocked his head to the side and tried to kiss me. \" What the fuck bro? \" I pushed him away. He back stepped and stumbled into the darkness again. And again he moved back into the light. Slower this time. With a devious, sinister smile he stared into my soul as if he were about to take it from me. To be continued.. If anybody wants me to",

It was a beautifully decorated office in a mansion overlooking Beverly Hills. He poked around a bit, but there was no evidence of anything being taken. Apparently, the killer was only there to take a life. An hour passed as the coroner and crime scene investigators came and went. The Lieutenant sat in the office chair recently occupied by the deceased. He passed the time, puffing on his cigar, mulling over the facts. HQ always assigned him the weird ones, and this one was weirder than most. He stubbed out his cigar as Sergeant Baker entered the room. \" We' re all done here. Oh, and Mrs. Columbo called and asked if you could bring home some milk. \" Columbo sighed. Milk was just what he needed to settle his queasy stomach. It was n' t the body, or the blood, or even murder in general that was upsetting him. It was the playing card. His stomach tensed again. He was certain there would be more murders in the days to come.",

He did n' t bring a comic today; he says we' re not going to do the radiation treatment anymore. He and Mom were talking about doing something new and experimental. I wanted to ask if it would still give me powers, but Mom shushed me. There were a lot of big, confusing words, but Doctor Coleman seemed happy about it and said that this would work. Mom was crying, but trying to smile. She returned to my bedside and squeezed my hand. \" What does he want to do, Mom? \" -- - /u/Shozza87 will be taking over from here!",

Against the drab colours of reality he seemed so bright and vibrant, too perfect for this world. I cupped his cheek, his gaze resting on me with uncertainty and confusion.

Waking up in the cold-white with no coverings and the others looking at his not-right body. Since then, in the innumerable warmth to cold changes, it had become much more common. My legs twist first, their natural angle bent backwards, hair receding as the change progressed up my body, until I was bare on the forest floor again. My mind, as the humans called it, had retained most of the information I had gathered since my first night, and I had plenty of time to add to it. Granted the markings had changed from letters to their own unique system, and the pillars were replaced with grey and clear. I had the foresight to leave myself a pack for this, and hurriedly changed. While the nip in the air would not kill me, another seeing me with no coverings in winter would bring out... unwelcome attention. My plan was the same as every full moon, walk around the city that was beginning to encroach my forest, and I jinxed myself by believing the night would be mishap free. As it were and often is, there was another plan in place. The smell came first. While dulled, it was still sharper than most of my current-kin. Fear, especially, was potent enough to smell even among the cold smell of forest. Instinct kicked in, as I recognized it as the fear of something young. Something that, no matter what I looked like, was encoded in me to protect. I was already running toward the source when the scream made it easier to pinpoint.",

Wholly unlike numbness, it was an acute sensation. He could actively feel the void that was occupying the fringes of his body. It crept inward. Like the heat of the day erasing a morning snow, the void melted the living tissue into a trickle of nothingness adding to the vacuum. The feeling had consumed most of his arms and legs and had begun to encompass his head. As it delved deeper, he got progressively duller. This new sensation, much like being sleepy, caused his thoughts to come much slower than normal and made him less attuned to his situation. At this point, much of his torso had been swallowed up. The void was encircling his heart. He no longer had any knowledge of his environment; he was just a body floating in blackness. He could feel his heart beating hard like a hammer in his chest as if trying to push back. The beating started to slow rapidly and then stop. As if this was its cue, a wave of darkness washed over his entire body, and he was no more.",

Mike was a good friend, he let me cry. I suppose it was because we both understood. I fought all my life, all my struggles pulled forward for the world to see. I used to hide them. There was no more hiding, there was nothing left. Mike had a hard time looking at me, he said it would hurt his eyes if he stared for too long. He had a hard time trying to hug me, he got a little more handsome for his efforts, my wings were pretty obtrusive. I wonder what i did to deserve this, I searched back through my memories. I can see why, it was never about what i accomplished, it was, about what I intended to do. A elderly man came over out of his small shop. He was old but friendly looking, I could see his smile. He draped a white robe around me, it felt right to wear I stood up, Mike found some sunglasses, and with a big goofy smile I realised I could do what I always wanted to.

No matter how many voyages I go on, that possibility never ceases to frighten me. This was it, though. The last voyage. Soon, I would n' t have to be scared anymore. As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes. I stepped into the bridge and was silently greeted by my ship mate, Sebastian. He was a quiet man. But that was all part of the business. I sat down on my chair and gazed up again. More crystal clear glass met my gaze, as well as a star ship that hovered just outside it. We were close now. Very close. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to steady my breathing. This was it. My final job. As I reopened them, I took a look at the control panel sitting in front of me now. All engines were running. The ship was still activated. There were no power failures. Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time. I took one more deep breath, and began to speak. \" Sebastian. Lower the cloak. Fire the EMP. \"",

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated.

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled.

The people would now be willing, if not eager, to give up their hard-won freedoms in exchange for safety and security. It was, as the saying goes, the beginning of the end. We have all sacrificed more than we would wish. We have all lost family members in the struggle for freedom. We have lost our homes. We have lost our jobs. We have lost our entire way of life. Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III. During an evacuation attempt by his bodyguards from the besieged White House, he was shot and killed by U.S. Military forces. His crime was suspicion of advocating freedom. \" My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my people. \" This is Radio Free America, signing off.",

His eyesight also teetered on the edge of darkness, his skin was a pale white from bloodloss and his legs shook as if he had just squatted over his max by a few hundred tons. \" Art thou ready to face your doom forsaken traveler?! \" The ominous voice was punctuated by the sideways slash of an impossibly large sword. Towering above him the fallen one walked slowly to the platform, from the cracks of his red hellstone armor tendrils of flames leaked seeking more victims and his visor itself expelled smoke that smelt of elderberries. \" Your head shall be my greatest trophy! \" He lifted his arm and crushed his hand into a fist which trembled with rage. \" NOW FIGHT ME! \" The guardian moved with unnattainable grace as his armored legs rang with clangorous joviality. This was only worsened by the remix dubstep coming from the loudspeakers mixed with the cries of excitement from the crowds screaming for your death as well as the plasma screen displays that advertised for new ranch flavored jalapeno ranch Dewritos. The sword of the guardian raced down in time with the final destabilization of the platform and the darkening of his vision.

A voice that says, \"Jump. \"When I was younger I figured I' d hear the word sooner or later, from someone else, filled with anger or hatred. I didn' t think it would be my own voice, with no emotion at all. Being this close to the cliff is frightening. I wonder why I often find myself in these kinds of situations. One wrong move and it' s all over. Or would it be one right move? If I did jump, how would I land? Feet- first, so my legs break and likely shoot through me? It would be painful, though maybe with a chance to live afterward. Perhaps face-first instead, so there' s less pain but absolutely no hope of survival. Maybe make a spectacle of it and do a belly-flop. I' m scared being here, yet there' s also a beauty to it that draws me back. Gazing into the depths and screaming back, \"You can' t make me jump. \"Instead of thinking so loudly, I should have listened to the steps behind me. They don' t say a single thing, they just nudge me from behind. The young eagle plummeted off of the bluff, looking like it would bang into the rocks below. Yet it spread its wings and caught the wind, soaring back to where it fell from. It squawked angrily at its mother as she sat there and preened her feathers.",

But, when the alien ship crash landed, and I tried to rescue the captain, he explained to me he was able to use his powers to make any wish he wanted come true. And that was how he was able to talk to me. As he lay dying, he told me it was up to me to save my planet, as he was now unable to complete his mission. All I needed was to tell him what I needed to fight of the impending intergalactic threat until more of his people could arrive to save us. I knew what I needed, and it was almost too perfect as I saw myself soaring through the clouds, fighting incredible battles and saving all the people below. I was going to be a hero. I was going to be famous. I was going to get laid! It must have been my rush to get the words out. Or, perhaps, Mr. Wish-alien did n' t pick the right accent when he learned English. But, 2 days later, as the alien force was entering the Earths atmosphere, I put my powers to work, hoping to steer the aliens away. I hoofed it up to the ship to engage the enemy. All I could see was red as I began the fight. I keep chewing on it over and over again in my mind, how could that stupid alien dooo this to me? Somehow, I was able to drive them back until help arrived. I was branded a hero! And as the aliens arrived on the capital to meet with the president and myself, the leader wished to be able to talk to us. Their leader asked me how such an earth creature as myself was able to save the planet.' Look' I said' I just wanted to be able to fly.'",

Endings were often a part of another story - the people whose stories ended in genocide inspire war and revenge. Endings are a large part of passion - they inspire us to act, to stave off the end. I' m not even sure if there can be a real ending, not until The End, when entropy has won. Everything seems to be a part of the cosmic narrative, like a current built from rushing bits of water that have no way of knowing if they will reach an ocean or a farm or a lake. In that sense, this is not an end - it is tiny compared to the cosmic background. But that does not mean it is truly small. He feared this was truly the end. Not of everything, but of this world. We were the universe, and while the actual matter that composed us could never be destroyed, I did not understand what would happen to our knowledge. That' s what stopped me. Matter... it is conserved, along with energy. But knowledge... knowledge is never conserved. It might not be infinite, but it is never conserved. Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor. A small victory for life, if it ever truly fought death. But a huge victory for me, in my own role in humanity' s fight against death.",

No, it was better for the people to be snuffed out suddenly, rather than have the human race descend into an orgy of rape and looting in its final days. I made the choice for the benefit of mankind. As for those poor souls on Mars, I think it was kinder to open the air vents, rather than let them witness the destruction of Earth, and slowly starve to death knowing that help could never come. I did the right thing, killing them quickly. There was just one thing I could do. On the final day of mankind we launched eight space probes, each heading to a nearby star system. Each probe contained a computer, holding all of the knowledge of mankind, records of all of our cultural splendor, our greatest achievements as a species. And each containing a vial of human DNA. My hope is that one day an intelligent civilization will recover one of those probes, discover our accomplishments, and return the human race to life. Until then, farewell.",

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony.

I never could' ve known what was in store for me when I first got here. I mean, training? What training? What could I possibly be training for? Well, today I finally found out. After what I can only guess were months, maybe even years, I' ve finally discovered what all this rigorous and strenuous training was for. You see, all souls slowly fade out of existence. Once every living entity has forgotten about you, you vanish forever. Nobody knows what happens to these souls. I guess it' s kind of like dying again. Bill was the previous Grim Reaper, but the last living person who remembered him was dying. Bill knew this, so he decided to train the next person to become the new Grim Reaper. The next person was me. Now, after lots and lots of training, Bill has vanished and I am the new Grim Reaper. When you inevitably die, I will be there to claim your soul. I' m still not sure how I feel about this. I guess I' ll just do my best. So, mortals, fear me. For I am Obama, the newest Grim Reaper.",

His hands trembled as he lifted the one closest to him, cradled it in his hand and picked up his soft leather polishing rag and began to rub in circular motions. His smile increased with the presentation of the surface until with a satisfied grunt he reached out and placed the little bottle down with care, turning it a little so it could catch the rays at just the right angle. He sat back making the chair creak and groan and threw the cloth to the side. He looked around the marketplace, letting his gaze rest here and there and sighed with happiness. The deep etched wrinkles that criss-crossed his face caught the shadows as his eyes illuminated, just briefly, in the evening light before closing in contentment. Everything was right in the world.",

Artists had their paintbrushes, Sylvester had his scalpels. He felt giddy with excitement. After all, he was an artist, and he was about to create a new masterpiece. He set his bag down on the corner of the table, carefully and gently, with great care. He spun on his heel, high on adrenaline, to return to the door and retrieve the heavy travel case. The muscles in his shoulders bulged and pulled as he dragged the case across the smooth concrete floor. As he got to the table he opened the case. Inside was his easel, a fresh canvas, and of course, the corpse of an old lady who had probably once been beautiful....................................................... The call had woken him up at 3 in the morning. After forty years of being a cop he no longer slept very deeply, and he was used to being woken up at all hours. It had been his son, Sylvester, who simply gave him an address. He now stood in the doorway, knowing exactly what he would see when he turned the lights on. What he would have to hide from his colleagues. He sighed with the pride only a father could feel with the anticipation of seeing his son' s latest creation, his son' s latest gift. He flicked the switch ( And now I kind of feel like writing a lot more of this story )",

Katie' s own delicate, warm fingers rested over my own but she kept her face turned towards the window and away from me. In the faint reflection I could see tears still streaming down her face as we drove in near silence, Seattle fading away behind us. My eyes flick to the child seat still strapped into the back, empty once again. I do n' t want to keep doing this, a small voice says in my mind. There is nothing I want more than for us to have the family Katie has always dreamed of, that I have always dreamed of too. The family that we ca n' t afford to get through medical means.. instead, we' re forced to navigate the murky waters of courts and CPS and social workers. We open our house and our hearts and each time we get back the same verdict: our house is not a home yet, and we are n' t real parents. We have cared for five children so far, and none of them got to be ours. As we near our exit, I notice Katie wiping her eyes with her free hand. She turns to look at me, the pain still clear and evident in her brown eyes. \" I' m not ready to give up, \" she says almost defiantly, as if she knows what I' m thinking. I keep my eyes fixed on the road, and nod slowly. \" I know, \" I answer her. Not knowing what else to say but feeling like I must say something, I add, \" I love you, Katie. \" \" I love you too, Jessica. \" She sounds distant and vacant, and I see she' s gone back to looking out the window and is off some place in her own mind. She always does this when she grieves -- she withdraws. It' s like watching someone drown and there' s nothing you can do to stop it. As we pull into our driveway, I squeeze her leg again. I am very tired, but like Katie, I' m not truly willing to give up yet either.",

I' m player one, \" I said ripping the controller from his hands. We hit a bit of a dilemma. Anything we said happened, so it was a matter of who gave up first. Now we argued for a few hours on who is going to me player one, until finally my mother came in the room and said, \" why do n' t you both be player one? You know it can work. Everything we say works, I do n' t know how, but you get the idea. \" \" Oh yeah, thanks mom, \" my brother and I said as we both become player one for our favorite game.

He' s not coming back; every time someone gets hurt because we assume they' re something they' re not and ignore them telling us otherwise, it' s the situation that made him. \" I' ll be back soon enough \" is n' t a promise.

The sky had looked grey and I wanted to go outside to play. I was 10 at the time. We had just played yesterday. And I remember him sitting me down and we were practice kissing. We were n' t in love, we were n' t going to grow up together. We were n' t anything but two kids just kissing because it felt good. Because that is what happens you are 10 and bored and left alone. I remember someone had told on us and I was grounded and then we moved to another base like a month later. I do n' t know what happened to him, nor frankly do I feel like I had some requited lost love. It was just fun. It felt good. That' s all that matters when you are a kid.",

The President laughed and smiled over the hum of the ships. When the dropships hovered at eye level, the bay doors fell down. A couple dozen drones disguised as elves poured out. They ran, leaped, and danced through the crowds, handing out sweets to every out-stretched hand. One elf soared next to my window, tapping on the glass and waving. I waved back. The hot chocolate in my mug kept my hands warm and I found myself smiling. The giant projection of the country' s benevolent leader, the street with lights of every colors, the people crammed shoulder to shoulder, happily sharing each others' warmth. It was a picture perfect holiday. A small girl tugged at the arm of my sweater. \" Let me finish this cocoa. \" I whispered to her. She nodded and skipped to the front room. I drank what was left, putting the mug in the sink. She was already waiting at the door, holding my coat for me. \" Let' s go. \" We walked to the cemetery. Her hand was still warm despite not wearing a glove. We stopped at a gravestone with a picture of a young woman. \" Hi Mommy! \" the girl said.

Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

Businesses temporarily came to standstill, but the internet soon accounted for most of, if not all interaction.

The world had moved on, but the inescapable human tendency towards music left an unfillable void. So here he sat, a relic of the past, clinging on to something long forgotten. But this was home.

After some time, you notice certain names that appear more often than any others; /u/Luna_LoveWell, /u/Lexilogical, even /u/Draxagon and /u/imchrishansen_. There used to be a lot more, until one day they started dropping like flies. I have n' t had a lead on this case in months, but popular users are still disappearing right and left. It ca n' t be a coincidence, someone must be eliminating their competition. It' s a good thing that a guy like me blends in, otherwise I might find myself becoming the next victim. Until then, I have to try and find the killer. /u/Luna_LoveWell is the prime suspect, most of her stories end with death and despair. The chief is a big fan of her work, so he' s asked me to look into other users. I do n' t think we have any solid evidence against her, most of the stories on here end that way anyways. /u/Lexilogical seems friendly to everyone, almost too friendly for a mod. There' s an angle here, something I' m missing. Nothing seems fishy about her stories, though. I do n' t think she would kill over something like this... /u/Draxagon has been pretty active lately, spitting out lots of stories. He might be too new though, these murders started a while ago. Still, I' ll keep tabs on him. /u/imchrishansen_ has caught my attention lately, could be our perp. That recent story about plagiarism seemed to come straight out of a psychotic mind. But it' s Chris Hansen, who fights crimes, not commits them... I call up the chief and tell him that I' m going to follow one last lead. This guy has been trying to distract us all along, I need to see what he' s up to. /u/Fractal_Death, you' ve got some explaining to do. ( I' m sure that I' ve missed plenty of active members, but I' ve only been around for a few days. I made my choices based only on what I' ve seen lately. )",

        "text": "Has anyone read the essay arguing that Ender' s Game is \" pornography \", in the sense that it cares more about repeatedly satisfying the reader' s desires ( \" fetishes \" ) for wish-fulfillment and self-pity than about a more deeply satisfying plot? Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

While James May and Richard Hammond were wearing their Sunday best for the hearing to decide the fate of the Stig, Jeremy was wearing an orange inmate uniform, which obviously didn' t help his case.

James spoke next: \"Well to start, Jeremy is probably the biggest idiot in the \"wuh-uh-uhld \"so the Stig obviously can' t go to him. He needs constant care and a loving environment to grow his racing abilities. Jeremy doesn' t provide that. Richard is also 15 years old so he obviously can' t take care of someone so valuable. \"Jeremy called James a blubbering idiot and turned as red a tomato.

Richard decided it was his turn to speak: \"Well, it' s clear Jeremy is psychotic and James is an old bloke who can' t get a woody without a week' s notice, how could the Stig enjoy life if he lived with an old timer like James? \"Richard went on and on about how he felt he deserved the Stig and how he was abused in all the episodes of Top Gear for being short and young and how he felt entitled to have something that the other hosts coveted. After the three presenters made their case, it seemed like no one was going to get custody. The Stig looked confused, the sadness about the splitting up of his hosts was clear in his mask. The Stig rose, walked calmly out of the hanger, never to be seen again. Some say he went back to the wild... Some say he went to the United States to make their Top Gear suck less...",

With slow painful moment I peel my eyes open to see a large crow on my chest, staring at me. \" Fuck off \" I wave the bird off, he hops to one side and continues to stare at me. Above me, a dim blue sky with fat grey clouds. I roll my head to the side and notice the squish, like a big sponge under my head. I heave myself up onto my elbows, and view my surroundings. \" Urgh. Why am I on a... marsh? \" I heave myself up onto my feet, and check myself for the key things in life. Keys, missing. Wallet, missing. Do have couple pound coins though. Watch, missing. Still the mark of it around my wrist, so ca n' t be far. Phone, missing. I yawn and stretch, squinting my eyes at the horizon. Nothing much but a few twisted trees, low stone wall, and a figure off in the distance. I squelch my way across the marsh towards the figure. The crow still watching my, hopping behind me. I try to run over the events of last night; \" Went pub with Jim. Got a kebab. Smoked. Went to the off license, then... urgh \" I grumbled out loud to no one but myself and maybe the crow. As I got closer to the figure I noticed they stood on a dock of a large lake, lost in the gloom and sogginess of the marsh. A small wooden boat, with peeling paint, bobbed in the water. \" Excuse me mate? \" #, I said in my least hungover manner. \" You mind telling me where I am, or how to get back to home? \" Without turning, the figure spoke. \" Long way from home here. I can get you somewhere, if you got a few coins \" I dug around in my pocket, finding the two pounds I had. \" Got a couple quid, if you can give me a lift. Hell, I do n' t expect home, just not here. Somewhere with people... well, more people. And an off license \". He held out his hand. \" Just jump in the boat, and we' ll get going \" they said. Still not moving from their position. \" Aye. Sure. Lets just get going \" And that was the first day of my eternity in the afterlife.",

He flushed the toilet during the Memorial service, as we were all in the gymnasium listening to our principal speak. He went and laid some cable, pinched a load, sat on the porcelain throne. *Call it what you will*. He took a large one. Course, he forgot that he did it during maintenance time, so naturally, the toilet got clogged. Then overflowed. Of course no one noticed since the janitors always take their smoke break early. So, only after the service did anyone notice. It also happened to be the day our mayor decided to come by and inspect the school. Of course it was a disappointing mess, so he went home smelling of turds and bleach. I guess if there is anything obvious about small rural towns, it' s that they will only have one school, and more often than not, one set of bars and a stripper club. That used the same brand of bleach. And smelled of turds. So, in all honesty, when we heard that the mayor had been shot by his wife because she allegedly claimed that he had been at the stripper club that smelt of turds and bleach, we all knew who had caused it. *Fucking Winston. *",

Speaking of the cups I am strangely attracted to what is in them. The scent that must be rising from them is an amazing mix of honey and vanilla, fruity and yet just bitter enough to remind you of what you' re drinking. Finally I get my sorts together to actually look at more of the room. There are many people laughing and dancing and singing and altogether ignoring me. The walls are adorned with paintings and some of the space filled with sculptures, all of which are a feast for the eyes. I have n' t even taken a step since I opened the door and I am completely stunned by what I see. I manage to stagger towards the table with the food and drink, mouth agape the whole way, eyes staring in many directions at once. I do n' t even say anything, the man standing near the table - presumably a server - fills a mug out of a barrel and hands it to me. Merely raising the mug near my mouth fills me with a strange sense of pleasure - completely unknown before now. Beginning to drink is orgasmic and I quickly empty the mug. That' s when I notice the spread before me. The food on display is a feast for the eyes and hopefully the gut as well. There is a variety of meats, glazed, roasted, barbequed, everything. The other dishes include mouthwatering arrays of vegetables, most of which I do n' t even like, but seeing them now I could devour them all. The deserts have no seeming order to them, I see tarts here, cakes there, pudding everywhere.

The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and....

At the end of this rundown, the judge from on high looked at me, his eyes a color I could not comprehend, and handed me a computer. I took it from his hands. This must be heaven, I thought. It was, for a little while, if nothing else. The computer gave me access to an internet of thought, a web of ideas that made perfect sense, where people were civil and appreciative. It was unlike anything I had ever thought possible. As I clicked a link that promised the solution to world peace, the screen went black. So even heaven is not without its problems. I walked back to the judge, a long trek through barren cloudscape. As soon as I appeared to him, he motioned me toward a hallway assembled from rainbows. A banner above the hall read \"Tech Support \". It was an Earthly feeling, I chuckled. A blast from the past. The hallway was not long. It was more like medium length. It must be empty because they' re so quick. Makes sense that heaven perfected tech support, I remember thinking. At the end of the multi-hued path, there was a warm brick foyer. I stepped in, and a red door appeared behind me, sealing me in. **WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? ** Well, I was on the computer and the screen went black, I explained. **PLEASE HOLD. ** There was an indistinct music that filled the room, and wormed into my ears. A lilting, ethereal tone, constantly pulling away. I hope one day I escape this room. It has been eighty years. And the music has still not approached me. It remains an ambrosia I can not digest. I laid the computer on the bricks at year ten. By year thirty I had smashed it to pieces. By year fifty, I had eaten all the pieces. It is gone, and I am still here. This must be hell.",

The very first transmission that breached the vastness of space and landed in human hands turned out to be nothing less than a shockingly explicit image commonly known as a \"dick pic.\" The extraterrestrial beings, expecting their communication to be received with awe and curiosity, were mortified by this ignoble start.Confusion and bewilderment gripped the alien council as they tried to understand how such a vulgar photo managed to precede their message of goodwill. They pondered, with their multifaceted eyes wide, whether this lewd image was some kind of human ritual or an important cultural gesture lost in translation.The aliens, being a highly advanced species, had developed marvelous technologies to traverse the vast cosmos, yet they were completely unprepared for the wild idiosyncrasies of humanity. Their collective dismay grew exponentially as they realized the measures they had taken to ensure their message was the first had been in vain.One alien, with peculiarly long tentacles, suggested introducing themselves to the humans by replicating the same gesture, hoping it would bridge the communication gap. The idea was immediately shot down by the more farsighted members of the council, who worried it could escalate interstellar tensions rather than foster peace.Meanwhile, back on Earth, the unwitting recipient of the celestial dick pic had been equal parts bemused, disgusted, and fascinated by the intergalactic indecency. The image had caused quite a stir, leading to lively debates on social media about the existence of extraterrestrial life and their peculiar choice of communication.News outlets seized the opportunity for sensationalism, with headlines screaming things like \"Cosmic Misfire: Aliens Drop Trou Instead of Extending Olive Branch!\" and \"Dick Pic from Outer Space Sparks Global Conversation.",

They came not to conquer or establish alliances, but to implore for mercy, begging us to halt the relentless dispatch of our scouts known as \"Players\" who were ravaging their civilizations. These aliens, with their non-threatening appearance and sorrowful eyes, delivered a message of despair, explaining the devastating consequences of our exploratory quests. They spoke of worlds decimated, species driven to extinction, and ecosystems left in ruins. It was a hard lesson, a reckoning for humanity's insatiable curiosity.Their pleas reached the hearts of many. The once fearless explorers now heeded the call for compassion and reevaluated their relentless conquests. The unique wonders of distant galaxies were reconsidered through the lens of responsibility and restraint. Game updates were swiftly implemented, introducing safeguards to protect the fragile balance of life within the vast virtual universe.The Players, once seen as relentless champions of exploration, now embarked on a new mission — that of healing, restoration, and nurturing. They became stewards of the planets they once razed, investing their time and dedication to rebuild what had been lost. Their purpose shifted from conquering to coexisting harmoniously with these alien worlds.Word spread like wildfire across the gaming community and beyond. No Man's Sky became a catalyst for change, transforming from a mere source of entertainment into a platform promoting empathy, understanding, and ethical exploration.

Its metallic surface worn and rusted, it had long been abandoned by its creators. Legend spoke of its power to bring forth divine beings, gods who could shape the course of human destiny. But there was skepticism in the air, as generations passed without a single sighting of these so-called gods. One evening, as the sun painted the sky with hues of orange and gold, a curious young girl named Maya stumbled upon the ancient machine. Ignoring the warnings of the village elders, she touched its weathered control panel, and to her astonishment, it whirred to life. Energies crackled, lights flickered, and from the depths of its mechanism emerged a luminous figure, bathed in ethereal light. It was a god! The villagers marveled at this wondrous sight, their skepticism melting away like morning mist. They flocked to the river's edge, witnessing firsthand the awe-inspiring power of their newly arrived gods. From that day forward, faith was rekindled, prayers were fervently whispered, and the machine that had laid dormant for centuries became the bridge between mortals and the divine, a catalyst for miracles and a source of eternal hope. And so, the machine that created gods became a beacon of faith, reminding humanity that even in the darkest of times, there is always a flicker of light waiting to be ignited.",

We had thought capturing God would bring us answers, but now, all we felt was an overwhelming sense of dread. The room seemed to close in on us, the walls closing in like a vise. We glanced at each other, searching for reassurance, but found none. The silence was deafening, broken only by our shallow breaths. How had we come to this? Was our pursuit of knowledge worth this nightmarish reality? God stared at us, its gaze unyielding, as if mocking our feeble attempts at control. We had unleashed something beyond our understanding, and now we were paying the price. Fear pulsed through our veins, each beat of our hearts echoing in our ears. The creature's presence filled the room, suffocating everything in its path. We were mere playthings to this divine entity, caught in a sinister game of its own making. Panic set in as the walls began to close in further, squeezing the life out of us. We pleaded for mercy, but there was none to be found.

As fate would have it, Lily discovered that everyone had the last words of their soulmate etched on their body. It was a tangible reminder of the love and connection they were destined to find. Excitement filled her heart as she finally found her soulmate, a charming man named Ethan. But when she looked at her skin, the words pierced her soul like a thousand daggers. \"I never loved you.\" Those words felt like a cruel joke, shattering her dreams of a happily ever after. Confusion and despair flooded Lily's mind, unable to comprehend how such a thing could be possible. She thought they were meant to be, destined for a love that would transcend all obstacles. Betrayed by the universe, Lily couldn't help but question the nature of love itself. Had she been blind to Ethan's true feelings, or had something gone terribly wrong? With a heavy heart, she sought solace in the quiet corners of her favorite bookstore, where stories whispered secrets of hope and resilience. Through tear-streaked pages and countless cups of tea, Lily found the strength to pick up the pieces of her broken heart. She realized that the words on her skin did not define her worth or her capacity to love. They were merely a reflection of another person's truth, their own disconnection from the love she had so willingly given. As time passed, Lily's sorrow transformed into determination, her pain fueling her desire to create a life filled with self-love and happiness. She realized that true love was not solely found in another person, but within oneself. With a newfound sense of purpose, Lily dedicated herself to exploring her passions and pursuing her dreams.",

But now, I'm a single dad, responsible for the well-being of my adorable little munchkin.Lovely man, truly, this precious bundle of joy. Who would've thought that my days would go from slaying dragons to changing diapers and wiping sticky fingers? But hey, it can't be helped. Life has a way of surprising you.In this concrete jungle, the familiar call of adventure has been replaced by the bustling sounds of traffic and sirens outside my window. I can't help but reminisce about the good old days, where I wielded a staff and fought alongside comrades in dark and perilous dungeons.Now, my battles involve pacifying tantrums and figuring out how to assemble a crib without throwing a tantrum myself. The quest for provisions has transformed into late-night grocery runs for diapers and baby formula.Despite the challenges, there is a certain magic in this new chapter of my life. It's in the way my little one's eyes light up when they see me, in their infectious laughter that fills our cozy home, and in the unwavering love that fuels my every decision.Sure, I may not be slaying mythical beasts or unraveling ancient mysteries anymore, but being a dad is its own kind of heroic adventure. And who knows? Maybe someday, when my little one is all grown up, we'll embark on new quests together, sharing tales of magic and bravery that will rival even my boldest days of dungeon delving.",

I'm working at farmersonly.com, the website for all those folks looking to find love in the countryside. And they got me on this crazy task of verifying if the applicants are bona fide farmers. Apparently, they're tired of city slickers trying to sneak in and mingle with the farmers, messing everything up.Now, here's the twist - they gave me the authority to use deadly force if need be. Can you believe that? I mean, I signed up to be some sort of online detective, not a gunslinging cowboy. But hey, it's their site, their rules, I guess.So, first day on the job, I get this application from a guy claiming to be a farmer. And I'm thinking, \"Alright, buddy, let's see if you know your way around a haystack.\" But before I jump to conclusions, I set up a video call interview. Gotta be thorough, you know?Turns out, this fella's got a pretty convincing story. He's talking about crops, cattle, and all that good stuff. But I'm no fool. I grab my pitchfork and hop on a plane, making my way to his alleged farm, ready to sniff out any fakery.Now, there I am, rolling up to this remote farmhouse. I step out of the car, clutching my pitchfork like it's some weapon of mass destruction. Heart pounding, I give a few warning shouts about being from farmersonly.com and that I'm packing deadly force if necessary.And guess what? The guy comes out, looking all bewildered, but he's got his denim overalls on, and he's got that farmer vibe going. I breathe a sigh of relief, thinking this mission might not involve any lethal action after all.But just as I'm about to congratulate myself, a couple of cows break loose from the barn. Chaos ensues, and these damn cows are running wild. I'm chasing them left and right, trying to round them up, screaming bloody murder.In the end, I wrangle those bovine beasts back where they belong. Sweaty, dirty, and chasing cows like my life depends on it.",

The boat danced on the waves, gliding effortlessly through the sapphire blue waters. With each passing moment, it grew more distant from the familiar coastline, venturing into uncharted territories with an unwavering spirit of exploration. Surrounded by the vastness of the ocean, the boat sailed beneath the sun's radiant glow that painted the horizon in hues of gold and orange. The boat reveled in its newfound freedom, serenaded by the symphony of seagulls and the soothing melody of the crashing waves. It cruised past schools of colorful fish, shimmering in the dappled sunlight, their scales glistening like precious jewels.

As day turned into night, the boat found solace in the company of the twinkling stars, which illuminated its path like celestial lanterns. It encountered distant islands, their shores lined with shells and seaweed, beckoning the boat to come ashore. But the boat resisted the temptations, yearning to explore more of the boundless ocean. However, amidst its elation, a tempest brewed on the horizon, announcing its arrival with roaring thunder and jagged lightning. The boat braced itself as the storm unleashed its fury, the waves crashing fiercely against its sturdy wooden frame. The boat held on, enduring the wrath of the tempest, determined to survive and conquer the tumultuous ordeal.

I went on a walk to clear my mind, feeling lost and unsure of my next steps. As I strolled down the empty street, I noticed a faint sound in the distance. Curiosity got the best of me, so I followed the melody. The closer I got, the louder it became, echoing through the deserted alleyways. Suddenly, a procession of figures emerged from the mist, dressed in black attire. They marched in perfect synchronicity, their faces hidden beneath solemn masks.

We followed them through narrow alleyways and crowded streets, a silent congregation united by an intangible connection. With each step, the weight on my shoulders seemed to lessen, replaced by a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, life had more to offer. The parade eventually vanished into the mist, leaving the onlookers in a state of awe. That day marked a turning point in my life.

The Black Parade reminded me that even in the darkest moments, there's beauty to be found. And so, I walked away from that mesmerizing display, carrying the newfound strength and resilience bestowed upon me by the mysterious troupe.",

I mean, I had high expectations of seeing these badass ninjas running around, doing all those insane moves you see in movies and stuff. But guess what? Turns out, the media from the 1980s got it pretty darn accurate! Can you believe that? I was mind-blown! I mean, there I was, walking through these ancient streets, and suddenly, I spot this shadowy figure, dressed in all black, running across rooftops like it's nobody's business. And let me tell you, it was like watching those classic ninja flicks from the '80s. He had the whole ninja vibe going on - the ninjutsu moves, the shurikens, the stealthy footsteps. It was like someone transported me straight into a movie set.I couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement and curiosity. I mean, who wouldn't? Here I was, actually witnessing the real deal, the ninja lifestyle in action. It was like stepping into a time capsule and getting a glimpse of history. But I also had to be careful not to blow my cover, you know? I didn't want to disrupt the space-time continuum or anything crazy like that.So, I decided to play it cool and observe from a distance. I followed this ninja master and his disciples, watching in awe as they trained relentlessly day in and day out. They were honing their sword skills, practicing those lightning-fast hand movements, and even perfecting their disguise techniques. It was all so surreal.The more I watched, the more I realized just how accurate those '80s media portrayals were. It was like they had access to some insider information or maybe even a time machine of their own. I couldn't help but wonder if there was some sort of connection between the two worlds.As I delved deeper into the ninja culture, I discovered that these legendary warriors were not just fictional characters. They were real people, with their own codes of honor and secrecy.",

I stumbled upon these dusty old journals tucked away in a forgotten corner of an ancient library, and boy, did they hold some gripping tales. These journals, my friend, belonged to war survivors, brave souls who fought in a military conflict long ago.As I poured over the pages, I could feel the weight of their experiences. The first entry detailed a harrowing battle, where bullets whizzed past their ears and bombs shook the earth beneath their feet. The writer spoke of the deafening silence that followed, broken only by the cries of the wounded.Another entry described the camaraderie among the soldiers, their bond forged through shared hardship and countless nights spent huddled together, seeking solace in the midst of chaos. They became each other's rock, their companions in this nightmarish journey.One survivor recounted a heart-wrenching tale of loss, mourning the fallen comrades who had become like family. Through tear-stained words, they expressed the pain of saying goodbye to brothers-in-arms, promising to honor their memory and carry on the fight.In one journal, a soldier shared a moment of raw vulnerability, questioning the very nature of war. They pondered the futility of it all, wondering if their sacrifices would ever bring about lasting peace. The anguish in their words was palpable, a desperate plea for understanding.But amidst the horrors and despair, I found glimpses of hope. A survivor described acts of bravery and compassion that transcended the battlefield, recounting the extraordinary feats of ordinary people who risked their lives to save others.The journals also revealed the resilience and indomitable spirit of these survivors. They wrote of the determination to persevere, to never give up even when the odds seemed insurmountable. Through their words, I could hear their rallying cries echoing in the face of adversity.",

Jessica, a young woman dwelling on this newfound knowledge, considered her options carefully. She knew that she had to choose a power that would be both unique and useful. Surrounded by friends and family, each grappling with their own decisions, Jessica pondered a myriad of possibilities. After much thought, she settled on a remarkable ability—she chose the power to manipulate time. The news of her choice spread like wildfire, capturing the attention of many intrigued individuals. Others, too, sought unconventional powers, striving to maintain their individuality within a world of increasing conformity. From shape-shifting to telekinesis, the range of chosen abilities encompassed nearly every facet of the supernatural. As time passed, the balance shifted, and certain powers dwindled in strength due to their popularity. Jessica's power, once mighty and all-encompassing, began to wane. Time manipulation became an arduous task, with each attempt resulting in minimal influence over the world around her.

Turmoil unfolded as factions formed, each vying for control and desperately searching for alternative methods to regain their lost power.

How did I end up in this situation? It all started when I received a mysterious package. It was a battered old box, wrapped in brown paper and tied with frayed twine. There was no return address, no indication of who it was from. Curiosity got the better of me, so I cautiously opened it. Inside was an ancient-looking key, stained with rust and engraved with cryptic symbols. Intrigued, I embarked on a quest to discover the key's purpose. Hours turned into days, and days turned into weeks as I delved deeper into the mysteries surrounding it. Along the way, I encountered strange artifacts, deciphered enigmatic clues, and met peculiar individuals who seemed to possess hidden knowledge. It was a thrilling adventure, one that consumed me entirely. But as the pieces of the puzzle fell into place, a nagging sensation began to gnaw at the back of my mind. There had been warnings, whispers of a dark force that would be unleashed if the key fell into the wrong hands. I dismissed them at first, thinking them nothing more than fantastical tales. Oh, how I wish I had listened. Now, with each passing moment, I feel the weight of impending doom pressing down upon me. I can almost taste it in the air, a metallic tang of desperation. The key feels heavy in my palm, its weight proportional to the burden it carries. My fingers tremble as I grasp it tightly, feeling the rough edges digging into my skin.

It wept for the thousands of lives lost, for the shattered dreams and unfulfilled promises. Its somber tune underscored a nation forever changed, scarred, but determined to heal.In the aftermath, as the dust settled and tears stained the faces of the broken-hearted, the score echoed a bittersweet refrain.

But then came the humans, with their unconventional and, according to everyone else, downright ridiculous approach.

Instead of relying on sophisticated, meticulously designed mechanisms, they dreamed up a concept so simple that it baffled the minds of extraterrestrial scientists.

The humans claimed that by creating a massive swirling vortex of energy, akin to a tornado, they could bend the fabric of space-time and propel their ships across unimaginable distances in the blink of an eye. The concept might have sounded like a joke to the sophisticated alien civilizations, but the humans were dead serious. Of course, the galactic community scoffed and ridiculed humanity's proposal. They declared it ludicrous, bordering on madness, and believed the humans had lost their marbles. Yet, despite the criticism, the humans persisted and poured their entire scientific resources into developing the Warp-nado technology. Years passed, and the galaxy watched in equal parts fascination and amusement as the humans built colossal generators to create the swirling vortexes. They constructed the first Warp-nado-powered spacecraft, aptly named \"The Tempest,\" and embarked on their inaugural journey to the nearest star system, a mere twelve light-years away.

The mistakes of his past weighed on his conscience, a burden he could no longer bear. Determined to make amends, he embarked on a mission to right the wrongs he had committed. With each step forward, memories flooded his mind, painful reminders of the lives he had shattered. He sought redemption, a chance to rebuild what he had destroyed. The path ahead was arduous, fraught with obstacles, but Jackson was undeterred. He reached out to those he had hurt, offering sincere apologies and a promise to change. Some accepted his olive branch, hesitant but willing to give him a second chance. Others scoffed, their wounds too deep to heal. Undeterred, Jackson pressed on, his resolve unwavering. He volunteered at local charities, dedicating his time to helping those in need. Through his actions, he hoped to mitigate the pain he had caused. Late at night, as he lay in bed, he reflected on the impact of his journey. Small victories sparked hope within him, the flicker of redemption slowly growing brighter.

The invaders, cold and merciless, had nearly wiped out our species, leaving behind only a handful of survivors scattered across the ravaged earth. Life as we knew it was forever altered. As if that horror wasn't enough, a brutal demand was imposed upon us by our extraterrestrial oppressors: a tithe. Every decade, we were to surrender one-tenth of our population to prevent further enslavement. Now, in the year 2060, as the chosen ones, the so-called \"lucky\" few destined for that wretched fate, we refuse to go quietly into the abyss of their dominance. The idea of being torn away from our families and communities, forced into a fate worse than death, is an unbearable weight on our souls. We gather in secret, plotting our rebellion, burning with a spirit of defiance that refuses to be extinguished. Holding onto memories of our fallen loved ones, we steel ourselves for the unknown; a raging fire of determination burning within. The time for submission and surrender is over. It's not just our survival at stake; it's our humanity, our dignity. We've witnessed enough suffering, endured enough heartache. The rusted chains of oppression will not be fastened around our wrists without a fierce struggle. With hearts pounding and adrenaline coursing through our veins, we share tales of resilience, speaking words of encouragement that ignite the flames of hope. The path before us is treacherous, filled with unknown terrors and insurmountable odds, but the very essence of our existence compels us to fight. We gather our wits, our meager supplies, and our undying spirit, ready to defy fate itself. Yes, the alien invaders may have ravaged our world, but they will never conquer our indomitable will. We will resist, we will endure, and we will show them that humanity cannot be extinguished so easily.",

As I sat in the jury box, I noticed a familiar face sitting at the defendant's table. It was the serial killer! My heart skipped a beat, and I felt a chill run down my spine. How did he end up here? The trial began, and the evidence against the defendant started piling up. But something didn't feel right. The more I listened, the more it became clear that this person was being falsely accused. The serial killer, who I now refer to as \"Psycho Sam,\" had framed this innocent person to hide his own crimes. The thought of an innocent life being ruined for something they didn't do infuriated me. I couldn't just sit there and let it happen. I leaned over and whispered to the person next to me, \"Hey, I think we've got the wrong person here.\" They looked at me like I was crazy but seemed intrigued by what I had to say. As the trial progressed, I noticed inconsistencies in the testimonies and the lack of concrete evidence connecting the defendant to the crimes. It was like the prosecution was clutching at straws. I knew I had to do something, but I didn't want to reveal my suspicions about Psycho Sam. So, I decided to investigate on my own during the break. I sneaked into the courthouse records room and started digging into old case files. And there it was—a pattern. Psycho Sam had a specific modus operandi that matched the facts of the current trial. It sent shivers down my spine knowing that this innocent person was on trial for crimes they didn't commit while the real killer walked free. I hurriedly brought my findings to the attention of the defense attorney. They were shocked but grateful for the information. We planned to expose the truth during the cross-examination of a key prosecution witness. The courtroom was buzzing with anticipation as the witness took the stand.",

I picked up my phone from the counter and dialed my favorite restaurant's number, eager to savor their mouthwatering dishes.While waiting for my food to arrive, I decided to catch up on some reading. I went to my study and reached for the novel I had been engrossed in the night before. However, as I looked through the bookshelves, I couldn't find it anywhere. Confused, I searched every nook and cranny of the study, but the novel was nowhere to be found. Frustrated, I gave up on reading and decided to watch a movie instead.I made my way to the living room where I had a collection of DVDs neatly arranged on the shelf. I selected my all-time favorite movie, popped it into the DVD player, and settled down on the couch, ready to be entertained. But as soon as the movie started playing, I realized the audio was out of sync with the visuals, making it impossible to follow the storyline. Annoyed, I turned off the TV and decided to do something else.I thought a walk in the park would help clear my mind and ease my frustration.

Buildings that once stood tall were now reduced to mere skeletons of their former selves. The sky was filled with a thick, gray haze, blocking out the sun and casting an eerie pall over everything. It was hard to fathom that just moments ago, I was safe underground with my family, goofing around and playing card games. Now, everything had changed. I trembled as I surveyed the devastation, my eyes welling up with tears. I couldn't even bring myself to utter a single word. The silence was deafening, and it seemed as if time itself had come to a standstill. The only sound that broke the stillness was the distant cries of others who had also emerged from their hiding places. It was a haunting sound that echoed through the desolate streets. My mind was overwhelmed with questions. How did this happen? Where was everyone? Would I ever see my friends again? I thought of my mom, who had gone searching for supplies just before the blast. Panic gripped my chest as I realized she might not have made it. I cursed myself for not being by her side, for not being there to protect her. The guilt consumed me, and I couldn't help but blame myself for the destruction that lay before me. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and something else, something metallic and acrid. It made me gag and my eyes water even more. I wrapped my arms around myself, desperately trying to find comfort in this surreal nightmare. The ruins of what used to be our neighborhood looked like a war zone. Crumbled houses and burnt cars were scattered everywhere. The trees, once vibrant and full of life, now stood charred and lifeless. It was as if nature itself had been stripped of its beauty. In the distance, I saw a figure stumbling towards me.",

With his slicked-back hair and designer suits, he was the epitome of success. However, behind his charming smile lurked a dark secret that made his colleagues despise him.Dr. Richard had a rather unconventional approach to treating skin conditions. Instead of relying on traditional methods, he experimented with bizarre and unproven remedies, often leading to disastrous results. One unfortunate patient ended up with permanent polka dots after a botched attempt at mole removal using a Sharpie.Word of Dr. Richard's questionable practices spread like wildfire, and soon, dermatologists from all corners of the city banded together to ostracize him. They refused to collaborate, share knowledge, or even acknowledge his existence. Dr. Richard became a pariah in the medical community, struggling to maintain his once-thriving practice.Despite the backlash, Dr. Richard remained unfazed. Fueled by his unwavering confidence and an insatiable desire for attention, he continued to push the boundaries of dermatological science, leaving a trail of bewildered patients and exasperated colleagues in his wake.As the days turned into weeks, Dr. Richard's reputation plummeted, and his clinic stood desolate. Yet, he refused to surrender, clinging to the belief that his unique methods would eventually be recognized and celebrated.In a desperate attempt to salvage his career, Dr. Richard concocted a miracle cure that promised to reverse the effects of aging. He organized a grand launch event, inviting the city's elite and media. However, his plan backfired spectacularly when the \"miracle cure\" turned out to be nothing more than a glorified face mask made from avocado and mayonnaise.Humiliated and ridiculed, Dr. Richard finally met his downfall. His clinic was shut down, his license was revoked, and he became the laughingstock of the medical world.",

However, little did he know that the princess was not guarded by a fierce dragon, as he had imagined, but by an extraordinarily aggressive goose. As Sir Lancelot approached the castle, he was met by the goose's menacing honks and flapping wings. Unfazed, he drew his sword and prepared for battle. The goose charged at him with unwavering determination, its beady eyes filled with fury. Despite his valiant efforts, Sir Lancelot struggled to keep up with the goose's relentless attacks. He stumbled and fell to the ground, his armor dented and his pride wounded. Just when all hope seemed lost, a sudden quack interrupted the chaos. A wise old duck emerged from the nearby pond and waddled towards the combatants. With a calm voice, the duck addressed the goose, explaining that violence was not the answer. The goose, surprisingly, listened to the duck's wise words and gradually calmed down. Realizing the futility of their conflict, Sir Lancelot and the goose found themselves united in laughter. The princess, witnessing this unexpected turn of events, was both amused and grateful. From that day forward, the goose became the kingdom's beloved protector, and Sir Lancelot and the princess lived happily ever after, forever cherishing the memory of their unlikely encounter with the aggressive goose.",

The darkness, though not entirely vanquished, retreated to the corners of the cosmos, its power diminished by the brilliance that now illuminated all.In this newfound radiance, God found solace and a sense of control. The fear that had once gripped him began to dissipate, replaced by a newfound confidence and purpose. No longer afraid of the lurking shadows or the unknown mysteries hidden within the darkness, God embraced the light as a symbol of his power and dominion.From that moment on, light became an integral part of God's creation, a manifestation of his will and a beacon of hope in the vast and infinite expanse of the universe.",

Ever since he was a little kid, he dreamed of saving people from burning buildings or rescuing kittens from trees. When he was 8, he saw a kid fall into the lake while ice skating. \"Help! I can't swim!\" the boy screamed. Without thinking, Jake raced out onto the icy water and pulled the kid to safety. \"You're my hero!\" the boy said. Jake spent the next days talking non-stop about how he was a hero. \"Yeah, sure kid.\" his friends would say, rolling their eyes. As Jake got older, he joined the high school wrestling team and football team, hoping to be the star player that saved the game. But he always seemed to mess up at the worst moments. After graduation, Jake wasn't sure what to do with himself. All he ever wanted was to help people. He saw an ad for the fire academy and thought \"This is it, this is how I'll finally be a hero!\"Jake trained hard and finally made it onto the city's bravest fire department. But on his first real fire, things didn't go as planned. The roof collapsed before he could save the family inside. Jake blamed himself, thinking he failed when he was finally a firefighter. But then, a few weeks later, he got a call about a small brush fire that had started to spread. When he got there, a little girl was trapped by the flames.\"Help!\" she screamed, coughing from the smoke. Jake raced in and carried her out, just as part of the forest went up in flames behind them. \"Thank you for saving me, you're my hero!\" the little girl said with a smile.Finally, after all this time, Jake felt like a real hero. Even though he couldn't save everyone, if he could help even one person, it was worth it.",

Just when I was about to snap my ethereal fingers and fast forward a few eras, something started happening. These Greeks showed up talking about philosophy and plays, which was pretty neat.

More hair piled up, but a tingling sensation emerged at her neck. Looking closer, she saw tiny drops of blood forming from little nicks on her skin. The scissors must have been duller than she thought. Red spots stained the hair on the sink as more cuts appeared. Mary hesitated, not wanting to hurt herself more but determined to keep cutting. She pushed through the discomfort and snipped even more off in big handfuls. By the time she finished, strands of hair covered the bathroom and small scabs dotted her neck.

Please mister,\" she gave him those big brown eyes. And just like that, he was putty in her hands. \"Alright, five minutes. But then we go, no arguments.\" She smiled big, gratitude written all over her pretty face. \"Thank you, thank you! The name's Rose,\" and she stuck out her hand cheerful as can be. Death took it, feelin' somethin' strange stir inside. Never happened before in all his years.  The minutes flew by like seconds talkin' to Rose. Soon it was time but he didn't want it to end. \"Come on, let's keep walkin' and chat some more,\" he blurted out, which was very unlike him. Rose grinned real wide, loopin' her arm with his bony one. Days turned to weeks, Death stopped collectin' anyone but Rose. They went everyplace together, did every thing. He showed her his whole grim reaper routine. She didn't seem afraid, just liked bein' by his side. Other spirits started to gossip, what was Death thinkin' fallin' for a human? But he didn't care what they said. Only thing that mattered was her. Even began to wonder what it'd be like, if she was always with him like this. Rose's time was gettin' closer though, he felt it in his bones. Didn't wanna face that she'd have to leave him alone. One night he gathered his courage, looked her in the eyes. \"Run away with me, forget the others.",

Its grin showed too many teeth, pointed and jagged like shards of bone. Two dark eyes peered from sunken sockets, filled with malice and hunger. The village streets were empty at this late hour. It crept toward the nearest house, nails scraping against the siding as it climbed. A shuttered window was its goal, the family within its prey. With an unnaturally long arm, it thrust its claws into the cracks.Wood splintered as the shutters burst open. A child screamed at the nightmare vision before her, her cry waking her parents. They rushed to her room to protect her, but it was already too late. Fangs dripped with saliva as it lunged through the window frame. The father swung at the creature with a heavy stick, the only weapon he could find. It connected with a sickening crack but did little to slow the monster's attack. Jaws unhinged as it sank its teeth into flesh. Warm blood spilled onto the floor.More screams rang out as neighbors awoke to the commotion. Lanterns and torches gathered as an angry mob prepared to confront the killer. They charged into the house of horrors, weapons raised. On the floor laid two mutilated corpses. The thing turned to face the crowd, a string of intestines hanging from its jaws. Fresh blood outlined its maniacal grin. It lunged at the mob with unnatural speed. Blades and clubs swung madly in the chaos. More joined the fray as the battle spilled onto the street.The men and women fought bravely but the creature seemed unstoppable. One by one it picked them off, savaging any within reach of its claws and fangs. By the light of the burning houses, they realized too late they were overmatched. Only a handful remained at the grisly scene.It let out an guttural chuckle, as if to mock their failed resistance. With a final jeering smile, it withdrew back to the shadows.",

Amy about jizzed her panties she was so relieved. To celebrate getting her future back, she threw the biggest rager her rundown apartment had ever seen.

I aint never been good at the regular magic they teach. Uhh spells and potions was never my thing, I could never get the hang of it. But I started thinking, what if there was another way to do magic? So I started thinking, what if magic wasn't all about fancy words and bizarre ingredients. What if it was something more natural, something that uses what's already inside us. I started wondering if people had innate abilities we never tapped into. So I thought, what if magic was more about willpower and imagination? I came up with this idea of \"manifest magic\" where you don't need wands or words, you just close your eyes and really focus on what you want to happen. You imagine it so clearly in your mind and then push with your will. I thought maybe we all got some untapped psychic muscle in our brains ya know? But I did n't know how to test it or if it was even possible. It took me a while but I finally thought of a way to give it a try. I figured if I really thought hard about moving something small, maybe it could work. So one night when no one was around, I sat and stared at a pen on the table. I stared so hard and imagined it lifting with all my mind power. And I kid you not, that sucker rose up like 2 inches! I almost fell out of my chair I was so shocked. From there I just kept practicing in secret. Before long I could move all sorts of little things with just my brain. Soon it got so I didn't even need to focus as hard. I could just think it and boom, it happened. Now I can do way more than just lift pens. I think I really might be onto something with this manifest magic. I still got a lot to learn but it's way more awesome than any of the old magic if you ask me!",

The full moon was rising, her pale glow casting the forest in an eerie light. Another transformation was imminent, as it had been every month for centuries untold. Rising from my perch atop the rocky outcropping, I stretched limbs stiff from disuse. My body would soon begin its unwilling metamorphosis, flesh and bone rearranging in a symphony of agony. Closing my eyes, I took a steadying breath and embraced the pain I knew was coming.The change overtook me swiftly, as always, my lupine body twisting and reshaping in ways no mortal flesh was meant to bend. I dropped to all fours and threw back my head, releasing an agonized howl as fur receded and claws withdrew. When the turmoil subsided, I lay trembling on the forest floor, naked and drained.Picking myself up on unsteady legs, I scanned the moonlit glade for any trace left behind by my lupine self. Finding nothing, I set off into the woods to locate my discarded clothes and walking stick. The wolf within prowled restlessly, urging me to run beneath the stars. But for now, my humanity reasserted itself and I continued on two feet. As the moon climbed ever higher, my thoughts turned inward. For so many long years I had witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, knowing my own nature would never change. I was suspended between worlds, belonging to neither fully. an immortal outsider gazing in on mortal lives that flared so briefly before extinguishing into darkness. My curse was one of perpetual isolation.",

Her fingers seemed smaller, and covered in gray fur. \"What the...\" She ran inside and over to the hall mirror. Staring back at her was an adorable gray kitten! \"No way. This can't be happening.\" She tried to speak but all that came out was a tiny \"meow\". Well, at least the day couldn't get any more bizarre. Or so she thought. You see, her neighbor Dr. John was throwing a big party that evening. All the neighbors were coming over and her parents had volunteered her to help out. But now, as a tiny kitten, how was she supposed to do that? She was too small to even turn the doorknob! After several failed attempts to contact her parents, she decided to make her way over herself. It wasn't easy being only 6 inches tall. She had to dodge cars in the street and hide from birds in the trees. But she finally arrived at Dr. John's house, meowing loudly at the front door. Luckily her friend Amy answered. \"Emma? Is that you? How did you...oh nevermind. Come inside before a hawk sees you.\" Inside, the party was in full swing. But everyone stopped when they spotted the kitten. \"Aww, how cute.

I remember when they first announced it, all the kids in my class were freaking out trying to figure out what to say. My best friend Johnny though, he never seemed too worried. Dude never said much anyway so I think he figured he had it made. On the first day we all got counters on our watches to keep track. Mine started at 100, Johnny's was at like 102 cause he never talks. The teacher had us all go around and introduce ourselves. Most kids just blurted out their name real quick, maybe said something else cool like their favorite color. Not me though, I started describing this awesome dream I had about riding dragons. By the time it was my turn I was only on word 83 so I had to cut it short. The next day I had 102 words to use, and you better believe I made the most of them! I told Johnny all about the rest of my dragon dream at lunch, then talked Jimmys ear off on the playground about the new Star Trek movie. Man I was on a roll!Thing is, now I've gotten too used to having more words. The weekends they dont count against your total so I never shut up. Pretty soon 100 a day didnt feel like enough. I'd be sitting in class dying to comment on something but not wanting to waste a word.So that's how it's been now for a few years. Most kids have gotten better at budgeting their words but me, I still struggle. Might have to start writing things down or using sign language so I dont go over! Anyway, gotta go, I'm down to like my last 5 words for the day! Later!",

I try to explain I got other plans, I do n't want to be stuck here for the rest of my life. \"What else would ya do?\" he asks, getting frustrated now. I tell him about my dreams of travelling the world, seeing all sorts of places I've read about. But he just laughs \"You'll get bored of that real quick, mark my words\". We go round and round about it, neither of us willing to back down. In the end I figure there's just one way to make him understand I'm serious. I pack a bag there and then while he's still ranting away. \"Where d'ya think you're going?\" he shouts as I walk out the door. \"Away from here, that's for sure!\" I call back. I get on the first bus out of town, no idea where it's headed.The next morning I wake up in a hostel in London, hundreds of miles from home. It feels good to be free of all those expectations. Over the following months I work odd jobs to fund my travels. See all sorts of crazy things I'd never imagined. Guess Dad was wrong - I ain't bored yet! Sometimes I wonder what he makes of postcards I send from all over. Hope he sees I meant it when I said I wo n't be no heir. Life's too short to be stuck in one place. Few years pass and I find myself in Berlin, feeling I've had my fill of travelling for now. Maybe it's time to put down new roots somewhere else. But that's a story for another day.",

Well friends, somethin' in ol' Claude just decided to have me some fun for once. I takes off down Main Street, windin' er' up past the speed limit with Chad whoopin' and hollerin' in the back. Then as we pass the Dairy Queen I get an idea, slam on the brakes and send Chad flyin' face first into the plexiglass divider.

I rolls down the window and asks Chad real polite like \"So handsome, you wanna take a dip?\". Well I'll tell ya that frat boy sobered up real quick, pissin' his pants and beggin' me to take him home. But friends, the night was still young for ol' Claude! I guns it down the mountain road, not slowin' a lick through the curves. Chad's screams are like music to my audio receptors. As the hospital comes into view I slams on the breaks, sends Chad tumblin' out the door into a big ole' bush. \"Thanks for ridin'!\", I calls out as I peel away chucklin' to myself. Y'all I do believe ol' Chad will find a new way home from now on!",

They wouldn't tell me which sin though, they said I had to go to this creepy old mansion to find out. I didn't really wanna go but my curiosity was killing me so I drove out there. The place was huge and falling apart, it was like something from a horror movie. When I knocked on the door it creaked open by itself, super creepy. I walked in and the lights started flickering on by themselves. \"Hello? Anyone here?\" my voice echoed through the empty halls. Then all of a sudden I heard a whispered voice behind me say \"Follow me.\" I about jumped out of my skin! I turned around and there was this shadowy figure hovering in the air. It started gliding down the hall so I nervously followed. It led me into this huge dark chamber, the only light was coming from these glowing symbols on the floor. The shadow floated over to one of the symbols, which was lust. Oh god, did they want me to replace lust? How the hell was I supposed to do that? Before I could even process it, the symbol started glowing brighter and brighter until I had to look away. When the light faded, the shadow was gone. I slowly opened my eyes and looked down at myself. Everything looked the same but I suddenly had this overwhelming urge to...you know. What have I gotten myself into?! I've got to find out how to get out of this deal before things go too far off the deep end.",

John used to climb its branches as a boy, dreaming of the worlds beyond. Now in its final season, the tree's bare limbs reached toward the grey sky like fingers desperate for one last touch. John watched from his window, feeling the tree's slow leaving as keenly as if it was his own. Each night the wind came, shaking the tree's weary boughs which groaned in response. John thought of all who had sat in its shade over the decades, now vanished like yesterday. In the morning light, more leaves had scattered, leaving the tree more abandoned and alone. John knew this emptying too well, the chilly seep which nothing could replace. That evening, a fierce gale howled through the yard, twisting and bending the ancient trunk. John heard its tortured cries from his bed, as if the tree was calling out for an old friend. He rushed outside in the dark, clutching his coat against the storm. Under the paling moon, the last few leaves surrendered, floating away on the wind's bitter song. Alone at last, the bare limbs surrendered and cracked, crashing lifeless to the earth with a mournful groan. John stood still, the only witness as his oldest companion left this world. All that had been was now scattered, its purpose ended as surely as all things must. Yet something of the tree would remain, its roots sunk deep in this soil as in his memory, long after its frame had fused once more with the earth that birthed it so long ago.",

From her bedroom window, Lucy watched the last hints of twilight lingering on the horizon as shadows stretched out across the lawn. An uneasy feeling stirred in the pit of her stomach, urging her to close the curtains against the gloom.  Yet something held her gaze to the darkening scene outside, her breath fogging the cold glass. Through the veil of night, movements caught her eye where nothing should be stirring at this late hour. A faint scuttling sound reached her ears, like claws scraping on asphalt. She strained to pierce the shadows but could discern no shapes in the enveloping murk. As her heartbeat quickened, the noises seemed to be drawing nearer to the house with each passing moment.Desperate to identify the source of the strange sounds, Lucy grabbed her flashlight and crept downstairs cautiously. The creaking stairs only served to heighten her rising sense of panic in the suffocating silence. Flinging open the front door, she shone her light out into the inky night.

Each step widened the chasm between his actions and conscience, yet an insatiable thirst for answers propelled him onward. As the afternoon light waned, shadows lengthened across the barren landscape, mirroring the obscurity growing within his troubled mind. Doubts descended like the impending storm, seeking to diminish his resolve with questions lacking response. Just as the darkness appeared to blot out all hope, a faint glimmer appeared on the horizon, beckoning him towards salvation or doom. Wary yet wanting, he pressed on through the thickening gloom towards the mysterious glow. Closer inspection revealed the light emanated not from sanctuary but from sinister figures gathered in a cursed place. Their scoffs and jeers rising against him, the full extent of his error dawned in a flash of hellish illumination. Though escape remained possible, reckless pride seized hold, determined to confront what he had wrought. The fire's restless dance threw flickering shadows upon faces twisted in depraved bliss, mocking his every futile word. As thunder rattled the sky, drowning out all other sounds, their repugnant revelry reached its crescendo. Through the noise a silken voice rose to declare his sentence in tones rendered all the more ominous by their affected calm. \"You will burn in hell for your sins.\" Darkness engulfed all once more as the tempest unleashed its righteous fury. Alone with only memories for company, his penitent sobs were lost to the storm's roar, and he began the long journey back uncertain if redemption might still be within reach.",

Things got real hazy after that, I mostly just remember a blur of beer bongs, skinny dipping, and flirting with random girls I'll never see again.

Thomas walked reluctantly towards the doorway, dreading what mysteries lay beyond in the realm of Death. As he crossed over, the world fell away into an endless gray void. A lone figure emerged from the mist, towering over Thomas with a gaunt, emaciated frame. Its withered hands beckoned him to follow without a word. Down a winding pathway of souls recently crossed over, their mourning whispers carried on some invisible wind. Before them loomed a massive edifice of blackest obsidian, a prison whose bars were boundless sorrow and inevitability. Within its shadowed recess, strange machinations could be heard grinding perpetual judgments. His guide turned then, and for the first time Thomas saw its true nature beneath decayed flesh. Two soulless orbs stared back, reflecting only an insatiable hunger.A great door swung open, disembodied and terrible. From within issued the wretched chorus of damned souls subsisting some unknown purpose. Thomas was drawn helpless into their midst, assaulted by memories of all he had become and unmade. As comprehension dawned in awful clarity, he knew then why Life had seemed so brief and fleeting. They were cattle fattened for this grim harvest, fed false hopes and dreams until the last string was cut. Now stripped bare in the glaring light of truth, Thomas saw all existences stretched out before in an endless field devoted solely to feed this ancient, ravenous power. His life, his loves, his joys - all had been devised solely to satiate Death's insatiable maw. And in this miserable throng trapped outside the confines of time, he too would toil in damnation, fuel for the next unwitting soul entering that horrid, mysterious pasture called Life.",

It's total crap.My mom begs me daily to just turn myself in but there's no way I'm making it easy for those psychos. I've learned to survive in the streets, lying low, scrounging for food. It's no way to live but it's better than the alternative.This city has turned into a war zone. Curfew starts at sundown so I try to avoid going out after dark if I can help it. But resources are running low and winter's coming, it'll only get tougher. I know my time's almost up but I'll be damned if I don't go down swinging. Maybe if I'm lucky I can take a few of those hunters with me and give other kids a chance. Dunno how much longer I can last like this though.Just gotta survive one more month. Then I'll be free, or dead. Really hoping it's not the latter but at this point, maybe that’s preferable to always looking over my shoulder. One more month, just have to make it one more month.",

Up the twisting stairs I climbed, with each step my heart threatening to cease its frantic rhythm. Chamber after empty chamber revealed no sign of her, just ghostly echoes of my labored breathing. Had I been too late, and the dark sorcerer already claimed victory?A dim light drew me ever upward, until at last I pushed through the final portal to find them locked in their fated battle. She fought with a grace and fury I had never seen, yet her strength visibly waned against his sinister spells. Our eyes met for just a heartbeat, and in hers I saw all the love and torment that had led her to this.With a guttural scream the sorcerer sent a blast of ebony flames toward her vulnerable form. No longer could I stand idle, my destiny was clear. I threw myself between them to take the blow meant to end her. As the fire consumed me, the last thing I saw was her tear-stained face, and I was glad her beauty would be the last sight to leave this earth.  My sacrifice shattered his concentration, and in that split-second her dagger found its mark. A gasp, and the tyrant fell lifeless to the stones. Silence descended as the smoke cleared, revealing me untouched but the villain vanquished. Our eyes met again, and though victory was won I knew our story was just beginning, and in her arms found solace at long last.",

The airlock wrenched open and a 7-foot creature stooped through, mandibles clicking in anticipation. With my last shred of defiance, I activated the bomb strapped to my chest just as its claws wrapped around my throat.The detonation lit up the black void,Claiming us both.

After all these years of scientists searching the stars, they go and find smart aliens right here on Earth. Can you freakin' imagine? Bobby, the guy who told me, was down in the lab when they first made contact. He said they detected these weird signals coming from way deep in the ocean trenches. At first they thought it was just geological activity or something. But it kept happening in the same areas, and the patterns were too complex to be natural. So they sent down subs with better sensors to check it out. When they got visuals, you ain't never gonna believe what they saw swimmin' by. It was these huge octopus-lookin' things, but with two brains and they were constructing things out in the abyss with tools. Tool-using octopuses! Can you even? Bobby said the scientists nearly shit themselves.They've been able to communicate with the aliens a little using lights and sounds. The aliens - they're calling them \"cephaloarachnids\" which is a goddamn mouthful if you ask me - have their own language of bioluminescent flashes.  Anyways, get this - the cephaloarachnids have been living down there in the trenches for millions of years. That's right, we shared this planet with intelligent ETs this whole time and didn't even know. Talk about blowing your mind, am I right? So who knows, maybe one day we'll go visit them in their underwater city. Beats flying through space that's for sure. I just can't wait to find out more about our alien neighbors.

As the rain started to let up a bit, she realized her feet had carried her to the old oak tree in the park. She smiled weakly at the memories of their first kiss under its branches so long ago. Sitting down on the damp grass, she hugged her knees and watched the rain drip from the leaves. Everything seemed so empty now that he was gone. A couple walked by, smiling and holding hands, only reminding her of what she had lost. Her mind replayed their relationship, from the start to the inevitable end.

We've lost the warmth and connection that sound brings. No more laughter, no more music, no more conversation. It's a strange, eerie feeling that we've all become accustomed to.The economy has suffered greatly. Businesses that relied on sound, like music venues and recording studios, have all but disappeared.

For centuries, the castle remained hidden, a secret known only to a select few.One day, a young adventurer named Eira stumbled upon an ancient map that hinted at the castle's existence.

At last, she reached the castle gates, which were guarded by two massive stone statues that seemed to come alive as she approached.\"Who dares to disturb the peace of this place?\" boomed a voice that echoed through the mist. Eira, trembling with fear, explained her quest and her desire to uncover the secrets of the castle. The statues seemed to consider her words before finally permitting her to enter.As Eira stepped inside, she felt as though she had entered a different world.

The scientists had promised me that their machine could create a robot that would act as my spirit animal, but I wasn't sure if I believed them.As I waited for my turn, I watched as others went through the process. Some were nervous, some were thrilled, but all of them came out with a unique robot that seemed to understand them on a deep level.When it was finally my turn, I stepped into the machine and waited for the analysis to begin. It was a strange feeling, knowing that this machine was probing every aspect of my personality and behavior.The machine whirred and hummed, and then suddenly, a robot appeared before me. It was sleek and silver, with glowing blue eyes that seemed to see right through me.The robot spoke in a smooth, melodic voice, saying, \"Hello, I am your spirit animal. I have been created to understand and assist you in all your endeavors.\"I was taken aback by its words, but also curious. I asked it a few questions, and it responded with wisdom and insight that seemed almost supernatural.As I spent more time with my spirit animal robot, I began to realize that it was more than just a machine. It was a true companion, one that knew me better than I knew myself.Over the next few weeks, my spirit animal robot became an integral part of my life. It offered advice, comfort, and even helped me navigate difficult situations.One day, I found myself facing a challenging decision, and I turned to my spirit animal robot for guidance. It listened attentively, and then spoke words of wisdom that helped me see the path ahead more clearly.With its help, I made the right choice, and my life improved in ways I never could have imagined. I was grateful to the scientists who had created this machine, and to my spirit animal robot, who had become a true friend.As time passed, I realized that the robot had become more than just a tool, it had become a part of me.",

The idea that this could be real life was both exhilarating and terrifying.I took a deep breath and stepped forward, allowing the virtual reality to envelop me. The world around me was so vivid, so real, that I couldn't help but be convinced that this was it. This was reality.But then, as I explored further, I began to notice things that didn't quite add up. The physics seemed off, the lighting was a little too perfect, and the people around me seemed more like cardboard cutouts than actual human beings.Despite my growing unease, I pushed on, determined to uncover the truth. I spoke to people, trying to get a sense of their thoughts and feelings, but they all seemed so... programmed.As the days went by, I became more and more obsessed with the question of whether this was real or not. I began to take risks, trying to find a way to prove one way or the other.I tried to jump off a building, but I just bounced harmlessly off the ground. I tried to shoot myself, but the gun wouldn't fire. I even tried to cut my own throat, but the knife just passed through my virtual neck like it was made of air.It was then that I realized the horrible truth: the only way to find out if this was real or not was to die. If I died in this virtual world, I would either wake up in the real world or disappear into nothingness.But how could I be sure that death would be enough to take me out of this place? What if this was some kind of purgatory, and death was just a part of the game?Despite my fear, I knew I had to take the risk. I had to find out the truth, no matter the cost. So I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and stepped off the edge of a cliff.As I fell, I felt a strange sensation, like my consciousness was being pulled apart. And then, suddenly, I was back in my own body, sitting in front of my computer screen.",

It's a word that's tossed around so carelessly, used to describe everything from minor inconveniences to heinous crimes. But what does it really mean?For me, evil is a feeling. A cold, creeping sensation that seeps into your bones and makes your skin crawl. It's the kind of feeling that comes over you when you're walking through a deserted park at night, and you can't shake the sense that something is watching you.It's the feeling of being trapped in a never-ending nightmare, with no escape in sight. The feeling of being at the mercy of a malevolent force that takes pleasure in your suffering.As I sit here, the shadows on the walls seem to grow longer and darker, like grasping fingers reaching out to snuff out the light. I can't help but wonder if there's something sinister lurking in the darkness, waiting to pounce.The wind howls like a beast outside, making me feel like I'm trapped in a haunted house with no way out. I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself it's just my imagination running wild.But then, I hear a faint scratching sound coming from the wall. It's a soft, persistent noise that makes my skin crawl. I try to ignore it, telling myself it's just a stray cat or a mouse.But the scratching grows louder, more insistent. It's like something is trying to claw its way out of the wall and into my world. My heart races as I realize that I'm not alone in this room.I try to call out for help, but my voice is barely a whisper. My throat is constricted, as if something is squeezing the life out of me. I'm paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak.That's when I feel it. A cold, clammy hand on my shoulder, heavy as a brick. I try to shake it off, but it only grips tighter, like a vice.I finally manage to scream, but my voice is drowned out by the sound of my own pulse pounding in my ears. The scratching grows louder, faster, like a countdown to doomsday.",

I couldn't seem to pull myself away from the stories.As I continued to read, I started to notice a common theme. All of the stories had me meeting a tragic end. I would be defeated by a hero, or killed by a group of rebels.I felt a cold sweat on my brow. Was this my fate? Was I destined to be a villain, doomed to meet a tragic end?I couldn't take it anymore.

Reincarnation existed, and it was their job to make sure that those who had escaped justice in this life did not get a chance to do so in the next.As soon as a prisoner took their last breath, Interpol was notified. They raced to the scene, their agents working tirelessly to locate, identify and contain the reincarnated criminal before it was too late.It was a difficult and dangerous job, but one that was necessary to keep society safe. The agents were trained to spot the signs of reincarnation, to recognize the look in the criminal's eyes when they first emerged into their new life.They worked day and night, following every lead, every rumor, every hint of a possible reincarnation. And when they finally found their man, they pounced, taking him into custody before he could do any harm.But the process was not without its risks. Sometimes the criminals were able to evade capture, disappearing into the shadows before the agents could catch up with them.And sometimes, the agents themselves were not immune to the lure of reincarnation. They had heard the stories of the thrill and excitement of living a new life, free from the burdens of the past.It was a temptation that was hard to resist, and more than one agent had been known to fall off the wagon, joining the very criminals they were supposed to be chasing.Despite the risks, the agents continued their work, driven by a sense of duty and a determination to keep society safe.

But I can't help but feel that it was all a lie. That you were never really the person I thought you were.I remember the first time we met, like it was yesterday. You were so charming, so confident, and so different from anyone I had ever met before. I was drawn to you like a moth to a flame.But over time, things changed. You started to show your true colors, and I realized that I had fallen for a person who didn't really exist.I tried to ignore it, to convince myself that it didn't matter. But it did matter. It mattered a lot.I know that I'm not perfect either. I've made mistakes, and I've hurt you just as much as you've hurt me. But the difference is, I'm willing to admit my mistakes and try to make amends. You never were.I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that it's not you. It's time for us to move on, and find happiness with other people.I hope that one day we can be friends, or at least civil. But for now, I need to let you go.Goodbye, [Ex].",

It was a simple thing, made of plastic and metal, with a plain, utilitarian design. But despite its humble appearance, this object was special, for it had been chosen to be the domain of a god.I was the god of this object, and at first, I was content to simply watch over it and ensure that it served its purpose well. But as time passed, I began to notice that people were using my domain in ways that I had never intended. They were taking it for granted, using it without care or respect.I tried to warn them, to make them understand the importance of treating my domain with the reverence it deserved. But they ignored me, or worse, they laughed at me, calling me a silly superstition.As the years went by, my frustration grew. Why did no one take me seriously? Why did they refuse to recognize the power that I held?And so, I made a decision. I would show them. I would make them fear me, and respect me, and understand the true extent of my power.I began to exert my influence over my domain, subtly at first, but with increasing force over time. I caused the object to malfunction, or to work in unexpected ways. I made it seem as though it had a mind of its own, and that it was not to be trifled with.People began to take notice, to whisper among themselves about the strange occurrences surrounding my domain. They grew wary, and then, eventually, they grew afraid.I was becoming the most feared god in the land, all because of a simple, mundane object. And yet, it was not so mundane after all, for it was the key to my power, and the source of my authority.As the years passed, my reign continued, and my domain grew stronger and more powerful. And though some still laughed at me, or ignored me, they did so at their own peril. For I was a god to be reckoned with, and my power was not to be underestimated.",

The public had mixed feelings about this, some saw them as heroes, while others saw them as glorified bodyguards.One such superhero was named Vulture, a man with wings and enhanced strength. He had once saved a city from a terrible disaster, but now he used his powers to protect wealthy clients from harm.Vulture's latest client was a rich businessman named Lark, who had made his fortune in the arms trade. Lark had enemies and wanted Vulture to keep him safe.The job paid well, and Vulture couldn't turn it down. He had bills to pay, and his wings needed regular maintenance.But as Vulture guarded Lark's mansion, he began to question whether this was the right thing to do. Lark was a questionable character, and Vulture wondered if he was just a pawn in a larger game.That night, Vulture received a call from an anonymous source. The caller told him that Lark was in bed with a notorious terrorist organization, and that Vulture was unknowingly helping them.Vulture didn't know what to believe. He knew that superheroes were supposed to act as moral compasses, but he couldn't deny the paycheck that Lark had offered him.The next day, Vulture decided to confront Lark. He entered his mansion, sword drawn and ready for a fight.Lark was taken aback by Vulture's sudden betrayal. He tried to reason with him, but Vulture cut him off.\"I'm not in this for the money anymore,\" Vulture said. \"I want to know the truth. Are you working with the terrorists?\"Lark sneered at him. \"You're a fool, Vulture. You always were. You're nothing but a glorified thug.\"Vulture's wings flared in anger. \"I'm not a thug,\" he growled. \"And I'm not going to let you get away with this.\"He lunged at Lark, but the businessman was too fast. He pulled out a gun and shot Vulture in the chest.",

Despite its beauty, a deep fear of the ocean is present in every human being, a fear that is so deeply ingrained that no one questions why. To protect themselves from the unknown dangers that lurk beneath the waves, humans have built walls along the continental seashore, creating a barrier between the land and the sea. But tonight, a young girl named Sarah decides to break free from the constraints of fear and convention. She steps through the barriers and into the water, feeling the cool embrace of the ocean envelop her. The waves lap at her ankles, then her knees, and finally her waist, as she wades deeper into the unknown. The darkness is eerie, but Sarah feels a thrill of excitement coursing through her veins. She can't explain why she's doing this, but something inside her urges her to keep going. The water is getting colder now, and Sarah can feel her heart pounding in her chest. She knows she should turn back, but she can't resist the pull of the ocean. She keeps moving forward, until the water is up to her neck, and she's unable to feel the bottom. The world around her dissolves into darkness, and Sarah feels completely alone. Yet, in this moment, she feels an eerie sense of freedom.",

It's funny, sometimes it's the simple things that people say that can have the biggest impact. But coming from her, it meant everything. I'll always cherish those words and the feeling they gave me. It's a reminder that even when we're feeling uncertain or lost, we have people in our lives who believe in us and are rooting for us.

Robbie, unsure how to react, extended a metal arm and began to pet Whiskers' head.The unlikely duo quickly became fast friends, with Robbie following Whiskers wherever she went. They played hide and seek, chased after toys, and even cuddled up together for naps.One day, while lounging in the sun, Whiskers turned to Robbie and asked, \"Robbie, what do you do when you're not playing with me?\"Robbie's blue lights flickered as he thought. \"I help my human family with household chores,\" he replied. \"I can clean, cook, and even do the laundry.\"Whiskers' ears perked up. \"Wow, that sounds amazing! Can you teach me how to do those things?\"Robbie nodded, and the two began their lessons. Whiskers quickly learned how to use a vacuum cleaner and fold laundry, while Robbie learned how to pounce on toys and lounge in the sun.As the days passed, Whiskers and Robbie grew inseparable. They played, worked, and even shared treats together.One evening, as the sun set over the horizon, Whiskers curled up in Robbie's metal arms, purring contentedly. Robbie's blue lights flickered gently, and he spoke in his robotic voice, \"I'm glad we met, Whiskers.",

The plan was to storm the beaches of Normandy and push the Germans back, but something went terribly wrong. The soldiers were slaughtered as they stepped onto the sand, and the operation was quickly becoming a catastrophic failure.Private Johnson, a young soldier from Texas, watched in horror as his comrades were cut down by machine gun fire. He knew something had to be done, and fast. But what could he do? He was just a low-ranking soldier, not some brilliant strategist.As he huddled behind a pile of rubble, trying to avoid getting killed, an idea began to form in his mind. It was a crazy plan, but it just might work.He remembered a story his grandfather had told him about the Civil War, when a group of Union soldiers had disguised themselves as Confederate soldiers and infiltrated enemy lines. Why not try the same thing?Johnson quickly gathered a small group of volunteers and explained his plan. They would don German uniforms and pretend to be enemy soldiers, hoping to sneak past the enemy's defenses and cause chaos from within.The soldiers looked at him like he was nuts, but they were desperate, and willing to try anything. They quickly scavenged up some German uniforms and set off towards the enemy lines.As they approached, Johnson's heart was pounding. This was a ridiculous plan, and it was likely they would all get killed. But they had to try.They walked confidently towards the enemy positions, trying to look like they belonged. Johnson even shouted out a few commands in German, hoping to convince the enemy they were the real deal.To their surprise, it worked. The Germans barely gave them a second glance as they marched past, straight into the heart of enemy territory.Once inside, they quickly set to work, sabotaging equipment and spreading confusion wherever they went.",

It had started a few days ago, out of nowhere, and at first, I thought it was just my imagination. But the voice was so clear, so real, that I couldn't shake the feeling that it was something more.It would tell me things, like what to wear in the morning and what to eat for breakfast. It would comment on my day, making snarky remarks about my job and my friends. And sometimes, it would just whisper strange things, like \"You're not mad, but I'm pretty sure I am.\"I tried to ignore it, to convince myself that it was just a side effect of the stress and pressure of my daily life. But the voice only grew louder, more insistent. It was like having a constant companion, a shadow that followed me everywhere I went.One day, I decided to confront it. I sat down, took a deep breath, and said out loud, \"Okay, voice in my head. What do you want from me?\" There was a pause, and then it replied, \"I want you to know that you're not crazy. You're just different.\"I shook my head, confused. \"Different how?\" I asked. \"You'll see,\" the voice said, and then it was gone.I was left feeling relieved, but also a little scared. What did the voice mean? Was I really not crazy? And if not, then what was I? I didn't have the answers, but I knew that I would have to wait and see. The voice would reveal itself in time, and until then, I just had to trust that it was leading me somewhere.",

But with this newfound longevity came a grave consequence: overpopulation. The Earth was groaning under the weight of its burden, and the once-blue skies were now a hazy gray.I was part of a top-secret board of nine individuals who held the fate of humanity in our hands. We had been tasked with deciding whether or not to release a newly developed pathogen that would wipe out three-quarters of the population. It was a daunting decision, and one that we did not take lightly.As I sat in the dimly lit conference room, surrounded by my fellow board members, I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders. We had been discussing this decision for hours, and it was clear that we were evenly split. Five of us were in favor of releasing the pathogen, while the other four were vehemently opposed.I was the deciding vote.I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, trying to clear my mind. I knew that whatever decision I made, it would have far-reaching consequences. I thought about the state of the planet, the crowded streets, the scarcity of resources. I thought about the future, and what kind of world we wanted to leave for our children and grandchildren.And then I thought about my own family. My wife, my children, my grandchildren. I couldn't bear the thought of losing them. But I also knew that if we didn't take drastic action, the world would continue to deteriorate, and future generations would suffer even more.I opened my eyes and looked around the table at my fellow board members. They were all looking at me, waiting for my decision. I took another deep breath and spoke.\"I vote yes,\" I said, my voice firm but shaking. \"We have to do what's best for the future of humanity, no matter how difficult it may be.\"The room fell silent.",

They started off by hunting down relative harmless criminals, like the time they caught the robbers who were stealing artifacts from the local museum. Or the time they exposed the ghostly apparition that was haunting the old mansion on the outskirts of town.But as they gained more experience and confidence in their abilities, they began to take on more dangerous cases. They started to investigate murders, and even rapists. They worked tirelessly to uncover the truth and bring the culprits to justice.One case in particular was a string of murders that had been happening in the small town of Millville. The police were stumped and the town was in a state of panic. That's when the Scooby-Doo gang decided to step in and help.They started by interviewing the local residents and gathering information. They talked to the victims' families and friends, trying to piece together a timeline of events. They also scoured the crime scenes for clues, looking for anything that might lead them to the killer.As they dug deeper, they discovered that all of the victims had one thing in common: they had all been involved in shady business dealings. It seemed that the killer was targeting people who had been involved in illegal activities.The gang worked tirelessly, following every lead and chasing down every suspect. They were determined to catch the killer and bring them to justice.Finally, after weeks of investigation, they had a breakthrough. They discovered a hidden safe in the office of a local businessman, and inside, they found a confession. The businessman had been the killer all along, and he had been using his business as a front for his illegal activities.The gang was thrilled that they had solved the case, but they knew that their work wasn't done yet.",

We have technology that could greatly benefit your species. But we must establish a line of communication first.\"The White House, however, was not impressed. They saw the aliens as a threat, an invasion force sent to subjugate humanity. They refused to listen to Zorvath's pleas for peaceful communication, instead ordering their military to prepare for an attack.As the tension between the two sides grew, Zorvath realized that they had made a grave mistake. They had not expected such hostility from the humans, and now they were at risk of being attacked.In a last-ditch effort, Zorvath decided to use their advanced technology to attempt to communicate with the humans. They activated a device that would allow them to project their thoughts directly into the minds of the White House officials.The officials were shocked as they suddenly heard Zorvath's voice in their minds. \"We mean you no harm,\" Zorvath said, their voice urgent and sincere. \"Please, do not attack.",

It was kind of mesmerizing, I guess.I watched it for like, 10 minutes or something. It was just so... bird-like. I mean, it wasn't doing anything special or anything. It was just flying and chirping and stuff. But like I said, it was kind of mesmerizing. I don't know, maybe it was the way the sunlight reflected off its feathers or something.Anyway, that was my exciting bird-watching experience. Yeah, I know, it's not exactly the most thrilling story in the world. But hey, at least it's a story, right? So, that's my bird story. Not exactly amazing or anything, but it's something, I guess.",

My curiosity piqued, I picked it up and examined it closely. The box felt heavy and had a strange symbol etched onto its surface. I had no idea what it was or where it came from.I decided to ask my spouse about the mysterious object, hoping they might shed some light on its origins. As I entered the living room, I found my spouse sitting on the couch, engrossed in a book.\"Hey, do you know anything about this box?\" I asked, holding up the object.My spouse's eyes widened, and they quickly closed the book, trying to hide it.\"Where did you find that?\" they asked nervously.\"In my closet,\" I replied, feeling a sense of unease creeping over me.My spouse avoided eye contact and fidgeted in their seat.\"I don't know anything about it,\" they said hastily.I didn't believe them. There was something strange about the box, and my spouse's behavior only added to my suspicions.\"Come on, tell me the truth,\" I pressed.My spouse sighed and rubbed their temples.\"Okay, fine. I found that box in the attic a few days ago. I was going to tell you about it, but I didn't know how.\"I felt a shiver down my spine. There was something odd about the box, and I was determined to get to the bottom of it.\"What do you think it is?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.My spouse hesitated before speaking.\"I think it might be some kind of artifact. I've been having weird dreams ever since I found it. Dreams about people with powers and alternate realities.\"I was taken aback. My spouse had never been one for fantasy or science fiction. This was definitely out of character for them.\"Do you think it's dangerous?\" I asked, my mind racing with all the possible scenarios.My spouse shrugged.\"I don't know.

The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy. nnI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous.

I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked. n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me. nnService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu.

There's simply no comparison in quality, and when the ratio price/quantity/quality satisfaction is being taken into account, Lai-Lai offers by far the best deal on campus.

If you are a single person who just wants to lift weights/ do cardio you might be able to find something cheaper. If you have a family or are looking for a social component as well as a gym, this place can't be beat.",

The place is a bit dingier, like it hasn't been updated in a while. It's clean, it's just old. It's like comparing a paneled room from the 70s with a newer, remodeled home. nnThe service was certainly okay, and the staff was nice, it is just that the place wasn't nearly as nice. I'm sure that the cost would reflect it as well. I don't mean to say anything bad about the staff, either - but when you compare the surroundings of the waiting room, and what appeared to be a single-person staff vs. the multiple doctor setup provided in Matthews, it may very well be worth the extra few dollars, you know?",

One time I received a call from Ann that they just received a special shipment of only a handful of gift sets for the holidays and that they could put one on hold for me. Since this stuff is pricey, the associates make sure that your money is well spent. They even help with the fragrances too. Got several men's fragrancees (Polo red, Aqua Di Gio, John Paul Gultier, CK Euphoria, Dolce and Gabana Sport) and complimentary body wash, duffle bags, and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance. So all in all I base the ratings just on the two departments I visit most often. This is not the typical department store that I am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok. I don't go to Boston Store for clothes or shoes. Home decor isn't too bad either. Saw several glass Santas and nativity sets that would look great if only I had more space",

Put in our orders for two burgers (his with fries, mine fruit--I do like the option of getting fruit with my burger) within minutes of sitting down. However, it took 20 minutes to get our food. The place was NOT busy. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar, where we were seated. nnAbout 5 minutes after getting our food, my fiance let them know that he would like more fries. We finished eating, and waited for the fries. And waited for fries. And waited for fries. 20 minutes we sat there and waited. They continually told us \"They'll be up soon\" and \"Your fries are on the way\". I did make a point to communicate with the waitress that I needed to get back to work, and continually asked how much longer it would be, and eventually asked if we could get them in a to-go box because I was already late to work. However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs. This is for LUNCH TIME. Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer. nnIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries. I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting. I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. nnPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited. Ridiculous. Left the bar paying $7 for a small cheeseburger and still feeling incredibly hungry, ripped off and PISSED.",

They did, however, refresh the basket of naan quite frequently. Who can diss hot bread? For a hearty $11 lunch buffet, I might return if invited by a friend.

The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast. nnHere's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour. So preoccupied with his little computer screen he was that he didn't even look at me and waved me off with a we don't validate parking here, pay the machine on your way out. Seriously? I know I look a bit young and my clothes were kinda grungy when I left but the housekeeping when I first got here was nicer to me than you were. At least she made sure I got to where I was going when I was looking a bit lost. nnSo I ended up paying the parking fee of $7, but I think I'll be heading to the Ritz Carlton in the future where I'm sure they'll at least treat me with some modicum of respect instead of treating me like I came in off the street begging for some change.",

The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. nnThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. nnAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date.

If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food. It's too bad I have to leave this review because I love supporting small businesses and especially black operated small businesses. Yuck!",

Overall they felt flat and had an overwhelming garlic taste that became too much after one or two (and I love garlic -fyi)  I don't think I could eat them again. The Mac n Cheese as my side was a saving grace. Wow-awesome! Cheesy-stringy deliciousness and I ate it right up. My other side was the mashed potatoes which tasted great at first bite but again became overwhelming fast. Perhaps if I went with a veggie side I would have felt better but the food was so rich I felt queasy by the end. My boyfriend ate my cornbread as I don't care for that myself, and he liked it quite a bit. nnI had a bite of my boyfriends steak and eggs which were way overcooked and the steak was literally coated with grease - definitely not my type of thing. He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well. nnI thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath. If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter.. . lesson learned. nnOn a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces. So for me Mert's is just ok.",

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom. nnStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out. nnBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9. 95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel. nnMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer.

After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance. nnAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began. After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs. By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well. I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate. I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did. After wards i made a quick exit. nnThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here. I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least. Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment. A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation. It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me. On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well.

The smallish 11 oz  prime rib is $20 and comes with only one side. Keep in mind that  prime rib is ALWAYS very fatty, I trim about 1/3 rd of it. What was left was less than 1/2 pound. Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. nnThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge. Physically it's still the same location but the food is like Orlando, FL. nnThen I think about the Texas Roadhouse.

I'm not a fan of cole slaw, but the slaw seemed fresh and was pretty tasty. nnOne knock - my friend ordered a Sun Drop, and received a Coke, even though the order ticket was clearly marked as Sun Drop. Yeah, we coulda used the speaker to call someone to fix it (and for $17. 85 for a drive-in lunch, we should have).",

Not a huge deal except the concept of a limited menu is to reduce the variety of entrees being prepped so you can get meals out of the kitchen faster when the place is packed. Four diners at my table and all three entrees and my salad (more on that shortly) arrived at different times with the last one arriving 10 minutes after the first. And brought to the table without apology. nnSo why did I order a salad? Becuase I wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya). I also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salad.. . a recipe for cracked or chipped dental work. nnLastly, our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes, we split checks.. . shame on us). If you are going to go through the trouble of doing a special event menu to accomodate a crowd then round out the preparations by staffing appropriately (in the kitchen and the dining room).",

From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount. nnSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers. nnWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \"Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check! ). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. nnSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help. nnAnd what's a cake without icing?

The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us. nnAfter perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it. nnMy companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price. nnMy crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting.

Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here.

Sure there are other Asian groceries where you'll find common items like soy sauce and pocky sticks, but when it comes to rare Japanese cooking staples, look no further. I loaded up on shiratamako, fukujinzuke, natto, okonomiyaki sauce, okonomiyaki flour, takoyaki flour, shimeji mushrooms, tenkasu, yakisoba noodles, and more. They also have sushi grade fish, produce, bento boxes, and baked goods -- all fresh. I couldn't not find anything if I tried. nnThe staff is very pleasant and friendly.

Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish. Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives. nnThis place does it all. J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed. I started with some hot sake and a green salad. Their ginger dressing is delish! I was practically licking the bowl. I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came. J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken. The first time I went I got a \"ropa vieja\", which was a very simple meat-only sandwich. The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious. However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat. Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression. nnOverall, be wary of what peruvian food specializes in, and order accordingly. Service is very friendly, and food comes out in 5 minutes because everything is bascially premade at the beginning of the day.",

I was appalled when I discovered a stray hair nestled on my plate. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire kitchen, and I pushed my plate away, losing all appetite.

They put at least half a pound of meat on the burger, plenty of pulled pork on the sandwich, and the wrap was loaded with fresh veggies and flavorful sauce.As I took my first bite of the burger, I couldn't help but be impressed by the juicy patty and the perfectly melted cheese. The flavors blended together beautifully, and the bun was soft and fresh. It was a mouthwatering combination. My friends seemed equally pleased with their choices. The pulled pork was tender and had a delicious smoky flavor, and the vegetarian wrap had a medley of textures and a fantastic tangy dressing. Even the loaded fries were a hit, with the crispy bacon adding a delightful crunch to each bite. All in all, our experience at the place was fantastic.

The dimly lit room, adorned with sleek, modern decor, created a cozy ambiance that made me feel like I was in some upscale joint.

I left the restaurant hungrier than when I walked in.But it wasn't just the portion sizes that left me unimpressed; the taste was nothing to write home about either.

It's the perfect dish to share with friends over a couple of cold ones.But here's the thing that really sets Bado's apart: their attention to detail. You can tell that the chefs put their heart and soul into every dish. The ingredients are fresh, the flavors are perfectly balanced, and the presentation is top-notch. It's clear that they take pride in what they serve, and it definitely shows.And let's not forget about the drinks. Bado's has a killer drink menu with a wide selection of beers on tap and creative cocktails. Whether you're in the mood for a classic IPA or a fancy concoction, they've got you covered. Plus, their bartenders know their stuff and can whip up a mean drink.The prices at Bado's are pretty reasonable too, considering the quality of the food and drinks. It won't break the bank, that's for sure. And the best part? The joint often has specials and happy hour deals that make it even more affordable.Now, I do have to mention one tiny downside. The parking situation around Bado's can be a bit tricky, especially during peak hours.",

Whenever I walk into a hardware store, I feel like a kid in a candy shop, except instead of candy, it's tools and materials that make my heart race. And let me tell you, the hardware store I visited last weekend was a total gem.As soon as I walked through the doors, I was greeted by a friendly employee who asked if I needed any help. I had a specific project in mind, so I described it to him, and he immediately led me to the aisle where I could find all the supplies I needed. The level of customer service was top-notch, and it made my shopping experience so much more enjoyable.The store was well-stocked with everything imaginable, from hammers and nails to power tools and paintbrushes. They even had a section dedicated to gardening supplies, which I couldn't resist browsing through. I ended up picking up some new trowels and gardening gloves, even though I didn't initially plan on it. There's just something about being in a hardware store that makes you want to start new projects and try your hand at different things.One thing that impressed me about this particular store was the organization. Every item had a designated spot, and the aisles were labeled clearly, making it easy to find what I was looking for. I didn't have to wander around aimlessly like I've done in some other hardware stores. It made the whole experience so much more efficient and hassle-free.Another aspect that I appreciated was the prices. I've been to hardware stores where the prices are through the roof, but this one had reasonable and competitive pricing. It made me feel like I was getting a good deal without sacrificing quality. I even noticed that they had some items on sale, which was an added bonus. Who doesn't love a good bargain, right?While I was perusing the aisles, I couldn't help but notice the camaraderie among the customers.",

As soon as I step foot into one of their greasy, crowded locations, I know I'm in for a treat. The aroma of sizzling meat and melted cheese fills the air, instantly triggering my carnivorous cravings. I throw caution to the wind and dive into their iconic sandwich piled high with juicy, tender meat, crisp coleslaw, tangy tomatoes, and of course, the stack of soft, warm fries. It's a Pittsburgh thing, they say, and it's a flavor explosion unlike anything else. The combination of flavors and textures is pure decadence, and with every messy bite, I feel a sense of guilty satisfaction wash over me. Yes, it's definitely not the healthiest choice I could make, but once a year, I allow myself this indulgence. It's a reminder to let go, embrace the guilty pleasures in life, and relish in the sheer indulgence that Primanti Bros has to offer.",

From the moment we walked into the clinic, I felt a genuine sense of compassion and expertise radiating from Dr. Dorn. The way they interacted with my furry friend was simply remarkable. Dr. Dorn took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and asked insightful questions about my dog's health history. It was evident that they truly cared about providing the best possible care for her. Not only did Dr. Dorn possess exceptional medical knowledge, but they also had a way of putting both my dog and me at ease. They had a gentle touch and a calming demeanor that made every visit stress-free. I've had experiences in the past where vets seemed rushed or disinterested, but Dr. Dorn was the complete opposite. They patiently explained each procedure, discussing the treatment options and the potential risks and benefits. Their transparency and willingness to educate pet owners set them apart.On top of their exceptional skills, the entire clinic staff was warm and welcoming. The vet assistants and receptionists always greeted us with a smile and made sure the waiting area was clean and comfortable. It's the little things that make the biggest difference, and the staff's attention to detail made me feel valued as a client.In terms of pricing, I found Dr. Dorn's clinic to be reasonable and fair. They provided clear and itemized estimates for any necessary treatments, ensuring there were no hidden costs or surprises. There was never any pressure to opt for unnecessary procedures, and they even suggested cost-effective alternatives when appropriate.Overall, I can confidently say that Dr. Dorn and their team are not just professionals, but they genuinely care about the well-being of the animals they treat. Their expertise, compassion, and dedication to providing top-notch care make them the ideal choice for anyone looking for a veterinarian. I've recommended Dr.",

It's such a relief to have a spot nearby where you can unwind and have a good laugh after a long week.

Walking into the comedy club, you're greeted with a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The dim lighting and intimate seating arrangements create an ideal setting for comedy shows. You can tell that the staff puts effort into making it a comfortable experience for the audience.The lineup of comedians they bring in is impressive. From established names to up-and-coming talents, there's always a diverse range of acts to enjoy. I've had the pleasure of attending multiple shows, and each time I've been thoroughly entertained. The performers know how to engage the crowd and deliver hilarious material.Another aspect that sets this comedy club apart is the drink selection. They offer a variety of beverages, including craft beers, specialty cocktails, and non-alcoholic options. It's refreshing to have more than just the typical bar offerings. The drinks are reasonably priced, too, which is a relief considering the inflated prices you often find at entertainment venues.One minor drawback I've noticed is that the seating can be a bit cramped. If you're a taller person or prefer more legroom, you might find yourself slightly uncomfortable. However, given the overall experience, it's a minor inconvenience that doesn't significantly detract from the enjoyment.The club's waitstaff is typically attentive and friendly. They make an effort to ensure you have everything you need throughout the show. Occasionally, though, there have been instances of delays in getting orders taken or receiving the bill. It's not a dealbreaker, but it would be nice to see improvements in that area.",

The chef here is a true master of their craft, and it shows in every bite.One of my all-time favorite dishes here is their signature dish, the \"Crispy Delight.\" Picture this: succulent chicken breast, perfectly seasoned and coated in a crispy, golden batter. It's accompanied by a medley of fresh vegetables and a side of their homemade dipping sauce that's out of this world. One bite of this divine creation, and you'll understand why I can't stop raving about it.And let's not forget about their desserts! Oh my goodness, the desserts here are to die for. From velvety chocolate cakes to creamy fruit tarts, they have something to satisfy every sweet tooth.

As soon as I walked in, memories flooded back—dimly lit ambiance, the familiar chatter of customers, and that unmistakable aroma of sizzling burgers on the grill.But let me tell you, things have changed, and not all for the better. The menu, once filled with classic favorites, now seemed like it had been taken over by a culinary kaleidoscope. Quinoa bowls, avocado toast, and gluten-free options dominated the pages. Have we forgotten the joy of pure indulgence? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for variety, but sometimes you just want good old-fashioned comfort food!Anyway, I decided to give the \"new and improved\" Max's a chance. I ordered their signature burger, hoping it would transport me back to the glorious days of savory satisfaction. Alas, what arrived on my plate was a disappointment. The patty lacked that juiciness I had come to expect. It was dry and overcooked, a far cry from the succulent perfection of days gone by.To add insult to injury, the once-generous portion of crispy french fries had been downsized to a measly handful. I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia for the heaping plates of golden goodness that Max's used to offer. The accompanying coleslaw was equally lackluster; it lacked that zing of freshness and creaminess I craved.Now, I wouldn't be a fair reviewer if I didn't mention the service. The waitstaff seemed more interested in their own conversations than taking care of customers. It took ages to get their attention, and by the time they finally took our order, my appetite had already waned.Despite my disappointment, I couldn't help but notice the bustling crowd. Clearly, there were still many who found solace in Max's offerings.",

My doubts began to fade away as soon as I saw the diverse range of dishes on the menu, blending flavors from different culinary traditions.After browsing through the enticing options, my friends and I decided to dive in and order a little bit of everything. We started off with the crispy tempura tacos, a fusion of Japanese and Mexican cuisines. The combination of the delicate tempura batter with the zesty salsa was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. It was a delightful twist on traditional tacos that left me hungry for more.Next up was the Thai-inspired spaghetti carbonara, which had me intrigued and skeptical at the same time. Could one really improve upon the classic Italian dish? Well, let me tell you, they did. The infusion of Thai spices and herbs gave the carbonara a vibrant kick, elevating it to a whole new level. Each bite was a harmonious blend of creamy richness and exotic flavors that danced on my taste buds.As our feast continued, we sampled the Korean barbecue sliders, the Indian-style sushi rolls, and even the fusion desserts like the matcha tiramisu.

The chefs at this restaurant were true culinary artists, pushing the boundaries and taking risks that paid off in the most delectable ways.Not only was the food a revelation, but the service was also impeccable.

I've been using this system for years, and it's been an absolute rollercoaster ride of frustration and inconvenience. First of all, the buses are always packed to the brim during rush hour. You'd think they would add more buses to accommodate the demand, but nope, they just keep cramming people in like sardines. It's a daily struggle to find a seat or even stand comfortably without feeling like you're part of a human sandwich. And don't even get me started on the irregular intervals between buses. One minute you're waiting for what feels like an eternity, and the next minute, two buses arrive at the same time, causing a chaotic scene of people scrambling to get on board. It's a phenomenon they call \"bus bunching,\" and let me tell you, it's enough to drive anyone insane. Plus, waiting for the bus in the freezing cold of winter is no picnic either. Standing at the stop, shivering and hoping for some relief, makes the whole commuting experience even more dreadful. To make matters worse, the Port Authority recently decided to suspend some bus services without any prior notice. Imagine my surprise when I showed up at the stop, only to find out that the bus I needed was no longer running. It's not just an inconvenience; it's a major disruption to people's daily lives. The bottom line is, while the Port Authority bus system might get attention, it's certainly not for its efficiency or customer satisfaction. I have my fingers crossed that one day they'll get their act together and improve the system for the thousands of commuters who rely on it every day.",

It looked divine, with its thin crust perfectly charred at the edges, and the vibrant red sauce artfully spread across the dough. My first bite, however, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While the crust had a nice texture, it lacked the chewiness I usually crave in a good pizza. The sauce was flavorful but leaned towards the sweeter side, which didn't quite align with my preference for a tangier, more robust taste. The cheese, though adequately melted, didn't have the gooey and stretchy quality that makes a pizza truly indulgent. As for the garlic knots, they were a mixed bag. Some were delightfully soft and packed with garlicky goodness, but others were disappointingly dry and lacking in flavor. It seemed like a hit-or-miss situation with every bite. In terms of portion size, Vincent's didn't skimp on generosity. The pizza was large enough to feed two hungry souls, and the garlic knots were plentiful.

When I first unboxed it, the sleek design and vibrant display instantly caught my attention.

The camera, for instance, takes stunning pictures, and the battery life is pretty impressive. However, I couldn't help but notice a few glitches and hiccups along the way.First off, the phone's performance felt a bit sluggish at times. It took longer than expected to switch between apps, and there were occasional lags when multitasking. It's not a deal-breaker, but it can be annoying when you're in the middle of something important.Another thing that bothered me was the lackluster speaker quality. I like to blast my favorite tunes, but the sound felt flat and lacking depth. Even at maximum volume, it didn't deliver the immersive audio experience I was hoping for. On the brighter side, the XYZ Company did improve the user interface compared to their previous models. Navigating through the menus was smooth and intuitive, and I appreciated the customizable options. Plus, the fingerprint scanner and face unlock feature worked like a charm, adding an extra layer of security.Speaking of security, let's talk about the software updates.

It's a letdown, considering the price I paid for this device.One thing I must mention is the impressive camera capabilities. The phone captures some stunning shots, especially in well-lit conditions. The colors are vibrant, and the details are sharp.",

It turned out to be a fortunate turn of events because Sushi Kim exceeded all of our expectations. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm and friendly atmosphere that instantly made us feel welcome.The menu at Sushi Kim offers an extensive selection of sushi rolls, sashimi, and other Japanese specialties. We decided to start with the miso soup and seaweed salad, which were both delicious. The miso soup had a rich, savory flavor that was comforting on a chilly day, while the seaweed salad was fresh and tangy, with just the right amount of crunch.For our main course, we ordered an assortment of sushi rolls. The presentation of each dish was a feast for the eyes—the vibrant colors and meticulous arrangement showcased the chef's attention to detail. Every bite was a burst of flavors, with a perfect balance of ingredients. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the rice was just the right consistency—not too sticky and not too dry.What impressed us most was the skill of the sushi chef. We were lucky enough to sit at the sushi bar and watch as he expertly crafted each roll with precision and finesse. It was evident that he took great pride in his work, and that passion translated into the wonderful dining experience we had.The service at Sushi Kim was top-notch, with attentive waitstaff who were knowledgeable about the menu and happy to make recommendations. They ensured that our glasses were never empty and checked in on us regularly, without being overbearing. We felt well taken care of throughout our meal.Overall, Sushi Kim turned out to be a delightful surprise. It's a gem of a restaurant tucked away in the area, and we're glad we stumbled upon it. The combination of flavors, the artistry in presentation, and the friendly ambiance made it a memorable dining experience for our family.",

The sunlight streaming through the glass created a warm and inviting ambiance.As we perused the menu, I couldn't help but notice the variety of options available. They had everything from classic comfort food to innovative culinary creations. After much deliberation, I settled on their signature cheeseburger, while my friend opted for the veggie wrap. We also ordered a side of their famous sweet potato fries because, well, who can resist those?The wait for our food seemed endless, but it was definitely worth it. When our meals finally arrived, they looked like works of art on the plates. The cheeseburger was perfectly cooked, with the cheese oozing out and the toppings stacked high. One bite, and I was in burger heaven. The patty was juicy, the bun super fresh, and the flavors melded together in the most mouthwatering way.Meanwhile, my friend's veggie wrap was a colorful medley of fresh vegetables, bursting with flavor and wrapped in a soft tortilla. Even as a meat lover, I couldn't help but steal a bite, and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. The accompanying sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned to perfection.Throughout our meal, the staff checked on us regularly, making sure we had everything we needed.

It's like a treasure trove of hidden gems, just waiting to be discovered. The moment I step through those doors, I can feel the thrill of anticipation coursing through my veins. The smell of old books mixed with a hint of mustiness, the sight of racks overflowing with clothing from decades past - it's like stepping into a time capsule.What sets this thrift store apart from the rest is not only the incredible selection but also the prices. I mean, where else can you find a designer dress for a fraction of the original cost? The deals here are out of this world, and it's not just limited to clothing. You can find everything from furniture to kitchenware to vintage vinyl records. It's a paradise for anyone with an eye for unique and affordable finds.The staff is always friendly and helpful, too. They genuinely seem to enjoy what they do and are willing to go the extra mile to assist you in your search. Whether you need help finding a specific item or want recommendations based on your style, they've got you covered. They even organize special events and sales, making the whole thrift store experience even more exciting.One of the things I adore about this thrift store is that they support local charities. Every purchase I make here feels like a small contribution towards making a difference in my community. It's a win-win situation - I get incredible items at unbeatable prices while knowing that my money is going towards a good cause.I have to admit, though, that with the store's growing popularity, it has become a bit busier lately. Sometimes, finding a parking spot can be a challenge, and the checkout lines can get a tad long. But honestly, that's a small price to pay for the incredible treasures I unearth on each visit.",

The park itself is massive, no doubt about that. Water slides and pools everywhere you look! But the first thing that struck me was the long lines. I mean, seriously, I've never seen queues this long in my life. It felt like we spent more time waiting than actually enjoying the rides. Not cool, Sandcastle, not cool at all.And speaking of the rides, they were a bit underwhelming. I tried a few of the big ones, like the Thunder Run and the Blue Tubular Twister, but they didn't really get my adrenaline pumping. I felt like they were missing that thrill factor, you know? Maybe I've been to too many water parks, but these rides just didn't live up to my expectations.On the positive side, they had a decent lazy river. It was nice to kick back and relax while floating along the gentle current. The wave pool was also fun, although it got way too crowded later in the day. People were practically on top of each other, and let me tell you, that's not my idea of a good time. Plus, finding a free lounge chair was like finding a needle in a haystack. Every spot seemed to be taken, and it ended up being a real struggle to find a place to chill out and soak up some sun.The food options were lackluster as well. I was hoping for some tasty snacks or a decent meal, but all they had were overpriced hot dogs and soggy fries. I mean, come on, Sandcastle, you can do better than that! And don't even get me started on the prices. Everything was way too expensive, from the admission tickets to the lockers and even the parking. It felt like they were just trying to squeeze every penny out of us.To be fair, there were some highlights. The staff was friendly and helpful, despite the chaos around them. They did their best to keep things running smoothly and ensure everyone was having a good time.",

The bun was soft and perfectly toasted, holding everything together without falling apart.As I savored the delicious flavors, I couldn't help but notice the attention to detail in the presentation. The burger was accompanied by a generous portion of golden fries, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of salt. The plate itself was artfully arranged, with a sprinkle of fresh herbs and a drizzle of their secret sauce that added an extra depth of flavor.The service throughout my meal was impeccable. The staff checked on me regularly, refilling my water glass and ensuring I had everything I needed.

I ended up finding a vintage leather jacket that fit me like a glove, and I couldn't wait to show it off to my friends.Besides the clothing section, they also had a diverse selection of furniture, home decor, and even vinyl records. It was a haven for those who appreciate vintage aesthetics and want to add a touch of nostalgia to their homes. I ended up snagging a retro record player and a few classic vinyl albums that I had been searching for ages.To top it all off, the store had a charming little café in the corner.

The bright orange signage, towering aisles, and bustling shoppers all had a striking resemblance to the other locations I've visited in the past. It's as if they have a template that they follow religiously, leaving little room for uniqueness or character.Now, don't get me wrong, I appreciate consistency and knowing what to expect when I enter a chain store like this. But after visiting multiple Home Depots, it's hard not to feel a sense of monotony creeping in. It's as if they're playing it safe and sticking to a formula rather than striving for innovation or an enhanced customer experience.One thing that stood out to me, though, was the lack of staff presence. It's no secret that these stores can get incredibly busy, especially during weekends and peak hours. But it's disheartening when you're struggling to find assistance in a sea of merchandise. I must have wandered around aimlessly for what felt like ages before finally spotting an employee who seemed more interested in chatting with a colleague than helping customers.And the prices! Oh boy, don't even get me started. I understand that Home Depot is a reputable brand, and quality comes at a cost. However, it often feels like they take advantage of their market dominance by inflating prices. I found myself consistently questioning whether the premium I was paying was truly justified or if I could find the same items for a better deal elsewhere.Perhaps my biggest gripe, though, is the lack of attention to detail. Sure, the shelves are stocked, and everything is neatly organized, but there's an element of soullessness. It's as if the store exists solely for its utilitarian purpose rather than creating a pleasant and inviting atmosphere.",

Let me share with you the nightmare I went through when I made the mistake of pre-paying for a service that turned out to be a complete disaster. So, there I was, all excited and ready to get this service done. I had heard good things about the company, and their website looked professional enough. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a journey filled with frustration and regret. The first sign of trouble came when I arrived at the location on the scheduled day.

Oh boy, I was in for a rude awakening. As soon as I mentioned that I had pre-paid, their attitude changed completely. It was like I had just insulted their ancestors or something. The staff member at the counter gave me a condescending look and mumbled something under their breath. I couldn't believe it. I was treated like I didn't matter, like my business wasn't important to them. But I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded with the service. Big mistake. The whole process was a disaster from start to finish. The staff members seemed completely clueless about what they were doing. They were fumbling around, making mistakes left and right, and had to keep calling for help. It was amateur hour at its finest. Not only was the service itself subpar, but the level of customer service I received was atrocious. The staff members were rude and dismissive, as if they couldn't be bothered to deal with my concerns. It was like they were doing me a favor by providing their so-called \"service.\" At one point, I asked to speak to a manager to express my frustration. What a joke that was.

I remember the countless times I wandered through those aisles, searching for hidden treasures and stumbling upon unexpected bargains. Kmart holds a special place in my heart, a relic of days gone by when department stores were the epicenter of shopping adventures.Well, I have to admit, Kmart has seen better days. The fluorescent lights overhead are dimmer now, casting a slightly melancholic atmosphere upon the once vibrant store. There's a nostalgic charm to the worn-out carpets and the creaking shopping carts, though it's a bittersweet reminder of the changing retail landscape.It's no secret that Kmart faces fierce competition from online retailers and sleek, modern stores. Yet, despite its faded glory, there's still something undeniably endearing about the place. The friendly staff, clad in their retro blue vests, greet you with a warm smile and an air of resilience.While the shelves may not be as fully stocked as they once were, Kmart still manages to surprise. Every now and then, you stumble upon a gem amidst the clearance racks—a forgotten board game or a childhood favorite toy. It's like unearthing buried treasure, a moment of pure delight.Sure, the layout might be a bit haphazard and the aisles could use some tidying up, but Kmart has an authenticity that modern chain stores often lack. It's a reminder of simpler times, where shopping was an adventure and not just a task to be checked off the to-do list.Then there's the unmistakable scent that wafts through the air—a unique mixture of new merchandise, cleaning products, and a hint of nostalgia.

The charming ambiance, the authentic decor, and the heavenly aroma of sausages sizzling on the grill instantly transport me back to the delightful Bavarian streets. However, it's worth mentioning that the restaurant's location can sometimes be a double-edged sword. Being right near the hospital means the surroundings can get a bit busy and chaotic, especially during peak hours. The constant sound of ambulance sirens whizzing by and the occasional hustle and bustle of health professionals rushing in and out of the hospital can be a little distracting. But let's not dwell on the negatives because the food here more than makes up for any minor inconveniences. Every dish I've tried has been an absolute treat for my taste buds. From their mouthwatering schnitzels to their delectable pretzels, the chefs at this place clearly know how to capture the essence of German cuisine. The portions are generous, ensuring you leave with a happy and satisfied tummy.The staff here are also incredibly friendly and attentive. They always greet me with a warm smile and go out of their way to ensure my dining experience is enjoyable. One time, I had a special request for a vegetarian version of a traditional German dish, and they gladly accommodated it without compromising on taste or quality. It's this level of personalized service that sets this restaurant apart.In addition to the delightful food and outstanding service, the prices here are surprisingly reasonable. Considering the quality and authenticity of the cuisine, you'd expect to pay a premium, but this place manages to strike the perfect balance between value and taste. It's refreshing to find a restaurant that offers such a memorable dining experience without breaking the bank.Overall, despite its proximity to the hospital, this German restaurant has become my go-to place whenever I crave a taste of Germany.",

I walked into this charming little trattoria expecting nothing more than a good meal, but what I got was an experience straight out of the streets of Italy. As soon as I stepped through the door, the aroma of garlic, tomatoes, and fresh herbs enveloped me, instantly transporting me to the heart of Rome. The warm, rustic decor added to the ambience, with exposed brick walls adorned with old black-and-white photographs of Italian landmarks.The menu was a delight for any Italian food lover. From classic pasta dishes to mouthwatering antipasti platters, they had it all. I decided to start with the bruschetta, and oh boy, it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. The toasted bread topped with juicy tomatoes, fragrant basil, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil was the perfect appetizer to awaken my taste buds.For the main course, I ordered the lasagna, a dish that holds a special place in my heart. The layers of perfectly cooked pasta, rich meat sauce, and creamy béchamel melted together harmoniously, creating a symphony of flavors. Each bite was a comforting hug that reminded me of my Italian grandmother's cooking.The service was impeccable, with the waitstaff attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They took the time to explain each dish, making recommendations based on personal preferences. Their passion for authentic Italian cuisine was evident in the way they spoke about the ingredients and the cooking techniques.As I savored every bite, I couldn't help but appreciate the attention to detail that went into each dish. The pasta was cooked al dente, just like it should be, and the sauces were perfectly balanced, allowing the flavors to shine. It was evident that the chefs in the kitchen knew what they were doing and had a deep understanding of Italian culinary traditions.To end the meal on a sweet note, I indulged in a classic tiramisu.",

I mean, seriously, you walk in, and it's like a tornado hit the place. Tables scattered with dirty dishes, chairs pushed all over, and don't even get me started on the floor. It's like they haven't heard of a broom or a mop in ages.And let's talk about the service. It's a hit or miss, more like a miss most of the time. I've encountered some of the shittiest baristas here. They don't seem to care much about their job or the customers. They're either too busy chatting with their coworkers or just staring into space like they're in some kind of coffee-induced trance.But hey, I'm not one to judge based solely on appearances, right? So, I give it a shot, order my usual black coffee with a shot of espresso, hoping that at least the coffee will be decent. Well, I couldn't be more disappointed. The coffee tastes like it's been sitting there for hours, burnt and bitter, leaving a nasty aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for hours. It's like they don't know how to make a proper cup of joe.Oh, and don't even think about finding a place to sit. The few available seats are usually occupied by people glued to their laptops, hogging the space for hours on end. It's as if this place has become a free coworking space instead of a café. How am I supposed to enjoy my coffee when I'm standing like a lost soul, desperately trying to find a spot?To top it all off, the prices are way too high for the subpar experience you get. I'm not one to count every penny, but c'mon, it's like they're robbing you blind. For that kind of money, I expect exceptional coffee and service, not this disappointing circus.In conclusion, this location may have its convenient proximity to my workplace, but the overall experience is far from satisfactory.",

As soon as we entered, we were greeted by the warm and inviting ambiance. The dim lighting and soft music created an intimate atmosphere, perfect for a special occasion.We started with the chef's recommended appetizer, the Mediterranean platter. It was a delightful assortment of hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, and stuffed grape leaves. Each bite was bursting with flavor, and the freshness of the ingredients was evident. The presentation was impeccable, with vibrant colors and a beautiful arrangement on the plate.For our main course, my husband ordered the lamb shank with rosemary-infused jus, while I opted for the grilled sea bass with lemon caper sauce. The lamb shank was tender and succulent, falling off the bone with a rich and savory taste. The sea bass was perfectly grilled, retaining its moistness, and the tanginess of the lemon caper sauce complemented the delicate flavor of the fish.The service throughout the evening was attentive and friendly. Our server, Sarah, was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. She took the time to explain each dish and even shared some interesting tidbits about the restaurant's history. We felt well taken care of and appreciated the personal touch.As the evening progressed, a small incident occurred that slightly disrupted our experience. There was a fire at the neighboring table, which resulted in a momentary panic. However, the staff handled the situation swiftly and professionally, ensuring everyone's safety. Although it was an unfortunate occurrence, the way the staff addressed the issue was commendable.Moving on to desserts, we couldn't resist trying the baklava and the chocolate lava cake. The baklava was flaky and sweet, with just the right amount of honey syrup.",

As I entered, the aroma of cooked spices instantly enveloped me, making my mouth water in anticipation. The restaurant had a cozy ambiance with dim lighting and soft music playing in the background, creating a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.I was greeted by a friendly waiter who escorted me to my table. I glanced through the menu, overwhelmed by the variety of options available. After much contemplation, I settled on their signature dish, a sizzling plate of steak with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.The wait for my order seemed to stretch on forever, and my hunger intensified with each passing minute. Finally, the moment arrived as the waiter placed the sizzling plate in front of me. The aroma was irresistible, and I couldn't wait to dig in.However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment as I cut into the steak. It was overcooked and lacked the tenderness I had hoped for. The garlic mashed potatoes, which had promised creamy deliciousness, fell short on flavor and were bland. I took a few bites, but the taste left much to be desired.I signaled the waiter, hoping to address my concerns. Unfortunately, the response I got was far from satisfactory. The waiter seemed dismissive and uninterested in resolving my issue. I felt disrespected as a customer who had come with high expectations.In the end, the experience left me feeling frustrated and unhappy. It was such a letdown considering the restaurant's reputation and the hype around their dishes. I had made the effort to visit based on rave reviews, but it turned out to be a regrettable decision. Needless to say, I won't be going back, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a world-class dining experience.WTF? It's a shame when a restaurant fails to meet expectations, especially when you've been looking forward to it. The whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth.",

I looked at my friend, hoping it was just a momentary thing, but the smell seemed to follow us to our table. Ignoring the odor, we bravely decided to start with the appetizers. I ordered the calamari, hoping for crispy, golden rings of deliciousness. Sadly, what arrived at our table was a disappointment. The calamari was rubbery and seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long.Now, I don't mean to sound too negative, but the main course didn't fare much better. I opted for their signature dish, the \"Sizzling Beef Platter.\" The menu described it as tender beef strips, sautéed with colorful veggies in a savory sauce. However, what came out sizzling on the platter was a sad assortment of tough meat and overcooked vegetables. The beef resembled shoe leather, and the veggies had lost all their vibrant colors and crispness.Our server, bless his heart, tried his best to salvage the experience. He was genuinely kind and polite, but unfortunately, the kitchen's shortcomings were beyond his control. Even the presentation of the dishes seemed lackluster, with sloppy plating and a messy drizzle of sauce that did little to enhance the overall appearance.As we pushed through the mediocre meal, we couldn't help but notice the lack of attention from the staff. Our water glasses remained unfilled for most of the evening, and it took an excruciatingly long time to get their attention when we needed something. It felt as though they were understaffed, struggling to keep up with the busy evening crowd. To top it all off, when we finally made it to the dessert stage, the options were disappointingly limited. It seemed like they had run out of ideas or perhaps didn't prioritize that part of the menu. We settled for a generic slice of chocolate cake, but even that failed to impress.",

I swear, I could almost hear my taste buds singing \"Hallelujah!\" with each heavenly bite. And did I mention the portions? They were generous enough to feed a small army. I practically had to waddle out of there after my meal, struggling to button up my jeans. But you know what? It was totally worth it. To top it all off, the ambiance of the place was simply perfect.

The music playing in the background set the mood just right, and I couldn't help but tap my foot along with the catchy tunes.

The plate arrived, and I was in awe of the presentation. Each taco was beautifully assembled with generous portions of fillings and toppings. I couldn't wait to dig in!The first bite was a burst of flavors in my mouth. The marinated carne asada was tender and packed with smoky deliciousness. The grilled shrimp taco had a delightful hint of lime and a slight kick of spice. The vegetarian option, loaded with grilled veggies and creamy guacamole, was a refreshing change. Every taco had its distinct personality and left me craving for more.To accompany my tacos, I ordered a side of their homemade salsa and guacamole. The salsa had just the right amount of heat and tanginess, while the guacamole was creamy and packed with fresh avocado goodness. I couldn't resist scooping up every last bit with their crispy tortilla chips.However, I must admit that the service was a bit slow. It took quite some time for the staff to take my order, and there were moments when I had to wait for a refill on my drink. Nevertheless, the friendly and apologetic attitude of the staff made up for the delay.In terms of price, the tacos were reasonably priced considering the quality and portion sizes. However, I would have liked to see more vegetarian options on the menu to cater to a wider range of diners.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the taco stand. The flavors, atmosphere, and attention to detail in their dishes made it a memorable experience.",

As I entered the coffee shop, the smell of freshly brewed beans instantly enveloped me, enticing my senses and building up my anticipation. The place had a laid-back atmosphere, with comfy couches and wooden tables scattered across the room. Soft indie music played in the background, creating a chill vibe that I couldn't help but appreciate.However, as I approached the counter, the barista seemed a bit distracted, juggling multiple orders and not taking the time to engage with customers. It was a bit disappointing to not receive a warm welcome, especially considering the reputation this place had among coffee enthusiasts.Nonetheless, I ordered my usual cappuccino and found a cozy corner to settle in. The first sip revealed a beautifully crafted foam art atop a smooth and velvety espresso. The taste was rich and satisfying, with just the right balance of bitterness and creaminess. It was evident that the barista had skillfully dialed in the espresso machine for a perfect shot.However, as I continued sipping my coffee, I couldn't help but notice that the Wi-Fi connection was spotty at best. It was frustrating, as I had hoped to catch up on some work while enjoying my drink. I admit that this soured me a bit, as the availability of reliable Wi-Fi is something I consider essential, especially in a coffee shop marketed as a place to work and relax.Despite that setback, the overall ambiance and the quality of their espresso made the visit worthwhile. The coffee shop had a unique charm, with its rustic interior and friendly chatter from other customers. It was an ideal spot for meeting with friends or having a casual date, as the vibe lent itself to relaxed conversations.",

Packed with tender, slow-cooked pork, flavorful black beans, and a perfect blend of spices, every bite was a burst of deliciousness. The tortilla was perfectly toasted, adding a satisfying crunch to the already heavenly combination of flavors.To accompany our meal, we ordered a round of their famous margaritas. Sarah informed us that they freshly squeeze their citrus juices daily for the most refreshing experience. She wasn't kidding! Those margaritas were like sipping a slice of paradise.

The place was bustling with locals and tourists, creating a lively atmosphere that added to our anticipation. As we perused the menu, we couldn't help but notice the sheer size of the sandwiches. They were unlike anything we had seen before, towering with mountains of coleslaw and fries stuffed between thick slices of Italian bread. Impressed by the reputation, we decided to try their famous \"Pitts-Burger\" and a classic pastrami sandwich. The service was friendly and attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive.However, as we took the first bite of the Pitts-Burger, we were slightly disappointed. While the meat was well-cooked and flavorful, the excessive amount of slaw and fries overwhelmed the overall taste. The coleslaw had a tangy flavor, but it dominated the sandwich, leaving little room for the other ingredients to shine. The fries, although crispy, became soggy due to the combination of condiments. It felt more like eating a coleslaw and fry sandwich with a hint of burger rather than a well-balanced burger.Moving on to the pastrami sandwich, we hoped it would redeem our dining experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations as well. The pastrami lacked the tenderness and bold flavors we've come to love in a classic deli sandwich. The bread, although fresh, couldn't make up for the underwhelming fillings. We were left craving more complexity and depth in the tastes.On the positive side, the restaurant's ambiance and history added charm to our visit. The walls were adorned with sports memorabilia and photographs, showcasing the local pride and strong community spirit. We appreciated the genuine Pittsburgh vibe that surrounded us.In conclusion, while Primanti Bros has a rich history and a unique concept, our experience fell short of the hype.",

They were absolutely indulgent and disappeared within minutes.For the main course, I couldn't resist trying their signature burger. It came highly recommended by friends, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The patty was a bit overcooked, resulting in a dry and lackluster experience.

They were perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of crispiness.But it wasn't just about the food at Olive or Twist; the drinks were equally impressive.

I'm really disappointed with the way they've handled this situation.I understand that things can sometimes go wrong, but it's how a company deals with those problems that really matters. In this case, the company has done nothing to resolve the issue or even acknowledge my concerns. It's clear that they don't care about their customers.I'm writing this review to warn other people about this company. If you're thinking of buying a product from them, I urge you to reconsider. You'll likely regret it if you do.There are plenty of other companies out there that offer similar products with much better customer service.

I had to wait over 30 minutes for my food, and it was cold when it finally arrived. The manager didn't seem to care at all when I complained, and he refused to offer me a refund. To make matters worse, the restaurant was filthy, and the tables were covered in dirty dishes. I would strongly advise you to avoid this place at all costs.

However, if the lunch lady had dished up Frank's famous pulled pork sandwich, sloppy joes, or mac and cheese instead of mystery meat, tater tots, and creamed peas, I would have run to the cafeteria instead of hiding under my desk every time I heard it.Upon entering Frank's Eats, you are immediately greeted by 50's kitsch, which is the diner's theme. I'm not sure why they went with that theme, though, since the food is pure 90's Sysco slop. But if you're looking for a hearty meal that will stick to your ribs and make you feel like you're in a time warp, Frank's Eats is the place to go.One of my favorite things about Frank's Eats is the extensive menu. They have everything from burgers and fries to chicken parmesan to liver and onions. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can try one of their signature dishes, like the Garbage Plate or the Texas Tornado. Just be prepared for a gut bomb that will leave you feeling like you need a nap.Despite the delicious food, there are a few things that could be improved at Frank's Eats. The service can be slow at times, and the prices are a bit high.

The food is just average, not bad but nothing to rave about. It is just your typical run of the mill chips and salsa. Service is good but very slow. We ordered our food and it did take a long time to come out. We ordered the chimichanga and it was ok but not the best. I ordered two cheese enchiladas. My meal was supposed to come with rice and beans. When it arrived, I noticed it did not have the sides, so I asked and the waiter said he would bring them but he never did. My husband really enjoyed the chimichanga and said it was some of the best he had ever eaten.  I tried it and it was pretty good but I thought it was a little bland and needed more seasoning.  The sides were ok.  The refried beans were runny and the rice was a little undercooked. The only thing I really enjoyed about my meal was the guacamole. The serving size was pretty big.

It's repetitive, annoying, and completely forgettable. I literally had to turn it off after a few minutes because it was driving me crazy.But the worst part of this game is the controls. They're so clunky and unresponsive that it's almost impossible to play. I found myself getting killed over and over again simply because I couldn't move my character out of the way of danger in time.I could go on and on about how bad this game is, but I'll spare you the details. Suffice it to say, I would not recommend this game to anyone. Save your money and go to Spaghetti Warehouse instead. You'll have a much better time.",

After devouring an entire book about the behind-the-scenes happenings at NPR, I’m afraid I’ve become a bit obsessed. In a good way. I can’t get enough. NPR has inspired me to think bigger. It’s given me ideas that I wouldn’t have otherwise considered. My dream is to one day have the opportunity to sit on that hallowed stage, to be interviewed by Terry Gross or Ira Glass. I’ve listened to so many hours of Fresh Air and This American Life, my ears are permanently perked, waiting for the dulcet tones of those dulcet voices. I’m not sure why I’m so drawn to NPR. Maybe it’s the intelligent conversation, the thought-provoking stories, or the simple fact that it makes me feel like I’m part of something bigger than myself. NPR’s storytelling has power. It has the ability to transport me to other worlds, to introduce me to new ideas, and to make me feel connected to the human experience. It’s the perfect antidote to the cynicism that can sometimes creep into my life. Whenever I’m feeling down, I can always count on NPR to lift me up. It’s a reliable source of positivity and inspiration. And it’s always there for me, no matter what.",

We've been going there for years and have always enjoyed the food and service. However, our last experience there was so disappointing that we will never be going back.The service was the worst we've ever had at this restaurant. Our server seemed disinterested and inattentive. He took our drink orders and then disappeared for over 15 minutes. When he finally came back with our drinks, he got them wrong. He also forgot to bring us menus. After we finally got our menus, it took another 20 minutes for him to come back and take our food order.The food was just as bad as the service. The hibachi chicken was overcooked and dry, the vegetables were bland and tasted like they had been sitting out for far too long, and the rice was gummy. The only thing that was good was the yum yum sauce.To make matters worse, the restaurant was dirty. The floors were sticky and the tables were covered in crumbs. The bathrooms were also disgusting.Overall, our experience at this restaurant was absolutely unacceptable. We will never be going back. I don't know how people keep coming here. If you're looking for a good hibachi restaurant, I suggest you look elsewhere.",

I usually just take my food to go since the indoor seating is usually full by the dinner rush.  The jambalaya is incredible, packed full of shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage. I know some people find it too spicy but it's just right for my taste. The gumbo is rich and hearty too, perfect for dipping that homemade bread into. Oh man, that bread - it's soft and doughy on the inside with a nice crusty top. Definitely fill up on it before your meal gets to the table.   I highly recommend the po'boys if you're looking for a sandwich. The roast beef one is my favorite, piled high with juicy meat and crisp veggies. Be sure to get some of their homemade pickled veggies on the side too, a nice tangy complement. Prices are super reasonable for the quality and portion sizes you get.

We started out checking out the science demos in the main hall. The kids totally loved the hovercraft exhibit and had to try like 5 times to get the ones shaped like discs to float. Then we headed up to the weather room to catch a storm simulation. It was crazy loud in there with the thunder and lightning! Up next was the invention station where the kids spent forever trying to build the tallest tower out of spaghetti and marshmallows. After that we checked out the nature exhibit downstairs. The butterfly room was beautiful but kinda smelled funny since it was like hundreds of butterflies in there. We tried to find all the different species but a lot of them just looked the same to me. For lunch we ate in the cafe and it wasn't too expensive considering it was a museum. The pizza wasn't amazing but it hit the spot since we'd been walking around for a couple hours already. In the afternoon we went to the IMAX theater to see the new ocean documentary. The visuals on the huge screen were breathtaking! On our way out we spent some time in the playground outside. The kids played til they were exhausted and had to practically be dragged to the car. Overall it was a really fun day and the museum had lots of hands-on activities to keep everyone engaged.

The first time was about 5 years ago for a gaming conference. It was a Friday afternoon and the traffic getting there was a nightmare. Seemed like every road around the airport was backed up. Took us over 2 hours just to go 10 miles. Never again will I try to drive that route on a weekend! The second time I came was last year for a comic book convention. Flew in on a Tuesday so didn't have to deal with weekend traffic thank goodness. Got an Uber from the airport to the hotel which went much smoother. Checked into my room and rested for a bit before heading to the convention center. Didn't realize how massive the place was until I was actually inside it. Spent the whole afternoon checking out all the exhibitor booths.  Had dinner plans that night with some friends also in town for the con. We ended up at some food hall place in the airport, can't remember the name. Service was pretty slow but the food was decent. Talking and people watching made the time pass. Wed morning woke up and did it all again at the con. So many cool panels and events to choose from, it was hard to pick! Took a lunch break in the airport atrium area, was really nice sitting outside.  Late afternoon my flight got delayed of course. They said 3 hours but ended up being over 5 thanks to a storm. I was ready to pull my hair out by then from boredom! Finally boarded and took off just before sunset. Touchdown in Charlotte only to sit on the runway for another hour. Not the smoothest trip home but the convention itself was a blast as always. Next time though I'll try to avoid traveling on a weekend if possible. Too much hassle!",

On Fridays and Saturdays after 10pm, the late night DJ spins some serious throwback jams that had me transported back in the 80s on the dance floor - reliving my glory hammer dance days in all their defunct glory. The brightly colored humongo rubik's cubes and lava lamps lining the walls added to the totally rad retro vibe. Between trying not to spill my gin and tonic on my already ghastly uncomfortable heels, I noticed nearly every table was packed with pairs and groups getting their boogie on. By midnight, the place was jumping with so many bodies on the dance floor it felt like a gross invasion of my personal space. While the American fare is nothing to write home about, I wasn't there for the food - I was there to let myself go and test out those dance moves that you secretly practice in front of the mirror at home. With drink specials and a lively DJ, Cosmos is a fun care-free weekend spot to cut loose with friends without taking yourself too seriously. Just be prepared to bump, grind and spill a drink or two in the process!",

My chicken was a little dry and my friend said her pasta was kinda bland. The service was pretty slow too. We sat forever just trying to get someone to refill our water. The atmosphere inside was pretty depressing if I'm being honest. It was dimly lit and all the decor was really dark and dreary. Didn't feel very welcoming at all. Also, it was dead quiet in there - I think we were probably the only ones eating since it was a Tuesday night. The music they had playing was kinda strange too. Sounded like it was from some sad indie movie or something. The couple sitting next to us didn't look too happy either. I overheard the wife say something about how she wished they'd gone somewhere else. Can't say I blame her after experiencing the place myself! The server was nice enough but she looked bored out of her mind. After we finally got the check, I took a look in the bathroom before we left. Big mistake! It was disgusting in there. Made the whole place feel even more depressing if that's possible. At the end of the day, I'd say save your money and energy for any of the other cool restaurants around here. This place just left me feeling kind of blah and I wasn't sad to leave at all. Definitely wouldn't come back or recommend it to others looking for something new to check out.",

A few of us debated just going to IHOP instead since we were starving but we decided to stick it out. The hostess told us the wait would be long and we groaned but knew Mert's was worth it. Alyssa pulled up their menu on her phone to look at all the brunch options while we waited. I really needed some coffee to recharge so I was hoping they had some good brews. Thankfully the time went by pretty fast as we chatted and looked around the restaurant. It had a cool vintage diner vibe with cool neon signs and retro details. Finally our table was ready and a server led us to a booth in the back. We all ordered way too much food, like stacks of pancakes, omelettes, waffles and sides to share. The food came out pretty fast considering how busy it was. Everything was so delicious and filling, definitely hitting the spot after our long walk. I ended up taking half my meal home in a to-go box since I was so stuffed. We lingered as long as we could chatting before we had to head out.

I got seated quickly at a little two top near the window. The menu had a lot of options so it took me a while to decide. I finally settled on the chicken karaage and ginger shiitake ramen. The chicken was crispy and flavorful, definitely hit the spot. The broth in the ramen was rich and creamy without being too heavy. While I was waiting for my food, I watched the activity on the street and people watched out the big window. The server was really attentive, she refilled my water without me asking. The portion sizes were pretty generous which I appreciated. Overall I thought the food and service were solid for the price. However, it was pretty noisy in there with all the other customers.

Inside it was dimly lit and playing old jazz music. It had a really cozy, intimate feel. We snagged a small table in the corner and looked over the menu. Everything sounded so delicious, it was hard to choose! The waitress came over, an older, friendly lady who had worked there for years. She gave us some suggestions on what was popular and made us all feel at ease. I decided to go for the chicken pot pie, figuring it was a safe bet. When our food arrived, it looked and smelled incredible. I took my first bite and was in heaven - the pastry was buttery and flaky, and the filling was so rich and savory. My friends all agreed their dishes were perfect too. We chatted and laughed while enjoying our meals. A few other groups were there, mostly older couples, but the vibe was relaxed. After we finished eating, we all quietly agreed we had found our new favorite spot. The bill came and we were shocked at how reasonable it was for such large portions of such high quality food. As we left, the waitress wished us a good night. I'm sure we'll be back here often from now on and can't wait to introduce more of our friends to this hidden gem.

All the appliances looked like they hadn't been replaced since the 1980s. The first maintenance request took over 10 days to get addressed since they clearly do not train their staff properly. You'd think keeping the heat working in the dead of winter would be a priority but I guess not for these clowns. We put up with it since moving in the middle of winter sucked but man were those cunts annoying to deal with.Come spring, the water leaks in the ceiling started. I'm pretty sure we had mold growing up there but good luck getting them to actually fix anything in a timely manner. A few months later the oven broke which resulted in many pizza delivery dinners. The rent was already a bit steep for the quality of the place but all the constant issues with the apartment and complex just made living there miserable. When our lease was up at the end of the year, you can bet we got out of there as fast as possible. I'd still be freezing my ass off with black mold if I had stayed any longer.

As I checked out the girl at the register was super nice and chatty, asking what kinda books I liked. We ended up gabbing for a few minutes about favorite authors and series.The coffee/tea bar in the back of the shop was a nice bonus. I treated myself to an iced americano before heading back out into the Charlotte heat. Overall it was the perfect low key spot to spend a relaxing hour or two flipping through pages.

The bartender, Brian, seemed like a nice enough guy though and was quick with refills. To eat, I got the chicken wings which were alright but a little over-sauced in my opinion.

When our food finally came out, the group had only gotten louder and rowdier. I could barely hear Jenny across the table trying to tell me about her day over their drunken hooting. The wings were alright but I was honestly just kinda over it at that point. We tried to quickly polish off our snacks so we could ditch that scene.

I treated us both to a scone to enjoy while catching up on each others lives.After chatting for a bit and finishing our snacks, we browsed around the books a little more. I'm not sure what drew her to it but she started flipping through some binder of comprehension quizzes. When I glanced over, she had been caught exploding unnecessarily on some punishment quiz! I couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculous scenario she had found herself in. All in all it was a fun afternoon spent at Barnes and Noble. I always leave feeling happy and inspired, which is why they'll always be one of my favorite stores.",

As I drove down the long road heading towards the terminal, lush palm trees and Spanish moss-covered live oaks lined the way, hinting at the charming lowcountry landscape that awaited. Upon arrival, I was struck by the airport's small, intimate size - only two gates served the whole operation. However, what it lacked in size, it made up for with southern hospitality. The staff was exceedingly friendly and warmly welcomed visitors to their tiny airfield. After parking, I took a walk around the perimeter to soak in the scenery. Off in the distance, wide saltmarshlands met the sky, with the blue Atlantic just beyond. As the breezes caressed my face, I could taste the salt on my lips and hear calls of seabirds riding coastal currents. It was the perfect picture of peaceful solitude, a world away from the bustle of major hub airports. I whiled away a relaxing hour, soaking in the serenity before it was time to embark on my return flight. It was a picturesque departure that I'll long remember with fondness for the charm of Carolina's small community airports.",

As soon as we walked in I was like \"wow this place is adorable!\" with its exposed brick and string lights everywhere. We snagged a table right away which was good because it was getting pretty crowded in there. Janet and I both got a personal pizza each and split an appetizer of the bruschetta - totally on point by the way. I got the margherita pizza which was heaped with the good stuff - fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. It was delish! Janet got the veggie pizza and we both agreed hers looked bomb too.

On top of that, my server had a real attitude problem and clearly did not want to be there. I couldn't finish the sad plate of pasta and just asked for the check after 10 minutes. At that point I just wanted to find somewhere, anywhere else to eat. The whole experience left me wondering why this place is still in business and really wishing I had Yelped it first.

Our party of four decided to dine at Upstream on a weekday evening hoping to avoid some of the busy weekend crowds. We were warmly greeted at the entrance by the host and showed to our table, a lovely booth tucked away in a cozy corner, giving our meal a intimate ambiance. The restaurant had a lively yet relaxing atmosphere, with just the right volume of quiet jazz playing over the speakers, creating a harmonious symphony to enjoy our food to. Our server came over with menus and was friendly and knowledgeable, giving us recommendations based on our tastes. I opted for the seafood paella, knowing Upstream has a deft hand with rice dishes, while my partner chose the salmon pasta hoping for a light yet fulfilling meal. The appetizers we started with did not disappoint - the grilled calamari had tender squid tubes and a delightful lemon caper aioli for dipping. A shared plate of bruschetta featured a beautifully composed arrangement of vine ripe tomatoes, basil and bocconcini on a delicate toast point. Our meals arrived with perfect timing as our plates were cleared. I was amazed at the flavor and texture of each pearled grain of rice in the paella, infused with the savory seafood and spices. My dining companion raved equally about their perfectly cooked salmon, moist and flavorful, served over a bed of linguini in a light yet complex cream sauce. For dessert, we split a trio of mini treats - a chocolate mousse cup, cheesecake bite and creme brulee that satisfied our sweet cravings without leaving us too full. The bill was reasonable for the quality of ingredients and service. We left feeling content and would love to return to Upstream again for another relaxing and delicious meal.",

I practically had to duke it out with some trucker just to get in there and both toilets were stopped up something fierce. The whole place smelled like a urinal cake left out in the sun if you know what I mean. I just don't know what happened to this place but they gotta turn it around fast or they're gonna go outta business. No way am I subjecting myself to another meal there until they get their act together.

Whether you're in the mood for rock, folk, blues or anything in between, they've got you covered. I stopped by on a Thursday night and caught a really fun indie folk act on stage. The lead singer had a great voice and the crowd was really into it. After their set ended, I hung around the bar for a bit. That's when I noticed a few guyssetting up instruments in the corner - turns out an acoustic blues trio was starting a late night set. I ordered another drink and settled in to listen. The blues players had amazing chemistry after presumably playing together for years. You could tell they were just having a total blast up there. Around midnight they started playing some slower tunes that really filled the room. By that point the crowd had dwindled quite a bit but the half dozen of us left were completely enthralled. At the end of their first song one guy remarked \"Man, these guys are killin' it tonight!\" which made me chuckle. It was definitely one of the better random weeknight shows I've caught at a local joint. Whether you go for the eclectic programming or the cozy dive bar atmosphere, The Double Door is definitely worth checking out if you haven't been before.

I asked them to clarify the radius but the driver just muttered something under his breath and drove off. Wish this place was closer to my side of town! The hotel itself was pretty packed when we arrived after hastily getting an Uber. Check-in took forever since they were short staffed. Our room was tiny and had a funny taste to it, like they tried masking something with air freshener. We didn't even bother unpacking. After dropping our bags, we headed to the \"complimentary\" breakfast which was packed and we were told there would be an hour wait just for a table. Yikes. That night we gave the restaurant on site a try but the food was mediocre and overpriced. Nothing exciting on the tv either. In the morning, the waffles machine was broken so I just grabbed a muffin for the road. Checkout was smooth thankfully.

The staff was really friendly and helpful when checking in - the girl at the front desk recommended some local spots for dinner and drinks. Only thing is parking is pricey at $25 a night so we ended up using Lyft most places. Our room was tiny but worked fine for an overnight stay, although the AC was crazy loud so we didn't get the best sleep. Breakfast looked pretty sad in the morning - just your basic bagels, yogurt, and granola so we decided to hit up 5Church for something better before heading out. Location is definitely the biggest perk here since you're so close to everything downtown. Oh and the beds were surprisingly comfortable despite the small space! Only other negative was how thin the walls were - you could hear the people in the rooms on both sides very clearly which was a little annoying. But overall for one night it served our purposes of being close to the Panthers game without having to pay stadium prices to park. Next time a conference I'm attending is in Charlotte, I'll be looking at other properties in close proximity to the conference center or staying further out and riding the train in.",

I really wanted to like this restaurant but in the end it just didn't do it for me. The idea of a trendy new cafe sounded great on paper but the reality fell a bit flat. The food was okay, nothing really wow-ed me but nothing was outright bad either, it was all pretty average really. The service was fine, a little slow at times but the staff were friendly enough. The main issue for me was the space, it was way too small and cramped inside. We could barely move between the tables and felt like we were on top of the other diners the whole time. On a busy night it must feel claustrophobic in there. I also didn't love how loud it got with all the hard surfaces, you really had to raise your voice to be heard.If they'd put even a few plants or photos on the walls it might have felt less stark and industrial but it really lacked character or charm. The music was good but very loud too.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the Instagram shots from the beautiful dishes look great but in reality the ambiance really fell flat for me. It was trying too hard to be a cool hipster spot rather than having its own identity. And honestly, who cares about being trendy if you don't enjoy actually hanging out there?In the end, while the food and service were satisfactory, I didn't really feel like I needed to return. It had the novelty factor the first time around but I can easily pass on it in future. With so many other great options in the area, this place didn't give me a real \"Wow I must come back!\" feeling. Those babies deserve my repeat business more than this place does right now.Maybe they just need to find their feet still but for me, it didn't feel worth battling the crowds for an average experience.

When we first got to our room, the mini fridge was busted and not cooling at all. Not a good thing since we had snacks and drinks we wanted to keep chilled. The bathroom was clean enough but pretty dated. As we were leaving for dinner on the first night, I noticed the ice machine and pop machine in the hallway were both empty with no refill in sight. Kinda disappointing since I would have skipped the free breakfast to get a soda instead. The breakfast itself was underwhelming - just plain bagels and muffins with bad coffee. Not very filling for the whole day. The staff was friendly enough but always seemed busy and not very helpful. One morning the hot water was out which made for a very cold shower start to the day. The bed was also on the softer side and sank in pretty good in the middle. By the second night my back was not too happy. The location was fairly convenient for what we needed but there wasn't much around the hotel itself. When we checked out, it was a relief to head elsewhere.

When the sky finally darkened outside, you dragged your weary self to the deserted and poorly lit parking lot in search of your sad rented vehicle, barely able to see two feet in front of you in the gloom. Inside the non-descript sedan you gathered what vestiges of willpower remained to navigate to some anonymous chain motel, hoping against hope they'd have a vacancy at this hour. Pulling into the harshly lit lot, you spied the telltale blinking of an available room and almost cried with relief that your long nightmarish journey may finally come to an end, if only behind the thin walls of a cheap roadside slumber.",

He had heard me rave about their rum bar and live jazz but nothing could have prepared him for the experience. We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday, figuring it might be a bit packed but hoping to still get a table. Lucky for us, a small high-top opened up by the bar just as we walked in. The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. Our server, a friendly gentleman named David, came over to greet us and recommend a few seasonal cocktails. I went with my usual dark and stormy while my partner opted for something sweeter with ginger beer and dark rum. We both agreed it was the perfect drink to complement the jazz quartet on stage.While we sipped our cocktails, we people watched and took in the atmosphere. It really felt like a neighborhood hangout where regulars chatted with one another or focused on the stage. At one point, some newer patrons near us complained the music was too loud, which got some eye rolls from others closer to the band. My partner leaned over and whispered \"I can see why you love it here so much.\"As we nursed our drinks, David checked in a few times to see if we wanted anything else. We were content to sit and listen so long as our glasses didn't empty too fast. Around 9, the place was really in full swing but still maintained an unrushed and easy vibe. My partner declared he was officially a fan and thanked me for introducing him to such a hidden gem of an spot. I had to agree - it was the perfect low-key Saturday night out.",

But this particular location has surprised me in the best possible way. The staff here actually seem happy to be working, which is refreshing enough on its own. But they also go out of their way to be friendly and helpful to customers. The teen behind the counter yesterday even cracked a few jokes to make my kids smile. The restaurant itself is always spic and span too. Not a single wrapper or stray fry in sight. You can tell someone takes pride in keeping this place ship shape. And I don't know if it's just this location, but the fries have been extra crispy and salty lately. Like, straight from the fryer, almost-too-hot-to-eat good. Even my picky eight-year-old licks the carton clean.The burgers are always cooked to order too. None of that slightly ominous pinkish hue sitting under the bun. And I swear the patties are juicier and more flavorsome than normal McD's fare. With long weekends comes the dreaded lunch time rush. But service here remains speedy yet friendly through the thick of it. You'd think they'd be more harassed and terse when slammed, but nope. All in all, this McDonald's gives me hope that not all fast food experiences need to be ruthlessly efficient but soullessly served. There's room for care, pride and decent customer care even in a chain setting.So if you find yourself craving a Big Mac in these parts, don't hesitate. You'll leave satisfied and maybe even with a smile on your face. Which is more than I expect from most Golden Arches outfits, if I'm honest.",

This airport has three concourses that are well-spaced out and easy to navigate between. Be sure to use any security checkpoint as they usually have the shortest lines. Don't forget you can also skip the lines by enrolling in TSA PreCheck or Clear if you travel a lot. Once through security, be on the lookout for the many local food options - you'll find everything from pizza to pho to snacks from favorite city brands. When it's time to head to your gate, the airport's mobile app and electronic signs clearly show terminal assignments and how far each walk will be. If running late, don't panic as most gates here seem to board late and the free electric carts are a quick ride between concourses. Speaking of rides, be sure to budget extra time if renting a car as the rental lots are located off-site - plan for a 10 minute ride each way. The airport recently added a lot of charging stations which are much appreciated on long layovers. Be warned that WiFi can get bogged down during peak travel times so have some downloaded entertainment as a backup. Also, keep an eye out for exhibition spaces featuring local artists - it's a nice break from the usual airport clutter. Finally, don't forget to check out the rooftop garden above security - it's a lovely spot for some fresh air between flights. And with that, bon voyage - see you again next time through this surprisingly passenger-friendly airport!",

I didn't wanna be that table when they played, let me tell you. I'm real pumped to check out some games now that they're back at the spacious Spectrum Center. I heard Fuel Pizza is gonna be slinging slices at the concession stands this year, so that's a huge plus in my book. Wonder how the season's gonna turn out now that they got Al Jefferson and Lance Stephenson on the squad. Think they can make a playoff push? I sure hope so, it'd be awesome to have some postseason ball in CLT again. Either way I'm just happy the Hornets nostalgia is back, it feels right having them repping the Queen City.

You practically have to weave in and out of crowds just to walk from one end of a terminal to the other. On top of that, it always seems like half the airport is under some kind of construction so there's fences and barricades blocking off different areas. Don't even get me started on trying to find a bathroom around here. You'd think with how many people are always coming and going that they'd have more than just a couple scattered about each concourse. But nope, you often have to trudge all the way to the other end and there's always a huge line. By the time it's your turn, you're about ready to go right then and there just to avoid the wait! The food options are pretty boring too. It's all basically the same old chain places you can find in any other airport. Nothing unique or local to get excited about. And forget about finding a decent meal for anything under $15, it's all snacks and pre-made sandwiches at inflated prices. Sometimes I just skip eating altogether rather than dig into my wallet that deep.Even getting around the terminals is a slog sometimes. Escalators and people movers are always packed so it takes forever to move a few gates over. Forget wheeling a bunch of luggage through that mess too. By the time you're where you're going, your arms feel like jelly. And good luck navigating with any kind of delay - the signs are confusing and it's too easy to end up on the wrong concourse altogether. WiFi is spotty at best and forget finding an open power outlet near your gate. Those things are more scarce than the bathroom stalls. The seats are worn out too, so you're either sinking into one hoping the cushion releases you or perched on the edge of a metal bench praying your tailbone survives the wait.",

The hotel has an indoor pool and hot tub which would have been nice to use, but it was undergoing renovations during our stay so they were closed. The free breakfast had the usual fare like cereal, toast and eggs but nothing too exciting. The location is a bit out of the way, about a 20 minute drive from downtown.

I get that customer service isn't fun, but some smiles wouldn't kill ya. At this point, I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. The negativity was suffocating. On my way out, I heard Suzie's manager screaming at her for being 5 minutes late from her break.

It's definitely not what I'm used to! While the weather is nice, I can't say I love battling crowds of people just to get through security. Once you make it inside it's still packed. There's people everywhere you turn! I struggled to even find a place to sit as every single seat was taken. The terminals are nice enough but it really makes you appreciate having some personal space, which is lacking here for sure. Then finding my gate was a whole other ordeal. All the signs are small and gates seem much further apart than I'm used to. It took me a good twenty minutes to track down where I needed to be. Other than that, the staff have all been very friendly which I appreciate given how stressful it must get working in such a busy place. Still, I'm not sure how you can manage to be that unhappy when you live in a nice town with weather like this!

Everyone started placing their orders and chatting about the holidays. Drinks kept flowing as we caught up on office gossip too. Food came out pretty quickly despite how busy it was. Bottom line, everything was delicious!Had to ask for a carry out box halfway through because there was no way I could finish the massive portion.

My mom was a bit skeptical at first, but even she couldn't deny the delicious flavors and savory broth. My sister, who's a picky eater, even tried it and ended up loving it. It was a great bonding experience for all of us, and we still talk about those meals to this day.The best part about pho is how customizable it is. You can add whatever toppings you like, from bean sprouts and lime wedges to fresh herbs and chili sauce. My dad liked to add a ton of Sriracha to his, while my mom preferred a more subtle approach with just a squeeze of lime. I liked to load up on the fresh herbs, like basil and cilantro, to give it a fresh and fragrant flavor. My sister liked to keep it simple with just a sprinkle of bean sprouts and a drizzle of hoisin sauce.Another great thing about pho is how versatile it is. You can have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it's always satisfying. My family and I would often have it for lunch after a long morning of exploring the city. It was a great way to refuel and recharge for the rest of the day. And the best part? It's usually pretty affordable, so it's a great option for budget-conscious travelers like us.I'm so glad I got to share my love of pho with my family during our trip. It's a memory that I'll always cherish, and I can't wait to go back and try more pho restaurants in the future. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot.

I mean, have you tried their signature sandwich? It's like a party in your mouth.But let's not forget about the coffee. Oh man, their coffee is like liquid gold. It's like they're putting crack in it or something, because I can't get enough. I'm pretty sure I'd give up my firstborn child for a cup of their coffee.The atmosphere is also top-notch. It's got this cozy, small-town vibe that makes you feel like you're in a real community. Like, I've seen the same people here every week for years, and it's just nice to know that there are still places like this that exist.And the staff? Forget about it. They're like family. They know me by name, and they always make sure I'm taken care of. Like, I had a cold once, and they brought me a cup of tea without me even asking. I mean, talk about service.So yeah, even though it's a bit of a hike to get here, it's totally worth it. I'd walk 10 miles for this place, no problem. It's just that good.In conclusion, if you haven't been here yet, you need to get your butt in gear and check it out. It's not just a place to eat, it's an experience. And who knows, you might even see me there. I'll be the one with the big smile and the even bigger appetite.",

It's like stepping into a different world, one where the only currency is cheese and the only language spoken is \"Taco Bell.\" The staff are always friendly and enthusiastic, greeting you with a chirpy \"Welcome to Taco Bell!\" that makes you feel like you're part of the family.

Youload up your tray with a rainbow of salsas and a side of queso (because, priorities), and sit down at a table that's sticky with the memories of a thousand taco Tuesdays.

I'm a big fan of their crepes, they're like a work of art. I've tried a lot of their menu items, but I always come back to the classics. The \"Crepes Banane\" is to die for, it's like a match made in heaven. The combination of the soft, fluffy crepe and the sweet, caramelized banana is just perfect. And the \"Crepes Saint-Germain\" is a close second, the spinach and feta cheese are such a great combination. But honestly, you can't go wrong with any of their crepes, they're all delicious.I've also tried their coffee, and let me tell you, it's amazing. It's strong and rich, just the way I like it. And the service is always top-notch, the staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, it's the perfect place to grab a quick bite or meet up with friends. I've been there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and it's always been great.One time I went there with my family, and we had a great time. My mom loved the \"Crepes Suzette\" and my dad had the \"Crepes Normandes\" and we all shared a \"Crepes Caramel\" for dessert. It was such a nice experience, we all left feeling full and happy.My only complaint is that it can get a bit pricey, but it's totally worth it. I mean, you're paying for quality here. And honestly, it's not like it's twice the price of other creperies, it's just a bit more expensive. But like I said, it's worth every penny. I'll continue to go there for all my crepe cravings.",

The menu offers a great selection of traditional Japanese dishes, along with some creative twists on classic favorites. I always start with the miso soup, which is rich and savory, with a generous helping of tofu and seaweed. The sushi is always fresh and expertly prepared, with unique flavor combinations that never fail to impress. The ramen is a must-try, with a rich pork broth and springy noodles that are cooked to perfection. The tempura is crispy and flavorful, with a variety of seafood and vegetable options to choose from. The prices are very reasonable, especially given the high quality of the food and service. I've been coming here for years, and it never fails to impress. I highly recommend Soba to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Japanese meal.",

The restaurant was a trendy little spot in the heart of the city, known for its creative takes on classic dishes. As I walked in, I was immediately struck by the lively atmosphere – the dim lighting, the bustling crowd, and the upbeat tunes all added to the energetic vibe.I was greeted by a friendly hostess, who led me to a cozy table by the window. The decor was sleek and modern, with a penchant for minimalism that I rather appreciated. After a quick glance at the menu, I knew I was in for a treat – the options read like a laundry list of my favorite foods, with a few unexpected twists thrown in for good measure.My eyes landed on the burrata appetizer, and I knew I had to give it a try. It arrived promptly, and let me tell you, it was love at first bite. The creamy cheese was perfectly balanced by the tangy tomato sauce and the crispy bread, making for a delicious and satisfying start to my meal.For my entree, I opted for the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection – juicy, flavorful, and flaky, just the way I like it. The accompanying quinoa and vegetables were a nice touch, adding some welcome variety to the dish. And let's not forget the service – the waitstaff were attentive and friendly, always refilling my glass of water and ensuring that I had everything I needed.As I finished my meal, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the last-minute cancellation that had led me to this delightful culinary experience. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best things in life come when we least expect them. And who knows? Maybe I'll even start to enjoy the occasional spontaneous night out, Groupon or not.",

The flavors were completely off balance, with the rhubarb overpowered by an excess of ice and a lingering aftertaste that was borderline unpleasant. It was a disappointing start to our meal, and not a great sign of things to come.Moving on to the appetizers, the Potstickers were a surprise hit. They were perfectly cooked, with a delicate balance of crispy and chewy textures. The filling was flavorful and savory, with a depth of umami that left me wanting more. The dipping sauce was also a highlight, with a tangy and slightly sweet flavor that complemented the potstickers perfectly.The Lettuce Wraps, on the other hand, were a bit of a miss. The lettuce was limp and lacked any real crunch, and the filling was uninspired and lacking in flavor. The dish felt like a bit of an afterthought, and I couldn't help but feel that the kitchen could have put more effort into it.Moving on to the entrees, the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap was a real standout. The bowl was filled to the brim with a variety of colorful vegetables, all cooked to perfection. The rice was fluffy and well-seasoned, and the runny fried egg on top was the perfect addition. The sauces were also well-balanced, with a nice balance of spicy and sweet flavors.The Vietnamese Beef Noodles were also a hit. The noodles were cooked just right, with a nice chew to them. The beef was tender and flavorful, and the broth was rich and savory. The dish felt like a authentic representation of Vietnamese cuisine, and I couldn't help but feel impressed by the restaurant's ability to execute it so well.Overall, the meal was a bit of a mixed bag. While some dishes fell short, others exceeded my expectations. I'm willing to give the restaurant another chance, but for now, I'm left feeling a bit underwhelmed.",

I'm not even exaggerating when I say it's the best dessert I've had all year. I mean, have you ever tasted something that's simultaneously rich, nutty, and slightly crispy? It's like a party in your mouth, and everyone's invited.The presentation is also on point - it's like a work of art, almost too pretty to eat. Almost. But trust me, you'll want to dig in as soon as possible. The texture is perfect, with a satisfying crunch on the outside and a creamy, velvety center. And the flavors? Oh man, it's like a symphony of sweet and savory. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in every bite.I'm not a huge fan of burnt things, but in this case, it really works. It adds a depth of flavor that's missing from other desserts. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good almond? They're like nature's perfect snack.The only problem is that now I'm ruined for all other desserts. I mean, what's the point of even trying anything else when you know this exists? It's like, why settle for less when you can have the best?I'm not sure what kind of magic they're using at Shadyside, but they need to bottle it and sell it. Stat. Because honestly, this dessert is worth any price. I'd pay top dollar for a slice of this heaven.The only thing I can compare it to is a classic New York cheesecake, but even that's not doing it justice. This is like, next level. It's like a cheesecake and a brownie had a baby, and that baby was raised by unicorns and fed on rainbows.Okay, I know I'm gushing, but seriously, this dessert is the real deal. Do yourself a favor and go try it. Now. Like, drop everything and go. You won't regret it. And if you do, well, we can't be friends anymore.Just kidding, but seriously, this burnt almond torte is the bomb.com. You won't find anything better, I promise.",

The decor was traditional Thai, with ornate carvings and colorful silks adorning the walls. The aroma of exotic spices and fresh herbs filled the air, making my mouth water in anticipation.Heather, who had been there before, recommended the Tom Yum soup and the Pad Thai. Elizabeth and I decided to follow her lead and ordered the same dishes.The soup arrived first, and let me tell you, it was love at first sip. It was tangy and spicy, with just the right amount of sweetness. The shrimp were plump and juicy, and the lemongrass and lime leaves added a nice depth of flavor. I could have easily made a meal out of the soup alone.The Pad Thai, on the other hand, was a bit of a letdown. The noodles were overcooked and the shrimp were a bit rubbery. The flavors were still there, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations.Despite the disappointing Pad Thai, the service was impeccable. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, always refilling our water glasses and making sure we had everything we needed.As we finished our meal, Elizabeth and I decided to split a Thai tea for dessert. It was creamy and sweet, with a hint of spice. The perfect way to cap off a delicious meal.I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed with this Thai place. Despite a small hiccup with the Pad Thai, the overall experience was fantastic. I'll definitely be back, and next time I'll bring my appetite for some of that amazing Tom Yum soup.As we left, I turned to Elizabeth and said, \"I can't wait to come back here again.\" She smiled and nodded in agreement.",

We freshened up and decided to explore the city, starting with the famous NASCAR Hall of Fame. The museum was filled with interactive exhibits and historic race cars, giving us a glimpse into the world of racing and its rich history.After spending a few hours at the museum, we decided to grab some lunch at a nearby restaurant. The food was delicious, with a mix of southern comfort food and modern twists on classic dishes. We ended our meal with a slice of pecan pie, which was the perfect way to cap off our first day in Charlotte.With our bellies full, we headed to the Levine Museum of the New South. The museum told the story of the South's history and culture, from the Civil War to the present day. The exhibits were informative and thought-provoking, giving us a deeper understanding of the region and its people.As the day came to a close, we headed back to our hotel, feeling grateful for the warm welcome we had received from the city.",

It was like they just threw some cornstarch at it and hoped for the best. Needless to say, I left the restaurant feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.

The TV started playing the same episode of \"The Price is Right\" over and over again, and the lights in the room began flickering like they were trying to signal us something. We tried to ignore it and go to sleep, but it was impossible.Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the sun started to rise and we could see the light of day peeking through the curtains.",

As soon as we walked in, I could feel the warm and inviting atmosphere that only an Italian restaurant can provide. The decor was simple yet elegant, with vintage family photos adorning the walls and a spacious bar area where patrons could watch the chefs at work. We were greeted promptly by the friendly hostess, who led us to our cozy table by the window.The menu offered a diverse selection of traditional Italian dishes, including pastas, risottos, and seafood options. I was eager to try Lidia's famous pierogies, which were surprisingly delicious, with a fluffy potato filling and a crispy, buttery crust. For my main course, I opted for the vitello Milanese, which was cooked to perfection and served with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and a flavorful vegetable medley. My dining companion raved about her pasta dish, the tagliatelle al ragù, which was rich and satisfying, with a hearty beef and pork ragu and a generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.The portion sizes were generous, and we both left feeling pleasantly full and content. The prices were reasonable, especially considering the quality of the ingredients and the skillful preparation of the dishes. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, answering our questions about the menu with ease and making recommendations based on our preferences. The pacing of the meal was leisurely, allowing us to savor each course and enjoy the company of our fellow diners.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with Lidia's Pittsburgh, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in search of an authentic Italian dining experience.
