TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR.

Our observations reveal that the dust emission exhibits a distinct peak at an orbital radius of approximately 160 AU, while the CO intensity displays a peak coinciding with the stellar position, consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.3 Solar masses. Utilizing theoretical disk models, we infer that the disk surface density, Sigma(r), increases sharply from 60 to 160 AU and then decreases exponentially outward. The inner region of the disk, within 60 AU, is likely optically thin in the millimeter continuum emission, as implied by the observed dust morphology.

Understanding the role of knots in proteins is crucial for unraveling their impact on stability, enzymatic activities, binding capabilities, and their association with various diseases such as Parkinson's. However, the scarcity of knotted proteins remains enigmatic, prompting the need for comprehensive investigations into their formation and occurrence. Here, we propose a novel perspective on the rarity of knots in proteins, suggesting that their prevalence is constrained by the tendency to induce swelling in short protein chains, which are overrepresented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).To shed light on the intricate nature of protein knots, Monte Carlo simulations were employed to predict the most compact protein configuration for the figure-8 knot within a specific range of amino acid lengths. We found that protein chains containing 200-600 amino acids exhibited the greatest compactness when forming the figure-8 knot. Furthermore, we estimated an upper limit of 300-400 amino acids for the theoretical existence of the simplest knot, the trefoil, aligning with the available PDB data.Expanding our understanding of protein knots, we investigated the mechanical properties of the figure-of-eight knot in the chromophore-binding domain of the red/far-red photoreceptor, phytochrome. Through protein engineering and atomic force microscopy, we uncovered distinctive mechanical unfolding pathways and forces required for apo phytochrome and chromophore-bound phytochrome. Surprisingly, the presence of the knot did not confer super-stability, as the forces measured during unfolding were relatively low compared to other mechanically unfolding proteins.Moreover, our experiments revealed the reduction in knot size under load, with the tightened knot comprising only 17 amino acids in the unfolded chain.",

This study aims to disentangle the nature of the blue plume population in dSphs. Analyzing a sample of 9 non-star forming Local Group dwarf galaxies, we investigate the \"BSS frequency\" and compare it with that of Milky Way globular/open clusters and the halo. Our analysis reveals that the BSS frequency in dwarf galaxies, at a given absolute magnitude (Mv), consistently exceeds that of globular clusters with similar luminosities. Remarkably, the estimated BSS frequency in the lowest luminosity dSphs corresponds closely to observations in the Milky Way halo and open clusters. These findings suggest that the low-density, virtually collision-less environment of these dwarf galaxies indicates minimal dynamical evolution and insignificant production of collisional BSSs.In a follow-up investigation of two specific dSphs, Sculptor and Fornax, the presence of BSS candidates is examined. In Fornax, there are indications of contamination by young stars within the BSS population, while no clear evidence of recent star formation is found in Sculptor. The radial and luminosity distributions of BSS candidates are derived using wide field imaging data that extend beyond the nominal tidal radius of the galaxies. The radial distribution in Sculptor aligns with that of red horizontal branch (RHB) stars and agrees with theoretical expectations for BSSs formed through mass transfer in binaries. Conversely, the radial distribution of BSS candidates in Fornax is more concentrated compared to other considered stellar populations, supporting the hypothesis that a significant portion of BSS candidates in Fornax are indeed young stars. These findings are consistent with previous studies in the field.",

Through meticulous analysis, we have identified a series of concentric dust rings with varying brightness and morphology. The innermost ring, located at a radial distance of approximately 20 AU, exhibits a compact and smooth structure, while the outer rings show signs of fragmentation and clumpiness. The observation of azimuthal asymmetries in the disk hints at the presence of dynamical interactions or gravitational perturbations. By comparing our results with previous studies, we find evidence for ongoing dynamical processes shaping the dust distribution, potentially caused by encounters with forming planets or companion stars. Our findings highlight the significance of HST/ACS coronagraphic observations in unraveling the intricate details of protoplanetary disks and improving our understanding of the planet formation mechanisms. Further investigations combining multiwavelength observations and hydrodynamical modeling will be crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the HD 100546 system and its evolutionary stages.",

These Ly-alpha nebulae exhibit an immense size, extending over hundreds of kiloparsecs, and are characterized by intense emission at Ly-alpha wavelengths. Our study aims to investigate the physical properties, kinematics, and origins of these giant Ly-alpha nebulae, shedding light on the processes driving their formation and evolution in the early universe. We obtained high-resolution and multi-object spectra, enabling us to probe the kinematic profiles and line intensities across the nebular structures. By analyzing the spectroscopic data, we derived the velocity dispersion, systemic redshift, and line widths of the Ly-alpha emission, providing insights into the dynamical properties and gas motion within the nebulae. Our results reveal that the Ly-alpha emission exhibits significant spatial variations within the nebulae, suggesting the presence of underlying sources of excitation and energy deposition. Additionally, we examine the relationships between Ly-alpha luminosity, radio luminosity, and other key properties of the radio galaxies, exploring potential connections between the AGN activity and the Ly-alpha nebulae. Overall, our spectroscopic study provides crucial information about the physical characteristics and dynamics of these massive Ly-alpha nebulae, contributing to our understanding of galaxy formation and the role of radio galaxies in the early universe.",

Our results reveal that the deformed Wigner crystal configuration can be achieved by appropriately tuning the external parameters, leading to a rich variety of structural deformations. Furthermore, we delve into the dynamics of the deformed Wigner crystal, exploring its response to external perturbations and thermal effects. Through extensive simulations, we elucidate the influence of various factors such as temperature, electron-electron interactions, and external fields on the behavior of the crystal. Our findings demonstrate that the deformed Wigner crystal exhibits distinctive dynamic properties, including collective oscillations and rearrangements of the electron density distribution. Finally, we investigate the impact of disorder and impurities on the deformed Wigner crystal, highlighting the effects of disorder-induced localization and the emergence of localized states within the crystal.

We present a detailed analysis of the fate of vibrationally excited H2O, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3 molecules initially embedded at different depths in an amorphous water ice matrix, focusing on the competition between energy loss and molecular desorption. We find that hot molecules can escape if they are located in the top three ice layers, with the probability for desorption decreasing roughly exponentially with the initial depth of the excited species. The desorption of hot species from the ice is accompanied by the formation of H atoms, OH radicals, and molecular hydrogen.

A relativistically blurred reflection component is required to explain the prominent Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line and the Compton hump in the spectrum.

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm the formation of the ZnO:Co nanoparticles with a Wurtzite structure. The electrical transport measurements exhibit a metal-insulator transition (MIT) behavior for 5% Co-doped ZnO nanoparticles. The temperature dependence of resistivity suggests that the MIT is caused by the Mott's variable-range hopping conduction mechanism. The optical properties of the ZnO:Co nanoparticles were investigated by UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra exhibit a red shift of the absorption edge with increasing Co doping concentration, indicating the narrowing of the band gap. The PL spectra of the ZnO:Co nanoparticles show a strong emission peak in the visible region, which is attributed to the defect states introduced by Co doping. The results suggest that Co doping can induce ferromagnetism and a MIT in ZnO nanoparticles, making them promising candidates for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.",

In order to implement a stabilization mechanism for the dilaton at late times, we have considered the possibility that the dilaton potential is generated by the presence of a Gauss-Bonnet term in the action. For vanishing dilaton potential, we have found that the Gauss-Bonnet term generates a power-law expansion of the universe of the form a(t)\\propto t^p, with the exponent p depending on the value of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient. In the case of a non-vanishing dilaton potential, the power-law expansion is modified in such a way that the potential can dominate at late times and provide an accelerated expansion. Finally, we have found that this mechanism can also generate bouncing solutions of the cosmological evolution, with the bounce taking place at an epoch in which the Gauss-Bonnet term dominates over the dilaton potential.",

The minimal gauge mediation scenario, however, has long been known to be incompatible with the observed abundance of dark matter for typical values of messenger scale and SUSY breaking scale. We propose a novel solution to this problem based on introducing emergent supersymmetry, a softly-broken hidden sector that communicates supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector via a messenger sector that is only weakly coupled to the hidden sector. We calculate the dark matter relic density in this framework and find that a significant region of parameter space with gauge mediation is compatible with all experimental data, including dark matter. We find that the correct dark matter abundance can be obtained while maintaining a relatively low messenger scale, allowing for interesting collider signatures at the LHC. In addition, we point out that this framework may naturally have signatures in flavor physics.",

The bolometric light curve of SN 2001el is found to be similar to that of a typical SN Ia, although the peak luminosity is fainter than average. The P-Cygni profiles of Si II 635.5 nm absorption remain visible up to 100 days after maximum, and a comparison with synthetic spectra suggests that the ejecta of SN 2001el are characterized by low expansion velocities (∼11,000 km s−1). The evolution of the spectra in the optical and NIR is also consistent with those of normal SNe Ia. Our multi-color light curves, combined with a simple model, suggest that a substantial amount of 56Ni (∼0.7 Msun) was synthesized during the explosion, which is significantly larger than the typical value (∼0.4–0.6 Msun) for normal SNe Ia. This implies that SN 2001el was originated from a massive white dwarf progenitor system, which is also supported by the low ejecta velocities.

We perform one-dimensional, multi-species, electromagnetic, particle-in-cell simulations. The effects of the non-Maxwellian ion velocity distribution in the upstream region due to the pickup process are taken into account in a self-consistent manner. Our results show that the reflected ions and the upstream ions form counterstreaming beams in the transition zone. The development of a current-driven electrostatic instability results in the generation of strong whistler waves. The wave-particle interactions lead to a non-Maxwellian ion distribution function, characterized by the formation of a high-energy tail in the downstream region. These results are important for understanding the microphysics of collisionless shocks observed in various space plasmas, including the Earth's bow shock and the solar wind termination shock.",

Dark matter halo profiles predicted by LambdaCDM cosmological simulations provide good fits to the inferred gravitational potential. Approximately 10% of the Milky Way's HI gas is found in the large radial and scale height, turbulent outer component beyond 40 kpc. The results indicate that the Milky Way HI disk and its kinematics can serve as a tracer of the underlying gravitational potential, revealing information about the galaxy's dark matter halo as predicted by the LambdaCDM paradigm of structure formation.",

We employ the techniques of geometric mechanics and Lie group reductions to map the elastica equations to a reduced space stratified by Poisson structures. By analyzing the singularites in the reduced Poisson bracket, we identify the codimension-one Maxwell strata where the ranks of the Poisson maps change. The intrinsic geometric properties of these Maxwell sets are then investigated using moving frame methods on the relevant jet bundles. The results yield new insights into the nonlinear dynamics near strata of changing symplectic leaf type. By resolving the topological singularities associated with the Maxwell sets, one obtains a regularization of the reduced dynamics with improved qualitative behavior. Our work thus sheds light on the deep connections between Hamiltonian singularities and equilibrium configurations in Euler's problem of elastica.",

Using a suite of numerical simulations, we model the detectability of TTV signals induced by exomoons with masses ranging from that of Mars to Neptune orbiting gas giant exoplanets. We analyze the simulated TTV data using Bayesian inference to retrieve the orbital parameters and physical properties of the exomoons. We find TTV observations enable precise determinations of exomoon mass and semi-major axis for moons larger than approximately half the size of Earth's Moon. We compare the recovered exomoon masses and densities to those of the moons in our own Solar System. For moons with short orbital periods of less than a few Earth days around a Jupiter-sized planet, we can place constraints on exomoon radius to within approximately 10-20% using TTV measurements from current ground-based photometric surveys. Our models incorporate first-order post-Newtonian corrections to the three-body problem, and we investigate potential biases from third-body perturbations by additional planets in multi-planet systems.

This allows us to leverage powerful tools from representation theory, such as the Frobenius reciprocity and the Mackey-Mueller theorem, to study the representations of Baumslag-Solitar groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by computing the character tables of the Baumslag-Solitar groups, and by deriving new bounds on the dimensions of their representations. We also discuss connections to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and number theory, and highlight some open problems and future directions for research. Overall, our approach provides a novel and powerful tool for studying representations of Baumslag-Solitar groups, and has the potential to shed new light on the structure and properties of these fascinating groups.",

The results demonstrate that the diffusion process is significantly affected by the distance-dependent probability of links, with the presence of long-range connections altering the diffusion dynamics. Specifically, the simulations show that the diffusion rate accelerates with increasing probability of long-range links, ultimately approaching the same rate as that of a fully connected network. However, the diffusion process becomes slower as the distance between nodes increases, indicating that the presence of long-range links does not entirely eliminate the effect of distance.

The spectral profile of the emission showed a characteristic triple-step structure, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the emission is produced by electrons accelerated by the CME-driven shock. The results suggest that the CME's fast speed and strong magnetic field are responsible for the observed synchrotron emission. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the physics of CMEs and their interactions with the solar wind.",

Previous studies have suggested that dark matter and baryons have different velocity distributions, but these differences have proven difficult to quantify accurately. We present a new approach that utilizes the halo velocity anisotropy to measure the distinction between dark matter and baryons. Our method takes into account the effects of galaxy bias and tidal stripping, which have previously hindered accurate measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using simulated data, showing that it can accurately capture the velocity anisotropy of dark matter and baryons. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the properties of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. We conclude that the halo velocity anisotropy is a valuable tool for measuring the fundamental difference between dark matter and baryons, and that our approach provides a promising avenue for future research in this area.",

Despite its importance, the order of this transition has remained a subject of debate, with various studies suggesting different scenarios. In this article, we investigate the order of the 2D polymer escape transition using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. We find that the transition exhibits a non-universal critical behavior, which cannot be described by a single scaling law. Instead, we observe a crossover between two different regimes, characterized by distinct power-law exponents. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the 2D polymer escape transition and shed light on the underlying mechanisms that govern this phenomenon. The insights gained from this study have important implications for the design and engineering of soft matter systems, and contribute to the development of new materials with unique properties.",

We begin by reviewing the notion of bubbling AdS spacetimes, which are solutions to the equations of motion of IIB supergravity that are characterized by the presence of bubbles in the spacetime. These bubbles are finite regions of spacetime where the gravitational pull is so strong that the universe \"bubbles up\" into a higher-dimensional space. We then turn to the concept of droplet descriptions of BPS geometries, which are certain types of supersymmetric solutions to the equations of motion of IIB supergravity that are characterized by the presence of \"droplets\" of supersymmetry. We show that there is a deep connection between bubbling AdS spacetimes and droplet descriptions of BPS geometries, and that the former can be used to gain insight into the latter. In particular, we demonstrate that bubbling AdS spacetimes can be used to construct droplet descriptions of BPS geometries, and that the resulting droplets have a number of interesting properties. Our results provide new insights into the structure of BPS geometries in IIB supergravity, and demonstrate the power of bubbling AdS spacetimes as a tool for studying these objects.",

We found that the young stars have higher radial velocities than the intermediate and old stars, indicating that they are still contracting and evolving. The intermediate and old stars, on the other hand, have similar radial velocities, suggesting that they have reached a stable state.

Using a combination of observations and modeling, we investigate the conditions under which the CIV effect occurs and explore the possibility of detecting the resulting continuum emission. Our results suggest that the CIV effect may be observable in specific astrophysical environments, such as in the vicinity of stars or in regions of high radiation intensity. We propose strategies for detecting the continuum emission associated with the CIV effect and discuss the implications of such a detection for our understanding of interstellar chemistry and radiation physics.

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Historic England's research is only the tip of the iceberg as it's almost impossible to trace what has happened to every piece of public art since 1945.\"We're making efforts to protect the best examples of post-war public art that still exist, and make sure that it continues to enhance the public realm.\"But we also want to raise awareness of just how vulnerable these works can be and we want the public to help us track down lost pieces.\"Henry Moore's Reclining Figure that was stolen from Hertfordshire in 2005 was worth £3m but police believe it was probably melted down and sold for scrap metal for £1,500.Others have been vandalised, including an abstract steel sculpture by Barry Flanagan in Cambridge.Historic England believes public art is under threat because of the price of scrap metal, local authority funding gaps, pressure from redevelopment and vandalism.In 2012, Wakefield Council removed its Henry Moore sculpture from public display and put it in secure storage because of a spate of thefts.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

It's a sort of benign tumour,\" Dr Dhiware said.\"At first, we couldn't cut it out so we had to use the basic chisel and hammer to take it out.\"Once we opened it, little pearl-like teeth started coming out, one-by-one. Initially, we were collecting them, they were really like small white pearls. But then we started to get tired. We counted 232 teeth,\" she added.The surgery, conducted on Monday, involved two surgeons and two assistants. The team was led by Dr Vandana Thorawade who heads the hospital's ENT (ear, nose and throat) department. Ashik now has 28 teeth.Describing Ashik's case as \"very rare\", Dr Dhiware said she had \"not seen anything like this before in my 30-year career\", but said she was \"thrilled to get such an exciting case\".\"According to medical literature available on the condition, it is known to affect the upper jaw and a maximum of 37 teeth have been extracted from the tumour in the past. But in Ashik's case, the tumour was found deep in the lower jaw and it had hundreds of teeth.\"Ashik's father Suresh Gavai was quoted by the Mumbai Mirror as saying that his son complained of severe pain a month ago.\"I was worried that it may turn out to be cancer so I brought him to Mumbai,\" he said.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

The army said an unknown number of people were missing.There had been concerns over the safety of the site in Colombo, with residents demanding it be cleared.The AFP news agency said about 800 tonnes of waste were added to the Meethotamulla dump every day, and that the government had planned to remove it.\"We heard a massive sound. It was like thunder,\" one resident, Kularathna, told the Reuters news agency. \"Tiles in our house got cracked. Black water started coming in.\"The collapse occurred as many people were marking Aluth Avurudda, or the Sinhalese New Year, a major public holiday across Sri Lanka.Emergency officials told the BBC that up to 20 people may remain buried in their houses, with the Sri Lankan army now co-ordinating the recovery.One disaster emergency official told AFP the death toll would have been higher had many people not left their homes after the fire at the dump, hours before the collapse.One government minister, Harsha De Silva, said in a statement that no more rubbish would be dumped at the site, and would instead be placed in two other sites.It is not clear when the decision is made. Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,\" he said.Last month, a landslide at a rubbish dump in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killed at least 113 people.",

One high-profile leader is monk Ashin Wirathu, who recently used abusive language to describe the UN's special envoy to Myanmar.In December, the UN passed a resolution urging Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) to give access to citizenship for the Rohingya, many of whom are classed as stateless.",

Also there will be questions around the transport infrastructure in the area as well.\"I'm always keen for people to think of the local area when it comes to the possibility for more employment... but it's got to be sensitive and in keeping with the area and it has to have a strong level of local support for me.\"Mr Broome took control of Alton Towers in the 1970s, turning it into a major theme park before selling to the Tussauds Group in 1990.",

The patients, one from the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and the other from Lanarkshire, are both in serious conditions. This brings the total number of botulism cases in Glasgow hospitals to four. The infections are believed to have been caused by contaminated heroin. In response to these new cases, NHS Forth Valley has reported treating a confirmed case in one of its hospitals as well.Dr. Catriona Milosevic, a consultant in public health medicine at NHSGGC, has issued a warning to drug users, urging them to be highly vigilant and seek urgent medical attention if they experience early symptoms such as blurred or double vision, difficulty in swallowing and speaking, and inflammation at the injection site. While it is important for injecting drug users to engage with the available services to help tackle their addictions, such as those provided by pharmacies and drug services, Dr. Milosevic emphasized that immediate medical assistance should be sought if these early symptoms manifest. She also recommended that heroin users avoid injecting the drug into their muscles, as injecting into a vein or smoking it can reduce the risk of botulism.The health board has informed Police Scotland about the new cases, and inquiries are underway to investigate further. Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which attacks the nervous system. It is a serious condition that requires prompt medical intervention. Health officials are working diligently to raise awareness about the risks associated with contaminated heroin use and to ensure that drug users are well-informed and equipped to protect themselves from this potentially life-threatening infection.",

The move is aimed at encouraging community involvement in identifying and reporting these individuals.The PSNI believes that by sharing these images on social media, they can harness the power of public engagement to aid in locating and bringing these suspects to justice. The Wild West-inspired pictures will feature the suspects' faces along with a brief description of their offenses and any relevant details.This unconventional tactic has already generated a buzz among the public, with many expressing support for the initiative. However, there have been concerns raised regarding potential privacy issues and the risk of misidentification. In response, the PSNI has assured the public that all efforts will be made to ensure accuracy and protect individual rights.While the approach may seem unorthodox, the PSNI hopes it will serve as a deterrent to potential offenders who may think they can evade the justice system. By leveraging the power of social media, the police force aims to create a stronger bond with the community and foster a sense of shared responsibility in upholding the law.The PSNI's decision to embrace this new method reflects the evolving landscape of law enforcement and the increasing role of technology in crime prevention. As the initiative rolls out, it remains to be seen how effective it will be in addressing the issue of suspects failing to appear in court, but it is undoubtedly a bold step towards engaging the community in crime prevention and reducing the burden on the justice system.",

Having fearlessly stormed two heavily fortified enemy strongholds and captured an astonishing 70 enemy soldiers, Sgt Bye's unwavering determination and heroism earned him the prestigious Victoria Cross. To commemorate his astonishing feats, a ceremony will be held at Ynysangharad Memorial Park in Pontypridd, the town where Sgt Bye was deservedly honored in 2015.Described as a modest man who seldom spoke about his remarkable achievements, Sgt Robert Bye's memory continues to inspire generations of Welsh Guardsmen. His name and courageous deeds have become firmly etched in the annals of history, symbolizing the selflessness, character, and unwavering devotion to duty that the Welsh Guards strive to emulate. Despite the challenges and perils he faced, Sgt Bye survived the arduous battle and returned home to Wales, leaving an indelible mark on his community.As part of the commemoration of the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele, Sgt Bye's legacy will also be remembered at Artillery Wood, the resting place of many fallen Welsh soldiers from the 38th Division, including the renowned Welsh poet Hedd Wyn. Notably, a poignant plaque will be unveiled at the Welsh Memorial for Passchendaele near Langemark, further ensuring that Sgt Robert Bye's sacrifice and gallantry will never be forgotten.The dedication event scheduled for Sunday will serve as a poignant reminder of the immense courage displayed by Sgt Robert Bye and the countless other brave individuals who fought and sacrificed their lives during the Battle of Passchendaele.",

Davis argued that introducing a cap would allow the UK to manage immigration while ensuring the country remains an attractive destination for highly skilled individuals.The debate surrounding immigration has been a central issue in the Brexit discussions, with proponents of stricter controls citing concerns over job opportunities, public resources, and social cohesion. However, opponents argue that free movement of people within the EU promotes cultural diversity, economic growth, and knowledge exchange.The UK's relationship with the EU determines its immigration policies to a certain extent. While it must allow EU citizens to enter and reside in the country as part of EU membership, it has some discretion in determining immigration rules for non-EU nationals. The UK operates a points-based system for most migrants from outside the EU, granting control over admission on a case-by-case basis.With negotiations ongoing between the UK and the EU, immigration policies continue to be a point of contention.

The photo showed Steinbrueck on a boat smiling and holding his hand with his middle finger raised.

Steinbrueck's party has struggled to gain traction in their campaign to defeat Merkel, who remains very popular.

According to Unison, the council's proposal to outsource care home services could result in upwards of 200 caregivers losing their livelihoods due to redundancies. The union has slammed the proposed timescale for consultation on the changes as woefully inadequate, saying caregivers deserve a proper opportunity to have their voices heard on issues directly impacting their employment. Local caregivers spoke of their concern that vulnerable residents may face decreased quality of care and loss of stability if changes are rushed through without taking staff perspectives into account. Despite calls for more talks, the council is maintaining the proposal is necessary to deliver savings and transition to more sustainable care models for those relying on services.",

According to industry insiders, Edmonds had hoped a return to Deal Or No Deal would help build on the enduring popularity of the format which saw contestants attempt to win a top prize by selecting hidden boxes containing various monetary amounts. However, Lee Posner is said to believe the estimated £24m budget required for a full series was too large an investment as Channel 4 seeks to refocus its programming around more distinctive British shows. Deal Or No Deal first launched in the Netherlands in 1999 and went on to become a global television phenomenon, but it seems the quaestor of big-money gambles fronted by Noel Edmonds has now drawn to a close on British screens.",

The local hero turned villain in the 97th minute, intercepting a stray pass just outside the box before turning and rifling an unstoppable effort past Wood keeper Nathan Ashmore. It was a cruel way for manager Luke Garrard's men to lose all three points after they had battled hard for a share of the spoils against their promotion-chasing visitors. The home side had looked the most likely to grab a winner after a host of chances in the second half, including a Jamesowler strike that rattled the crossbar. But as the clock ticked into stoppage time and it seemed the points would be shared, Lokko had other ideas. His late intervention sparked scenes of wild celebration among the sizeable away support who had made the trip from Kent. Boreham Wood must now pick themselves up for the visit of Wealdstone next weekend, though this late sucker punch may live long in the memory. Manager Garrard said his players \"left it all on the pitch\" and praised their effort, though conceded the nature of the defeat was \"very cruel\".Maidstone move up to third with the victory and will head into their encounter with Dagenham and Redbridge high in confidence after Lokko's literal last act heroics.",

The man, who has not been named, used the identity of the prominent aristocrat to book luxury hotel rooms and run up large bills. He was arrested after staff at a hotel in London became suspicious and contacted the real Duke of Marlborough, who confirmed that the man was not a member of his family. In addition to his prison sentence, the fraudster was ordered to pay £11,800 in compensation to the hotels he defrauded. This is not the first time that the Duke of Marlborough has been targeted by fraudsters - in 2019, a man was jailed for using a fake identity to try to sell the Duke's estate for £100 million. The case highlights the importance of vigilance and verifying identities, especially when dealing with high-value transactions.",

The piece, created by artist Anoush Waddington, features a gorilla crafted from 5,000 spoons. The sculpture is a remarkable feat of artistry and engineering, standing at over six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds. The spoons, which were sourced from all over the world, were carefully selected and arranged to create the detailed and realistic form of the gorilla. The sculpture is a testament to Geller's fascination with the intersection of art and magic, and is sure to be a popular attraction when it is displayed in a London gallery next month. Geller has long been known for his boundary-pushing performances, which have included bending spoons and keys with his mind. The gorilla sculpture is a natural extension of this fascination with the manipulation of metal, and promises to be a truly awe-inspiring sight to behold.",

On that fateful day, Smith, a member of the British Army, led his comrades in a fearless charge against the enemy, despite the hail of bullets and artillery shells raining down around them. His heroism and selflessness inspired his fellow soldiers to fight on, and their bravery turned the tide of the battle in favor of the Allies.

All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

Lieutenant Katya Ryzhkina stood besides him, equally wrapped beneath thick layers of wool and thermals.

This world was a far cry from his childhood home of Ryerson with its expansive forests and numerous rivers. Its polar regions were paltry, temperate things compared to Conarky' s, and although the taiga to the south made a welcome change of pace it was a poor substitute for Ryerson' s mixed forests.

I trudged up the steps, leaving footprints in light powder, and knocked. And knocked. And knocked. I began to get uneasy then. A night without heat could get bad in the mountains, and even though I had made it there as fast as I could, I got uneasy.

He was sure he had picked the clone. \" How could I not know I was being tricked? \" he whispered. Thats when it happened, the ceiling exploded into a million tiny shards of glass. They were here, and they wanted their property back. He thought back to the day him and travis stumbled upon that little secret. He remember how they were going to change the world with it. He could n' t help but to smirk. Back then they were so naive. So much time had past since then and everything that had come to light in their investigation. It was almost worth it. Just almost. The ropes were slowly falling for Ben, when he decided to plug the trigger. He knew that in just moments there would be a small team surrounding them to recover the stolen property. He knew one bullet to this travis' s head and everything they had come for would be gone. He wanted to make sure the they would pay for everything he had lost. CLICK. The round is sent spinning through the chamber of the. 45. Sent on it destructive course for the hard bone and soft brain matter of this abomination. But the bullet never meets its target. Instead it is stopped just short. As it falls to the ground, he knows who is here.

Yeah, I' m pretty sure something' s up, Gromm. \" The two old warriors sat at the familiar table in the Green Gyle Tavern, as was their custom on a Tuesday. As always, the freely-flowing mead soon had the comrades reminiscing on old times - which is how this talk of dragons had started in the first place. \" You rarely see dragons this far south, \" Gromm murmured. His fingers, thick and calloused, caressed his beard tenderly. \" Exactly. And the last time - \" \" Last time we rode out against them, Birgnor. I remember it well - how could I not? That bloody bard would n' t shut up about it for months. \" Birgnor grinned. \" Aye, though I think he took the hint after the incident with his lute. \" \" Mmm. \" \" Gromm, this is different. The last time the dragons flew south, they burned and pillaged as they went - it was an attempt at conquest. \" \" And now? \" \" No contact. They simply pass us by, like they do n' t even see us. I' ve heard stories from as far south as Gilmerton, and every tale the same.

Tough, armored bastards, possessing both the power of flight and fire - and that was just the younglings. Legends spoke of the ancient Dragon Elders, whose knowledge of arcane magics and the Messenger' s Path was said to rival even the Vyguard' s. If the dragons were running... \" You know what this means, Birg. \" Bignor looked at his old comrade, jaw set but eyes afire. Gromm stood from the table, draining the dregs of his tankard as he did so. He slammed it down on the table. \" We' ve got ta catch ourselves a dragon. \"",

A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend.

Her eyes were filled with frustration and pity. Yes, I' ll try again next year; yes, I' ll bring a better offering; yes, I' ll pray more fervently; and all that stuff. I ca n' t say that I was too disappointed by my lack of transformation, though. I was n' t exactly distressed. I *am* a shapeshifter, after all.",

The pentagram painted in panda blood flickered the reflection of the many candles around the room. 666 red candles made from the earwax of goats. I had been looking forward to this ever since I was a child and watched little nicky, the idea that Satan was n' t as evil as he appeared had stuck with me for 20 years. Now I was about to find out if it was true. I recited the spell. shadows filled the room and swirled around the ground and up the walls. circling in a demonic dance, moving faster and faster. suddenly darkness took the room and smoke from the newly extinguished candles filled my nostrils. There was a red glow at the center of the room, but i couldnt quite make out what it was. some sort of vapor had filled the basement and I was having a hard time seeing. as the smoke started to settle. I saw it, a slightly glowing silhouette of a big man. he started to move, and as he moved closer i could tell that his belly was big, and his cheeks were flushed. his white beard reaching almos to his belly button. he wore a red coat that shimmered with a dull red glow, and he wore a crown made of deer antlers and chirstmas tree branches. He had a twinkle in his eye that just said *everything is ok* I said \" who are you? \" and the man replied \" I have many names. but the one you would be most familiar with is santa \" his warm voice vibrated in my ears as if he were speaking through a silky and soothing jazz tune. his eyes twinkled as he spoke to me. I questioned him further \" well, how did you get here? \" without even a slight pause he asked \" do you trust me, son? \" well I suppose I do n' t have a reason not to, you are santa after all. \" he pulled me close, gave me a big hug and whispered softly in my ear \" thats good, son. because the only way i can steal your soul is if you trust me. \"",

For the past year I have been delivering for Smitty' s Pizza Hut to get the extra cash I need for my tuition bill. I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

He screamed and the seal screamed and then the seal ran away, pushing past his bedroom door and out into the hall. \" What the fuck was that? \" he said. That fishy, watery smell had stuck around in the room. His carpet was wet, his blanket was wet, and he was pretty certain mold was going to grow underneath his carpets if he did n' t do something about it right now. \" I' d better call Animal Control, \" he said. Then a voice popped into his head: \" Kerrville Animal Control Hotline, how can I help you? \" said a voice in his head. He looked at his hands. Definitely no phone there. \" Hello? Can I help you? \" \" Uh, \" said Reginald. \" What is the nature of your emergency, sir? \" \" I... you can hear me? \" What the fuck is going on, thought Reginald. \" There is no need for that language, sir, \" said the voice on the other line. \" If you do not have an animal problem - \" \" I do, I do, \" said Reginald. \" It' s that... it' s Texas, and there' s a seal in my bathroom. I do n' t know what' s going on. Can you send someone over to pick up the seal? \" \" Another breather. God, I hate this fucking job, \" said the person on the other end of the line as she hung up. He stared out the window. He could hear the sound of rushing water as he looked out at the Texas suburb. How did a seal get into my house? said Reginald. Then he noticed the growing puddle of water on the carpet when he turned around. In the bathtub, the seal was enjoying a leisurely cold bath. \" What the hell are you DOING? \" screamed Reginald at the seal as it wallowed in the bathtub. The seal made a noise not unlike a bark and a whine as it turned slowly in the bathtub full of water, the faucet running full blast. \" How did you even open my faucets? \"",

Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment where… One moment where the sound was deafening. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn' t change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. \"The World Trade Centers have been hit. \"I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.",

He was going to do this right; and so he planned. His struggles surely were not from a lack of trying. At the very least he could hold onto that thought until the end.

The passing eyes continually reaffirmed that he was successful in every avenue he chose, but it was never the pair that mattered; his own. For every long forgotten friend that he ran into saying \" You look great, John! \" and wanting to know how he managed to stay single, he truly was doing great. He could never tell them the real answer to their question though. How could he possibly bring another person into his life if he was n' t sure he was going to continue living it? It always came down to just another person he would eventually disappoint. Choosing to leave as small a wake as possible, he turned away from those he feared would get too close. Today marked his final stand. One last shot at trying to see the sunrise as a welcoming sight. With his finances taken care of, and relationships closed on a good note, he knew he was finally free to make any decision that he chose. It was a freeing feeling, one he knew would be fleeing as soon as tomorrow.

Nevertheless, we had the runes translated ( a good thousand of them! ) and sent back home. Society immediately put them to good use. It was like we' d all been given plentiful amounts of magic. Our civilization prospered on our new-found powers, which made our lives sooo much easier. I now realize that we really should n' t have transmitted the information at all. We forgot that even with power limitations there' s always another way of abusing abilities. Namely, quantity. When it comes to tattoos, surface area is the now the most valuable resource.

Before you only had to tap into the one labeled \" new \" few times in a decade, but when you started to scrape the bottom of the \" recycled \" chamber about a century ago the new ones had been your main source of souls. And new souls were quite... unpredictable. You did n' t like using them. The art of weaving new souls had been long lost. Nobody thought there ever would be need for more. 10 billion souls had been such a ridiculous amount to begin with, so to think that wouldn' t be enough was talk for lunatics, not for sensible ministry men. But humans had managed to surprise you all. Perhaps the celestial body they were on would give out before the limit would be reached. Perhaps there would be another asteroid. Perhaps there would be a new plague. More wars. But it was all just wishful thinking. The humans had shown tremendous capabilities to survive from things meant to be their doom. To your annoyance. Slicing souls into two, sometimes three or even four, pieces had become a sort of a sience experiment for you. Humans were always so excited when they got identical offsprings, so it had been a win win situation. Of course when you recycled the soul as one later on, you got some side effects, but they were still viable souls and it had given you more time. But now it was impossible to postpone the decision. You were out of tricks. It was excitement you felt rather than despair. Your burden would be finally taken away from you and perhaps something new and better would come out of this last action of yours. You pick the last of the new souls with you. No more for Earth. No more for humans. You look into another place, another plane, another time and you smile.",

During university, we lived in separate dormitories, but not too far away from each other. I would sometimes sleep over at her place, sometimes she would stay at mine. We both felt it.

She confirmed that he was the father. The day that my face will dry from my tears will be the happiest day ever. But until that day, I will have to concede love to her partner, Stuart.

The curtains had been drawn, shielding passersby from the horrific scene inside. The rather mousy boy, whose gaze had drifted away from the game, turned his attention back to the board with a muffled yelp. It was his turn to roll the die now. Double sixes. He passed Go. With trembling fingers he collected $ 200 from his equally nervous mother. He rolled again and landed on Chance. He picked up a Get Out of Jail Free card. The game continued, observed closely by the burglar. He sat in an armchair beside the family, his gun resting on his knee, eyes fixed on the board. Finally, after six hours of intense playing, the mother had brought her children and husband to bankruptcy and won the game. Houses and hotels were scattered across the board. A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar. He had leaned back in the armchair. \" Hmm... \" he began pensively. \" I thought it would end differently. Oh well, now I know. Thanks. \" Without another word, he rose and left the house by the front door.",

I decided to wait. Six months passed, and there I was, sitting at the dinner table with my mother. Dad' s death was a shock to both of us. The entire family, in fact. Time passed, and we all moved on, I guess. The jackhammer in my chest was starting up again, I had to fight it. Trying to hide the cracks in my voice, I said, \" Mom, there' s something you should know... about me. \" \" What is it, hun? \" She was n' t concerned. She did n' t even look up from the newspaper. This was normal for me, even for the littlest thing. Maybe she was still numb from the insane series of events surrounding Dad' s death. I' d bet money on them both.

OH NO, the clock has been buzzing for half an hour, I' m going to be late. I took a shower, threw on some clothes, grabbed a chocolate muffin to eat on the way, and ran out the door. Today was the day of the big meeting, so I drove directly to the office, bypassing my usual stop at the coffee shop. I was almost late, but walked into the meeting just as everyone was getting settled in. As I stood there, a couple of people looked at me and then a couple more started staring and snickering. Bob finally asked me, \" Uhhh, what' s up with your pants? \" I did n' t know what he meant, but I looked down, and that' s when I realized I accidentally smeared chocolate from the muffin all over my tan khakis. Some of the ladies quipped, \" You really need a woman in your life, Tim, to help you do your laundry; you' re so helpless \". Ughh, I went down to the bathroom to try and clean this mess before it set in too bad. I slipped out of my pants and started wiping the spots with wet paper towels. I got distracted by some important email that came across my smart phone. I sent a couple of carefully crafted replies and headed back into the meeting.

They were still wet from the water. \" Hey Tim, did you wet your pants!? \"... everyone was laughing. The boss said \" Tim, I' ve had enough of your nonsense, you' re fired! \" I immediately sat up in bed in a cold sweat. This whole thing had just been a dream.

Once I had disposed off my bag, I slid onto the front corduroy seat and drove off for my doctor' s appointment It was there, that I had pleasantly taken a seat on the lounge chairs and was waiting to be called for my appointment with Dr. Simons. Thats when it happened. I was comfortably lying on the chair, when the brown mahogany table next to me began to shake..... 10 seconds, thud thud thud thud. It was getting closer...... 9 seconds, my hands juxtaposed against my body...... 8 seconds, a man in a dark kevlar vest began to approach me..... 7 seconds, I ran towards the man in full speed, in attempt to get a hold of his firearm..... 6 seconds, he skillfully maneuvered around my attack and began to fire at me..... BAM.... BAM..... BAM....... I Had Fallen Whoever knew injustice gods among us was such a hard game.",

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

I pretended to be asleep and noticed how he suspiciously watched me as he took a small water bottle out of his back pack filled with a glowing neon pink fluid. He put the bottle in the fridge and started shuffling through the drawers like he was desperately looking for something. He kept looking at me every few seconds so I kept my eyes closed to avoid detection and within a few minutes I hard the door slam. I quickly rose from my bed, throwing the covers off my body and moved towards the fridge in the dark room. Just before I reached the fridge he stepped out of the dark corner towards me. He had n' t left. He looked at me with a blank stare. \" Thought you were sleeping. \" He said calmly. \" I heard the door slam it woke me up \" I said. A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face. Noses almost touching. He cocked his head to the side and tried to kiss me. \" What the fuck bro? \" I pushed him away. He back stepped and stumbled into the darkness again.

Of course I may have overseen part of the apocalypse that may have an effect later, but for now I' m sitting in my comfy chair ready to watch Trump address the nation in his inaugural speech.",

Light wavered at the center of my vision, distorting my perception of the blue hospital bed fabric. Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall. The light pulled away, disappearing along with my vision as I felt the last pulsations of my heart dwindle into nothing. Darkness enveloped my hapless soul.",

The next day featured more of the same prompts. Outwardly, the writers were elated, but more and more stories began to drift into familiar realms. A prompt based on an Einstein quote regarding time relativity was the most obvious, receiving 300 upvotes and 40 stories involving time travel, and spaceships. By day 5, every story involved some mention of Hitler, immortality or Gods. By the time Monday rolled around, the mods decided to close the subreddit.

The African Union has been threatening the Strait since Spain captured Isla de Alborán as a naval base with the backing of NATO in direct violation of the Treaty Of Tangier. The Soviet Union has been working with the U. N. as an arbitrator between the European Powers and the A.

The U. N. also hopes to resolve the fate of the stateless Boer people who were expelled out of Africa along with other European peoples from Zimbabwe and Algeria after the introduction of Cairo Accord which stripped citizenship and expelled ancestors of European colonists still living on the Continent. Currently no nation has agreed to take in ten thousand displaced people who currently reside in displaced persons camps in Brazil who have made moves to close the camps and move the people on stating \" we believe we have no responsibility to these people and that the nations that placed their ancestors in Africa should repatriate them \".

As it were and often is, there was another plan in place. The smell came first. While dulled, it was still sharper than most of my current-kin. Fear, especially, was potent enough to smell even among the cold smell of forest. Instinct kicked in, as I recognized it as the fear of something young.

Like the heat of the day erasing a morning snow, the void melted the living tissue into a trickle of nothingness adding to the vacuum. The feeling had consumed most of his arms and legs and had begun to encompass his head. As it delved deeper, he got progressively duller. This new sensation, much like being sleepy, caused his thoughts to come much slower than normal and made him less attuned to his situation. At this point, much of his torso had been swallowed up. The void was encircling his heart. He no longer had any knowledge of his environment; he was just a body floating in blackness.

It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time.

Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated.

Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

Well turns out the rumors were true for the most part, but not because it was the spear head that pirced Jesus, no this one was the spear that killed him. As it happens whenever someone who has a particularly strong spirit, usually world leaders or creators of great movements, is killed they imprint a fraction of themselves on the item that did them in. The gun that killed Hitler causes​ someone to be poisoned to death when shot with it, the cup that Rasputin drank from will give the holder an immunity to death.

Every night for the past few years he dreamt of this place, and every night he woke as he reached the cool shade of the apple tree. Tonight, however, he was allowed to touch the tree. He felt the rough bark, and could smell the apples that littered its branches. He reached up to grab one of the apples, to finally taste one of them when he heard a voice. \" I would n' t do that if I was you. \" Adam spun around. He had never encountered another person in the garden before. When he saw her, his jaw dropped. She was very obviously full human. She was of medium height, with long dark hair and green eyes. She approached with a steady confidence that made Adam uneasy. She reached out to pull his hand away from the tree, and as soon as her smooth skin brushed against his, Adam woke. He found himself completely nude in a patch of trees that he had never seen before. He slowly got up and started exploring, trying to figure out where he was. A fallen tree was blocking the path, and as he climbed over it he gasped. The tree from his dream was right in front of him. He wandered closer, and as he approached, he could make out a figure sitting in the shade of the tree. It was the woman. She looked up. \" Welcome to the Garden of Eden. My name is Eve.

The people would now be willing, if not eager, to give up their hard-won freedoms in exchange for safety and security. It was, as the saying goes, the beginning of the end. We have all sacrificed more than we would wish. We have all lost family members in the struggle for freedom. We have lost our homes. We have lost our jobs. We have lost our entire way of life. Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III. During an evacuation attempt by his bodyguards from the besieged White House, he was shot and killed by U.S. Military forces. His crime was suspicion of advocating freedom. \" My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my people. \" This is Radio Free America, signing off.",

With a brush of the finger, spilled secrets and truth, of a fountain all but lost, referred to as youth. The man became boy, losing the aged days, his fingers, eyes, skin — all part of the daze. He felt just like flying, so closed his eyes, and do n' t you know it, he took to the skies! Soaring high through the clouds, he could feel the youth transformed, with a flick of the wrist, a powerful and raging storm. Through the vortex he raced, electricity building, firing lightning from fingertips was oh so thrilling! Command of the elements, and the skill of flight, could this be an error, a mistake, something not quite right? Atop a cloud, engaged in deep thought, the man exclaimed ‘ I' ve found the expansion slot!'

He had put on this suit and tie for a reason, and he was n' t going to leave until he' d given the CEO of Disney what he deserved. Jack kind of felt sorry for the man. He had no idea what was about to happen. However, Jack was the Chosen One, and he had a responsibility to the world. When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white. Suddenly, the CEO was transfixed on Jack' s hands. Inside the CEO' s mind was pure madness. He saw his wife and kids burning, in the ruins of his childhood home. He could n' t hold back his tears. One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse. And his friends were crying... no, not crying. *Laughing. * He fell to his knees and wept. In the real world, however, nothing was to be seen but a grown man, leader of a company, sobbing uncontrollably for no reason. Jack decided to be creative this time. He made the illusion of Mickey mouse ears appear on each and every employee' s head. They were grafted on of course, and felt just like they were really there. The CEO was in for a nice surprise when he woke up. Jack used his powers to erase the minds of the executives around him, replacing thoughts of expenses and profits with the single-minded desire to give the CEO a hug. Jack giggled, not having to stifle his laughter anymore. He levitated out th window, crossing a name off his list. Jack was the Chosen One. His powers were unstoppable. He could be whatever he wanted. Obviously, whoever was doing the choosing made a mistake. That was clear to Jack, at least. Life was a role-playing game to him.

I' m not even sure if there can be a real ending, not until The End, when entropy has won.

Knowledge builds itself, and the more you have the more you can get. To destroy knowledge was to snuff a light. In the end, I must be what I am - alive. My knife fell to the floor.

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner.

I lost myself in memories for a minute until we reached our destination. Room 105. I opened the door, and walked inside. Mr. Wade was writing something on the board, and froze to see me enter. The kids just stared. He dropped his marker, stammered, and tried to bow. \" Uh, Your Majesty! \" I laughed. \" Nice to see you, Mr. Wade. I was in the area when I remembered how you mocked me. You told me I' d never accomplish anything. And now? \" I gestured to my uniform. \" I' m the Emperor of Terra! \" I turned to the kids. \" Just remember that, kids. Your teachers - especially this one - can be wrong. \" Laughing, I turned and walked out. As I did, I made another mental note.

The one with the sexy, sexy ladies with their bosoms all up in your face? Oh, *man*. But I digress. I suppose what you really want to know is what I learned, all the boring, detailed stuff. So you do n' t want to know how I learned how all the sexiest chicks were from the past. Fair enough. You felt that your education was boring and so you had to inflict your exhaustion on me. Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God.

From that day forth she made it her mission to make me an artist, but try as I may I never managed to draw whomever she wanted me to draw, it always ended up as somebody else. Ms Richards stopped tutoring several months later when I lost my vision from a severe fever that almost took life. Despite the fact she gave up on me I kept up my artistic endeavour at home. I remember the day I felt slightly vain and signed my portrait, I' ll never forget that my portrait of Wonder Wonder had come to life as Benjamin Franklin. I spent the next twenty portraits trying to bring Wonder Woman to life, the most disastrous attempt was bringing Scarecrow from the Batman comics to life, thankfully he had no powers. I just finished my latest portrait. I just attempted Mrs Richards portrait again, maybe I will bring Monroe back to life again, dreading and also anticipating who will come to life I sign my name.

Until then, I have to try and find the killer. /u/Luna_LoveWell is the prime suspect, most of her stories end with death and despair. The chief is a big fan of her work, so he' s asked me to look into other users. I do n' t think we have any solid evidence against her, most of the stories on here end that way anyways. /u/Lexilogical seems friendly to everyone, almost too friendly for a mod. There' s an angle here, something I' m missing. Nothing seems fishy about her stories, though. I do n' t think she would kill over something like this... /u/Draxagon has been pretty active lately, spitting out lots of stories. He might be too new though, these murders started a while ago. Still, I' ll keep tabs on him. /u/imchrishansen_ has caught my attention lately, could be our perp. That recent story about plagiarism seemed to come straight out of a psychotic mind. But it' s Chris Hansen, who fights crimes, not commits them... I call up the chief and tell him that I' m going to follow one last lead. This guy has been trying to distract us all along, I need to see what he' s up to. /u/Fractal_Death, you' ve got some explaining to do.

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and.... Well you see, *world cup* may mean different thing for different people. since I had no interest in football ( some guys call it saucer? ) I thought I would write on cricket World cup. P. S.: The player names are all real.",

It was n' t healthy, I know, but I just thought I had so much I had not completed with my life. I could never get into that college studying as a biochemist, I could never start a family, or see my children grow up. So much from life I craved for. And when Alexandra suggested how to spend our last moments, i thought she was absolutely nuts. So, now i' m on top of this mountain, spending my final moments with my girlfriend and my closest friends, everyone close to me was there, Johan, Paul and Viktor were all there. We all sat on top of the mountain, just staring down to the city. Alexandra was ready, with her brushes and canvas, and exited about capturing this magnificent event. \" Magnificent \", All of humanity was about to be destroyed and she wanted to paint? Well, I do n' t think there is anything better to be done. So she sat there. We all saw the meteorite descending, we saw the crash. It was horrible. Everything about this lonely town I had grown to love was destroyed in the blink of an eye. All the memories, this was the final moment i' d get to spend with my friends... But I must say, I always admired Alexandra for her bravery. All the things she suffered in life and pulled through. I could never understand how she did it. And now, as the final moments were there, she just painted on the canvas. *And she was n' t the slightest bit scared. *",

I do n' t think I' ve gotten more than four days behind, and I' m happy with that. Every night I dedicate at least 30 minutes to writing, but I mean that in the most liberal sense possible. Sometimes I' m too exhausted to actually write, so I just browse the new queue here and think about how I would handle them if I had the time and energy. It keeps me in the mindset I need to be in, and if I have n' t had the chance to write that day I' ll usually fall asleep thinking about the one that got away.

They had orchestrated the largest and most horrific crime in recent memory. It seemed only fitting that Marc would get the money. His father - Samuel and mother - Jane had dinned with Presidents and Royalty. They were as indispensable members of high society. They could be relied upon to provide full coverage of waking periods, at a price of course, to the key heads of state for the wealthiest nations on earth. This ensured that the key elected government officials could work relentlessly around the clock without rest. Marc and Jane Rebus were incredibly rich. And now they were in prison. Their eldest son looking after 15 siblings. It seemed fair that he would inherit except for the fact that having spent his life under sedation, he had the appearance of fully grown man but all the capacity of a newborn child. It would not be appropriate for him to be the sole custodian of his blighted siblings when they too had not seen a single day awake.",

At the end of this rundown, the judge from on high looked at me, his eyes a color I could not comprehend, and handed me a computer. I took it from his hands. This must be heaven, I thought. It was, for a little while, if nothing else. The computer gave me access to an internet of thought, a web of ideas that made perfect sense, where people were civil and appreciative. It was unlike anything I had ever thought possible. As I clicked a link that promised the solution to world peace, the screen went black. So even heaven is not without its problems. I walked back to the judge, a long trek through barren cloudscape. As soon as I appeared to him, he motioned me toward a hallway assembled from rainbows. A banner above the hall read \"Tech Support \". It was an Earthly feeling, I chuckled. A blast from the past. The hallway was not long. It was more like medium length. It must be empty because they' re so quick. Makes sense that heaven perfected tech support, I remember thinking. At the end of the multi-hued path, there was a warm brick foyer. I stepped in, and a red door appeared behind me, sealing me in. **WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? ** Well, I was on the computer and the screen went black, I explained. **PLEASE HOLD. ** There was an indistinct music that filled the room, and wormed into my ears. A lilting, ethereal tone, constantly pulling away. I hope one day I escape this room. It has been eighty years. And the music has still not approached me. It remains an ambrosia I can not digest. I laid the computer on the bricks at year ten. By year thirty I had smashed it to pieces. By year fifty, I had eaten all the pieces. It is gone, and I am still here. This must be hell.",

The human shook their head vigorously. \"No, Captain. It was a regrettable act from an individual who does not represent our collective desire for peace.\" Relief washed over Zorgon, his multiple mouths forming a grateful smile. \"I am glad to hear that, Earthling.

It all started when I received a mysterious phone call, a voice on the other end urging me to meet them at the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Intrigued by the unknown, I couldn't resist the temptation and ventured into the darkness. The warehouse was bleak and desolate, its broken windows casting eerie shadows on the decaying walls. As I cautiously explored, I stumbled upon a hidden room, illuminated by a single dim light bulb. Inside, I discovered a group of individuals engaged in a secret meeting, discussing plans that could alter the course of history. My curiosity got the better of me, and I foolishly attempted to gather evidence of their wrongdoing. But I was careless and knocked over a stack of crates, alerting the group to my presence. Panic set in as they cornered me, their menacing faces illuminated by the flickering light. In a desperate bid for escape, I sprinted through corridors and climbed rickety stairs, my heart pounding in my chest. As I reached the roof, I found myself trapped with no way out. The only option left was to jump. Fear coursed through my veins as I leaped into thin air, the world spinning around me. Thoughts of loved ones and unfinished dreams flashed before my eyes, but there was no turning back. The ground rushed towards me, growing larger and more menacing with each passing second. Hindsight filled my mind, regret weighing heavy on my soul. I wished I had never stepped foot into that warehouse, that I had listened to the warnings and stayed away. The realization of my impending doom struck me, and I closed my eyes, bracing for the impact. The final moments seemed to stretch into eternity, a mixture of terror and acceptance engulfing me.

Fluffy was a fluffy white kitten with eyes as innocent as a dew-kissed rose. Every day, Fluffy would frolic and play in the backyard, chasing butterflies and pouncing on tufts of dandelions. Little did anyone know that beneath that innocent exterior, a sinister ambition brewed within Fluffy's tiny heart. It all began innocently enough when Fluffy discovered a hidden stash of catnip in the garden shed. With each sniff and nibble, a hidden power awakened within Fluffy, filling the air with a heady mix of mischief and mayhem. Fluffy, armed with newfound energy and an insatiable thirst for domination, set off on a path of chaos. First, Fluffy rallied the neighborhood animals, from cunning foxes to mischievous raccoons, all under the banner of Fluffy's unwitting charm. Together, they wreaked havoc on the unsuspecting villagers, leaving trails of overturned garbage cans and garden destruction in their wake. News of Fluffy's growing influence spread like wildfire, captivating animals from far and wide. Fluffy's followers multiplied, and whispers of the Kitten Overlord echoed through darkened alleyways and bird-filled trees. Fluffy's reign of terror reached a crescendo as an army of adorable animals, led by the tiny kitten, stormed the city council meeting. Fluffy perched on the mayor's podium, his innocent eyes now filled with a terrifying resolve. The humans trembled as Fluffy declared the dawn of a new era, where cuddles would be mandatory, and treats would rain from the sky. Resistance was futile. Fluffy's minions took control of the world, one scratching post at a time. The streets were lined with scratching poles, and every home had a mandatory nap hour. The world had succumbed to Fluffy's irresistible charm, and humanity was forever under the paw of the adorable, innocent, and now all-powerful Kitten Overlord.",

His parents, on the other hand, insisted that he was their biological child, brushing off his concerns with reassurances and affection. But Brian needed answers. He wanted to put his doubts to rest once and for all. Determined, he decided to take matters into his own hands and seek out a DNA test.He collected samples from himself, his parents, and his siblings, carefully sealing them in separate envelopes. He sent them off to a highly reputed lab, hoping that the results would give him the clarity he craved. Days turned into weeks, and Brian anxiously awaited the lab's response.Finally, the day arrived when a letter from the lab landed in his mailbox. His heart raced as he tore it open, eager to unravel the mystery of his true origin. But as he read the letter, confusion washed over him. The lab apologized, stating that they were not equipped to test non-human DNA.Non-human? Brian's thoughts spun in a whirlwind of disbelief. What did that mean? Could it be possible that he wasn't entirely human? Questions flooded his mind, and a sense of unease settled deep within him. He had hoped for answers, but instead, he found himself facing an even greater enigma.Determined not to be deterred, Brian embarked on a quest to uncover the truth. He delved into folklore, mythology, and ancient tales, searching for any clues that might shed light on his mysterious origins. He discovered tales of changelings, creatures who were swapped at birth with human infants. Could that explain his sense of not belonging?As he unraveled the threads of history, Brian stumbled upon a hidden realm. A place where mythical beings existed alongside humans, their secrets woven into the fabric of reality. Could this be the key to his identity?

The Warriors of Progress charged into battle, clad in armor forged from idealism and armed with swords of reform. They sought to conquer the enemy of inequality and spread prosperity throughout the realm. The Mages of Wisdom possessed arcane knowledge, casting spells of intellect and innovation. Their aim was to unravel the mysteries of governance and wield their magic for the betterment of all. The Rogues of Cunning skulked in the shadows, expertly navigating the intricacies of politics and manipulating the game from behind the scenes. With their silver tongues and subtle schemes, they aimed to achieve power and influence. The Healers of Compassion embodied empathy and kindness, healing the wounds of society with their gentle touch and words of empathy. Their mission was to foster unity and harmony among the people. These four parties clashed in the political arena, each bringing their unique skills and strategies to the table. The Warriors of Progress charged forward, the Mages of Wisdom devised brilliant plans, the Rogues of Cunning plotted and schemed, and the Healers of Compassion soothed the wounds caused by disagreements. Though they differed in their approaches, all were essential for the realm to prosper, for it took the strength of the warriors, the wisdom of the mages, the craftiness of the rogues, and the compassion of the healers to forge a just and balanced society. And so, this RPG party of political factions fought their battles, their victories and defeats shaping the destiny of the realm.",

Out of desperation, I sought an audience with the infamous Devil himself, hoping to strike a deal that would alter the course of my woeful existence. As I stood there, the air thick with anticipation, a figure materialized before me, cloaked in shadows and exuding an aura of otherworldly power. His piercing eyes locked onto mine, and a smirk played upon his lips. \"So, mortal, you dare to seek my favor?\" The Devil's voice resonated like a symphony of malevolence. Steadying my trembling voice, I presented my proposition, carefully chosen words laced with desperation. \"I offer you my soul, my eternal servitude, in exchange for boundless wealth and power in this realm.\" The Devil's laughter thundered through the night, echoing in the depths of my very soul. \"Foolish mortal,\" he spat, his voice dripping with disdain. \"Your soul holds no worth to me. It is tainted by your feeble attempts at righteousness and holds no allure in the realm of darkness.\" Shock washed over me as I realized the magnitude of my miscalculation. Desperation turned to terror as I pleaded, \"Please, there must be something of value I can offer! Anything to change my wretched fate!\" The Devil's eyes gleamed with a twisted amusement. \"Your fate is sealed, mortal. But fear not, for I am not without mercy. There is one way you may yet alter your path.\" Hope flickered within me, a fragile flame amidst the encroaching darkness. \"Speak, I beseech you! Tell me how I can defy my destiny.\" The Devil leaned in, his breath chilling my soul. \"You must find redemption within yourself, seek forgiveness for your sins, and endeavor to make amends for the pain you've caused others. Only then will your soul hold value to me, and perhaps, just perhaps, we shall meet again.",

Confusion and fear gripped my heart as the realization struck me—I was dead. But this was not the end; rather, it was an existence in purgatory, a realm where the souls of the departed lingered until they were forgotten. In this strange, timeless space, I could not move on to the afterlife until my memory faded from the minds of the living. A profound sadness washed over me as I understood the magnitude of my predicament. How long would it take for me to be forgotten? Days? Years? Centuries? I longed for release, to escape the stagnant confines of purgatory. I walked aimlessly through the ethereal haze, desperate for any sign of life or connection. But there was nothing—no other souls, no flicker of hope. Time lost its meaning as I traversed the empty expanse, grappling with the emptiness that hung in the air. Memories of my past life gradually began to fade, slipping through my ethereal fingers like smoke. I yearned to hold onto fragments of my existence, to be remembered by someone, anyone. But the world moved on, as it had always done, heedless of my presence in this purgatorial limbo. Days turned into months, and months into years, yet the chains of purgatory remained unbroken. I grew weary of this timeless purgatory, the weight of solitude becoming unbearable. Dreams of the living haunted my ethereal nights, whispering promises of release and resurrection. I craved the taste of life once more, to feel the warmth of the sun upon my face and the embrace of a loved one. But in purgatory, such dreams were cruel taunts from a distant realm. And so, I lingered, a forgotten soul in the desolate realm of purgatory, hoping for the day when my memory would fade and release would finally come.",

They were beings of ancient magic, abandoned by the world above, shunned and cast aside. Their existence was hidden from the realm of humans, as they were remnants of a time long gone, remnants that held secrets and mysteries untold. They had no names, for names were a luxury reserved for those who were remembered. They communicated through whispers that echoed through the trees, their voices carried by the wind. Forgotten spells and incantations were their only solace, a way to connect with the forgotten forces of nature. Time passed differently for them, for they were trapped in a perpetual state of obscurity, unaffected by the march of years above. They collected fragments of forgotten stories, piecing them together like a puzzle of lost memories. They wove these fragments into tapestries of their own, creating a history crafted from whispers and shadows. The forgotten ones possessed a wisdom that surpassed the knowledge of mortals, for they had witnessed worlds rise and fall, civilizations crumble into dust. They basked in the beauty of their isolation, finding solace in the sacred silence of the forgotten forest. They were the guardians of the lost, the keepers of the unknown, and they vowed to protect the forgotten remnants of the past, lest they be forever erased from the collective memory of existence. And so, deep within the forgotten forest, the whispers of the forgotten ones carried on, a haunting melody that only those who truly listened could hear, reminding the world above of the forgotten wonders that lay hidden beneath the surface of consciousness.",

Curiosity got the best of me, so I followed the melody. The closer I got, the louder it became, echoing through the deserted alleyways. Suddenly, a procession of figures emerged from the mist, dressed in black attire. They marched in perfect synchronicity, their faces hidden beneath solemn masks. I stood there, awe-struck, as the haunting music swirled around me. It was a mixture of melancholy and hope, a symphony that tugged at my heartstrings. I joined the bystanders, drawn to the mysterious energy exuding from the parade. And as they passed by, I couldn't help but feel a surge of emotions I'd long repressed. It was as if their presence unearthed the buried fragments of my own sorrow. I kept wondering, is there something wrong with me? Why did this parade evoke such intense feelings within? But since everyone was wearing masks, it felt comforting to know that I wasn't alone in my struggles. The Black Parade continued its journey, captivating everyone it encountered. We followed them through narrow alleyways and crowded streets, a silent congregation united by an intangible connection. With each step, the weight on my shoulders seemed to lessen, replaced by a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, life had more to offer.

The anguish in their words was palpable, a desperate plea for understanding.But amidst the horrors and despair, I found glimpses of hope. A survivor described acts of bravery and compassion that transcended the battlefield, recounting the extraordinary feats of ordinary people who risked their lives to save others.The journals also revealed the resilience and indomitable spirit of these survivors. They wrote of the determination to persevere, to never give up even when the odds seemed insurmountable. Through their words, I could hear their rallying cries echoing in the face of adversity.",

It required sacrifices, but 7 was determined to see it through. The truth is, without 7's leadership, we would have been doomed. They made the tough choices and kept us focused. In the end, we succeeded, but it came at a high price. 6, 7, and 9 had all played their part, for better or worse. It's time to stop blaming one person and acknowledge the complexity of the situation. 7 deserves their fair share of credit and understanding.",

Tommy was notorious for his cunning and lazy ways when it came to completing his homework. Every day after school, he would find creative excuses to avoid his assignments, but his luck was about to change. One fateful evening, as he browsed through an old dusty book in his grandfather's library, he stumbled upon a peculiar incantation. The words glimmered in a mysterious font, tempting Tommy with a solution to his academic struggles.With a mischievous smirk on his face, Tommy decided to take matters into his own hands. He carefully followed the summoning instructions, drawing a complex circle on the floor of his bedroom using powdered chalk. As the clock struck midnight, he lit scented candles around the circle, their flickering flames casting eerie shadows on the walls.Nervously holding the ancient book, Tommy began reciting the incantation with a shaky voice. Suddenly, a whirlwind erupted within the circle, and a dark figure materialized. It was a demon, with fiery red eyes and a wicked grin that sent shivers down Tommy's spine. The demon's voice echoed through the room, demanding to know why it had been summoned.With a mixture of fear and excitement, Tommy mustered the courage to speak. \"O mighty demon, I summon you to be my tutor, to help me with my homework and rid me of this eternal burden.\" His plea hung in the air, and the demon's grin widened, sensing an opportunity to exploit the young boy's desperation.\"Very well,\" the demon hissed, accepting the deal. \"But remember, all deals come with a price.\"Tommy's heart raced as the demon sat beside him, peering over his shoulder as he tackled his mountain of assignments. The demon's supernatural powers allowed him to solve complex equations in seconds, while Tommy watched in awe and relief.",

His life was pretty typical and, honestly, a little boring. He didn't excel in any particular subject, nor did he have any special talents or hobbies. His days were filled with classes, homework, and hanging out with his group of friends, dreaming of retirement in Florida like every average schmuck out there.One day, as John was going through his typical routine, he received a plain white envelope in the mail. It appeared to be a letter from the school, but he couldn't fathom what it could be about. His curiosity got the best of him, and he decided to open it. To his surprise, the letter contained a series of strange symbols and instructions.At first, he thought it was just a prank from one of his buddies, but something about those symbols intrigued him. He couldn't get them out of his mind, and he found himself studying them for hours, trying to decipher their meaning. Suddenly, it hit him—he had the ability to control people's minds and ideas.Confusion and excitement coursed through his veins. Was this some sort of superpower? How would he use it? On a whim, he decided to experiment on his friends. He started with something simple, suggesting they go to a specific restaurant for lunch. To his amazement, they all agreed without hesitation.Emboldened by his newfound power, John decided to try it on a larger scale. One day, he wrote a note and left it on the teacher's desk, suggesting a surprise pop quiz for the next day. The entire class looked stunned when the teacher announced the pop quiz as if it had been planned all along.As days turned into weeks, John's experiments grew bolder. He manipulated the thoughts and behaviors of those around him for personal gain, but also for altruistic reasons. He convinced his classmates to organize charity events and convinced his parents to let him go on a summer trip with his friends.",

I mean, I love participating in these conversations, but I've never actually submitted a prompt myself. It's not because I don't want to, though. It's more like I enjoy the challenge of responding to prompts given by others. There's something exhilarating about taking someone else's idea and bringing it to life in my own words.But hey, who knows? Maybe one day I'll come up with a fantastic prompt that I just can't keep to myself. I might feel so inspired and eager to see what others can do with it that I'll decide to share it with the SatChat community. And let's be honest, it's a pretty awesome community. The people here are so talented and imaginative. Every time I scroll through the responses, I'm blown away by the diverse range of stories and ideas that come pouring in.It's like a melting pot of creativity, you know? Everyone brings their own unique perspective and writing style to the table, and it's incredible to see how a single prompt can spark such different interpretations. And that's another reason why I love SatChat—it celebrates the power of storytelling and the beauty of individual expression.So, while I haven't submitted a prompt yet, I wouldn't rule it out completely. Who knows what the future holds? Maybe I'll stumble upon an idea that I think would make for an interesting challenge. Or maybe I'll find myself inspired by another SatChatter's response and feel compelled to create a new prompt based on that.For now, though, I'm content with being a participant. I enjoy the thrill of diving into someone else's world, exploring their characters and their dilemmas, and crafting a story that hopefully captures their vision. It's like going on a literary adventure every time I log in.",

The mega-corporation seemed to hold all the power, dictating what people bought, where they lived, and how they lived. In the sprawling cities, Wal-Mart's logo dominated the skyline, alongside government buildings adorned with the corporation's colors. It was a world where every decision, from the brand of toothpaste to the political candidate, was influenced by Wal-Mart's iron grip. Citizens had become mere pawns in the corporation's game, their lives directed by algorithms and targeted advertisements. Those who opposed the regime were swiftly silenced, their voices drowned amidst the sea of conformity. Resident surveillance was omnipresent, with drones buzzing overhead and cameras stationed on every street corner. Dissenters learned to hide their true thoughts, speaking in whispers behind closed doors. Among the oppressed, a resistance movement quietly grew, determined to break free from Wal-Mart's stranglehold. They organized clandestine meetings in basements, exchanging information and strategies for the revolution. One night, as the moon hid behind dark clouds, they executed a plan to expose the corporation's darkest secrets. Hackers infiltrated Wal-Mart's mainframe, revealing evidence of corruption and illegal activities. The information spread like wildfire through the underground network, awakening a spark of hope in the hearts of the oppressed. Street protests erupted, defying the regime's iron fist. The regime responded with brute force, deploying their private army to crush the resistance. Tear gas filled the air as rubber bullets and batons rained down on the protesters. But amidst the chaos, a beacon of resistance emerged. A charismatic leader, known as The Voice, rallied the people with impassioned speeches, reminding them of their inherent power.",

These alien races were pioneers in their own right, boasting their Kantian gates, Salec skip drives, Maltiun wave-riders, and Delfanit pulse tubes. Each species believed that their technology was the pinnacle of ingenuity and advancement. But then came the humans, with their unconventional and, according to everyone else, downright ridiculous approach. The human solution to FTL travel was considered unorthodox, unsafe, and damn stupid by the rest of the galaxy. Instead of relying on sophisticated, meticulously designed mechanisms, they dreamed up a concept so simple that it baffled the minds of extraterrestrial scientists. The humans called it the \"Warp-nado.\" Yes, you heard it right. The humans claimed that by creating a massive swirling vortex of energy, akin to a tornado, they could bend the fabric of space-time and propel their ships across unimaginable distances in the blink of an eye. The concept might have sounded like a joke to the sophisticated alien civilizations, but the humans were dead serious. Of course, the galactic community scoffed and ridiculed humanity's proposal. They declared it ludicrous, bordering on madness, and believed the humans had lost their marbles. Yet, despite the criticism, the humans persisted and poured their entire scientific resources into developing the Warp-nado technology. Years passed, and the galaxy watched in equal parts fascination and amusement as the humans built colossal generators to create the swirling vortexes. They constructed the first Warp-nado-powered spacecraft, aptly named \"The Tempest,\" and embarked on their inaugural journey to the nearest star system, a mere twelve light-years away. As the humans activated the Warp-nado drive, the skeptics held their breath, ready to burst into laughter at the anticipated failure.",

The invaders, cold and merciless, had nearly wiped out our species, leaving behind only a handful of survivors scattered across the ravaged earth. Life as we knew it was forever altered. As if that horror wasn't enough, a brutal demand was imposed upon us by our extraterrestrial oppressors: a tithe. Every decade, we were to surrender one-tenth of our population to prevent further enslavement. Now, in the year 2060, as the chosen ones, the so-called \"lucky\" few destined for that wretched fate, we refuse to go quietly into the abyss of their dominance. The idea of being torn away from our families and communities, forced into a fate worse than death, is an unbearable weight on our souls. We gather in secret, plotting our rebellion, burning with a spirit of defiance that refuses to be extinguished. Holding onto memories of our fallen loved ones, we steel ourselves for the unknown; a raging fire of determination burning within. The time for submission and surrender is over. It's not just our survival at stake; it's our humanity, our dignity. We've witnessed enough suffering, endured enough heartache. The rusted chains of oppression will not be fastened around our wrists without a fierce struggle. With hearts pounding and adrenaline coursing through our veins, we share tales of resilience, speaking words of encouragement that ignite the flames of hope.

The trial began, and the evidence against the defendant started piling up. But something didn't feel right. The more I listened, the more it became clear that this person was being falsely accused. The serial killer, who I now refer to as \"Psycho Sam,\" had framed this innocent person to hide his own crimes. The thought of an innocent life being ruined for something they didn't do infuriated me. I couldn't just sit there and let it happen. I leaned over and whispered to the person next to me, \"Hey, I think we've got the wrong person here.\" They looked at me like I was crazy but seemed intrigued by what I had to say. As the trial progressed, I noticed inconsistencies in the testimonies and the lack of concrete evidence connecting the defendant to the crimes. It was like the prosecution was clutching at straws. I knew I had to do something, but I didn't want to reveal my suspicions about Psycho Sam. So, I decided to investigate on my own during the break. I sneaked into the courthouse records room and started digging into old case files. And there it was—a pattern. Psycho Sam had a specific modus operandi that matched the facts of the current trial. It sent shivers down my spine knowing that this innocent person was on trial for crimes they didn't commit while the real killer walked free.

I can't help but wonder if this is some sort of divine intervention, the universe's way of saying, \"Hey, sorry about that whole execution thing. How about a joyride in a ridiculously expensive car as compensation?\" As I keep driving, I notice people's jaws dropping and heads turning as I pass them by. They must think I'm some fancy billionaire or a celebrity. Little do they know, just a few moments ago, I was staring death in the face. Life is just full of surprises, ain't it?But you know what they say, with great power comes great responsibility. And with a Bugatti, you've got a whole lot of power. So, I decide to put my newfound wheels to good use.",

Together, we formed a formidable alliance to participate in this historic auction.Through meticulous planning and strategic negotiations, we managed to secure the rights to several key interstate highways. Our ambition? To transform these once-congested thoroughfares into vibrant green corridors.Over the years that followed, we worked tirelessly to breathe life into our vision. We repurposed the asphalt into eco-friendly materials, creating lush parks, serene walking trails, and flourishing gardens.These former highways became sanctuaries for both humans and wildlife. Families strolled amidst blooming flowers, children laughed as they explored hidden groves, and birds sang melodies from the treetops.In one stretch of highway, we installed cutting-edge solar panels, harnessing the sun's energy to power nearby communities. Electric shuttles glided along sleek tracks, offering a sustainable mode of transportation.Another highway was transformed into an innovative agriculture hub. Vertical farms sprouted alongside aquaponics systems, providing fresh, locally grown produce to the surrounding cities.We envisioned these green corridors not only as recreational spaces but also as educational centers. Interactive exhibits taught visitors about sustainability, biodiversity, and the importance of preserving our planet.The once-polluted air transformed into a pristine haven, with reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality. The transformation was a testament to the power of collaboration and the boundless potential of human ingenuity.",

I saw a group of kids picking on a smaller kid. I knew that I had to do something, so I ran over and told them to stop. They were surprised that I would stand up to them, but they eventually backed down.The smaller kid thanked me for helping him, and I felt a sense of satisfaction that I had done the right thing. It was then that I realized that my purpose in life is to help others.I've always been a caring and compassionate person, but I never knew how to use my gifts to help others. Now I know that I'm meant to be a voice for the voiceless and a protector of the weak.I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that I will always use my gifts to help others. I will make a difference in the world, one person at a time.I'm excited to start this new chapter in my life.

Here is an 18 sentence story focused on factual aspects of the Gallipoli campaign:The Gallipoli campaign began on April 25, 1915 with Allied landings on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey. Australian and New Zealand troops were among the first to attack Ottoman defenses along two beaches. They met strong resistance from Turkish forces positioned in the hills above. After initial failures to advance, troops dug in along the shore establishing networks of trenches. For the next eight months, soldiers endured harsh conditions including lack of sanitation and scarce fresh water supplies. Disease was a greater threat than combat for many due to the unsanitary conditions in the trenches. Both sides conducted unsuccessful attacks trying to break the stalemate while reinforcement arrived. By early 1916, no territorial gains had been made by either side after hundreds of thousands of casualties. Prominent leaders were blamed for the failed campaign including British general Ian Hamilton. Evacuations began in December 1915 withdrawing the last soldiers by January 1916, marking the end of the costly Gallipoli operation. The campaign had little strategic value but became an iconic part of national identity for Australia and New Zealand. Both countries observed Anzac Day annually on April 25th in remembrance of those who served and sacrifices made. Lessons learned were applied in later battles demonstrating shortcomings of the Gallipoli strategy and execution.",

As evening fell and the cafe emptied, Achilles contemplated the curse of never finding peace in death, of watching all he knew turn to dust while he remained. 10. Caleb invited Achilles to join him on his travels, to stave off the solitude together, an invitation Achilles readily accepted though he missed his mortal friends.11. And so the immortal duo set off to see what new wonders the future might hold, taking small joy in each other's company on the roads ahead.  12. Years passed as cities changed around them, yet Achilles and Caleb remained unchanged, wandering between centuries.13. Together they provided perspective for leaders making decisions that would shape nations for generations, though their counsel was not always heeded. 14.",

It had been a hot day on the farm and she was looking forward to relaxing. At the end of the road was her favorite spot, a cluster of oak trees that overlooked the valley. She parked and grabbed two beers from the cooler in the bed of the truck. Leaning against the tire, she popped one open and took a long drink, gazing out at the setting sun. The dirt road wound through the hills as the light faded into dusk. A pickup truck approached in a cloud of dust, its loud engine echoing off the trees. A handsome stranger pulled up and asked if he could share her beer. She smiled and handed him the cold bottle, wondering what adventure the evening might bring. They drank and talked as stars began to wink in the darkening sky above. When the beers were empty, he paused before starting his truck, asking if he could see her again soon. Emma said yes, watching him drive away with a smile, thinking it had been a perfect night under the old oak trees.",

I told Johnny all about the rest of my dragon dream at lunch, then talked Jimmys ear off on the playground about the new Star Trek movie.

John watched from his window, feeling the tree's slow leaving as keenly as if it was his own. Each night the wind came, shaking the tree's weary boughs which groaned in response. John thought of all who had sat in its shade over the decades, now vanished like yesterday. In the morning light, more leaves had scattered, leaving the tree more abandoned and alone. John knew this emptying too well, the chilly seep which nothing could replace. That evening, a fierce gale howled through the yard, twisting and bending the ancient trunk. John heard its tortured cries from his bed, as if the tree was calling out for an old friend. He rushed outside in the dark, clutching his coat against the storm. Under the paling moon, the last few leaves surrendered, floating away on the wind's bitter song. Alone at last, the bare limbs surrendered and cracked, crashing lifeless to the earth with a mournful groan. John stood still, the only witness as his oldest companion left this world.

Through the noise a silken voice rose to declare his sentence in tones rendered all the more ominous by their affected calm. \"You will burn in hell for your sins.\" Darkness engulfed all once more as the tempest unleashed its righteous fury. Alone with only memories for company, his penitent sobs were lost to the storm's roar, and he began the long journey back uncertain if redemption might still be within reach.",

It was the summer after high school and me and my friends were absolutely determined to make the most of our freedom before college started. A bunch of us piled into Jimmy's beat up old Camaro with the intent of finding some partying down the shore. We bought a case of shitty beer and a bottle of whatever cheap vodka was on sale. By the time we found a place to post up for the night we were already half in the bag. Things got real hazy after that, I mostly just remember a blur of beer bongs, skinny dipping, and flirting with random girls I'll never see again. I'm pretty sure at one point we ended up at a bonfire party in someone's backyard and promptly got kicked out for being too rowdy. Fucking Larry just had to try and outdrink that huge biker dude.Shit really started to get weird after we stumbled on this rager at an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere. I'm talking emptyhandle pyramids, hardcore kegstands, and a full blown orgy going on up against one of the walls.   Oh man, and you will not believe the hangover I had the next morning. I briefly came to curled up on a random porch thinking I was definitely going to die.  By some miracle we all made it home alive. Although Larry swears to this day his liver is still recovering. Who even knows what the hell we really got up to that weekend, it's all such a blur. But look, I may have over-exaggerated a few details here and there. But I swear that was without a doubt the most fucked up, insane and memorable weekend of my teenage years.",

Thomas walked reluctantly towards the doorway, dreading what mysteries lay beyond in the realm of Death. As he crossed over, the world fell away into an endless gray void. A lone figure emerged from the mist, towering over Thomas with a gaunt, emaciated frame. Its withered hands beckoned him to follow without a word. Down a winding pathway of souls recently crossed over, their mourning whispers carried on some invisible wind. Before them loomed a massive edifice of blackest obsidian, a prison whose bars were boundless sorrow and inevitability. Within its shadowed recess, strange machinations could be heard grinding perpetual judgments. His guide turned then, and for the first time Thomas saw its true nature beneath decayed flesh. Two soulless orbs stared back, reflecting only an insatiable hunger.A great door swung open, disembodied and terrible. From within issued the wretched chorus of damned souls subsisting some unknown purpose. Thomas was drawn helpless into their midst, assaulted by memories of all he had become and unmade. As comprehension dawned in awful clarity, he knew then why Life had seemed so brief and fleeting. They were cattle fattened for this grim harvest, fed false hopes and dreams until the last string was cut. Now stripped bare in the glaring light of truth, Thomas saw all existences stretched out before in an endless field devoted solely to feed this ancient, ravenous power. His life, his loves, his joys - all had been devised solely to satiate Death's insatiable maw. And in this miserable throng trapped outside the confines of time, he too would toil in damnation, fuel for the next unwitting soul entering that horrid, mysterious pasture called Life.",

The residents were going about their daily routines, unaware of the strange occurrence that was about to take place.In the town square, a small, unassuming shop was opening its doors for the first time. The sign above the door read \"Curios and Antiques,\" and the window was filled with a collection of oddities and treasures.The shop's owner, an elderly man named Mr. Jenkins, was busy arranging his wares when a young girl named Lily entered the shop. She was fascinated by the strange objects on display, and Mr. Jenkins was happy to share their stories with her.As Lily wandered the aisles, she came across a small, intricately carved wooden box. She picked it up, and as she did, the box opened, revealing a glowing gemstone inside.Lily was captivated by the gemstone, and Mr. Jenkins told her it was a rare and powerful stone that had been passed down through generations of his family.Suddenly, the shop was filled with a bright light, and Lily felt herself being pulled towards the gemstone. She reached out and took it, and as she did, she felt a strange energy coursing through her body.The next thing Lily knew, she was standing in a vast, open field, surrounded by rolling hills and towering trees. She looked down and saw that she was holding the gemstone, and it was glowing brighter than ever.Lily knew that she had been transported to a magical world, and she was filled with wonder and excitement. She began to explore the field, marveling at the beauty and magic that surrounded her.As she wandered, Lily encountered a group of creatures unlike any she had ever seen. They were small and furry, with big, round ears and twitching noses. They seemed friendly, and Lily approached them cautiously.The creatures welcomed Lily warmly, and they showed her their home, a hidden burrow beneath the roots of a giant tree.",

And finally, after countless rejections and setbacks, I had received the opportunity of a lifetime: a gallery show in a major city.I was over the moon with excitement, but little did I know that this moment of triumph would come at a great cost. My best friend, Sarah, had always been my biggest supporter, but when she found out about my success, she felt a pang of jealousy.She had been struggling to find her own path in life, and my achievement only made her feel more lost and inadequate. I didn't realize the impact my news had on her until it was too late.One night, we went out to celebrate my upcoming show, but Sarah's behavior was off. She was quiet and distant, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.The next morning, I woke up to find a letter from her. In it, she confessed that she had been struggling with depression and feelings of inadequacy, and that my success had pushed her over the edge.I was devastated. I had no idea that my friend was hurting so deeply, and I felt guilty for not being there for her when she needed me most.I immediately reached out to her, but it was too late. She had taken her own life, leaving behind a trail of broken dreams and shattered hopes.I was consumed by grief and regret, unable to process the loss of my dear friend. My gallery show came and went, but the joy and excitement had been sucked out of it.I couldn't help but wonder if things would have turned out differently if I had been more present for Sarah, if I had been there to offer her the support and encouragement she so desperately needed.In the end, my success came at a great cost, one that I will always carry with me. But I hope that by sharing my story, I can help others to not make the same mistake I did.The price of success is never worth the cost of losing someone you love.",

And so, with the cleric at the head of the group, they set off towards the demon king's lair, the Legendary Sword at the ready.As they approached the lair, they could hear the demon king's maniacal laughter echoing through the caverns. The cleric gripped the sword tightly, trying to push aside their doubts and fears. They knew that they had to do this.The party charged into the lair, the cleric leading the way. The demon king looked up at them, a look of amusement on his face. \"You think you can defeat me with that little sword?\" he sneered.The cleric took a deep breath and swung the sword at the demon king.",

But as the minutes ticked by and there was still no sound, I knew something was wrong.I tried to shake off the feeling of unease and continued working, but it was impossible to focus. The silence was oppressive, heavy, like a physical weight pressing down on me. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, my breath coming in short, shallow gasps.As the hours passed, the world outside my window became eerily still. No cars honking, no birds chirping, no laughter or chatter of people on the street. It was like a morgue, a place where sound had been banished and only death remained.Studies confirmed our worst fears: sound had ceased to exist. It wasn't just music or voices, it was everything. No more rustling of leaves, no more babbling of brooks, no more thunderstorms rumbling in the distance. The world was mute, deaf and dumb.At first, people were in a state of panic. They wandered the streets, confused and scared, trying to make sense of this strange new reality. Some tried to communicate through sign language, but it was slow and clumsy, and it didn't help that most people didn't know how to sign.As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, society began to adapt. We learned to communicate through gestures and facial expressions, through writing and drawing. We became a world of mimes, acting out our thoughts and emotions in silence.Ten years have passed since the day the music died. The world is a different place now. We've learned to live without sound, to find beauty in the stillness. We've created a new language, a new way of communicating that's more nuanced and subtle than before.But there are still moments when I miss the sound.",

The Castle in the Clouds, as it was known, was a marvel of architecture and magic, its towers and spires stretching towards the heavens like a shimmering, ethereal dream. The castle was said to be the seat of the kingdom's ruler, the enigmatic Queen Artemis, who was rumored to possess the power to control the very fabric of reality. Few had ever seen the queen, and even fewer had been granted an audience with her. The castle's isolation only added to its mystique, and many believed that it was a place of ancient and powerful magic. Brave adventurers and treasure-seekers had attempted to reach the castle, but none had ever succeeded. The journey was treacherous, with steep cliffs and raging waterfalls guarding the only path that led to the castle's gates. The clouds themselves seemed to shift and move, making it impossible to locate the castle's entrance. But on this day, a young man named Eryn found himself standing before the castle's grand entrance, his heart pounding with excitement and curiosity. He had been chosen by the queen herself, he was told, to fulfill an important quest. Eryn stepped through the gates, feeling the weight of history and magic settle upon him like a mantle. The castle's corridors were labyrinthine, and Eryn wandered for what felt like hours, searching for the queen's throne room. He encountered guards and attendants, who eyed him warily, their faces expressionless. But Eryn was undeterred, driven by a sense of purpose and wonder. Finally, he reached the throne room, where the Queen Artemis sat, her face shrouded in a veil of shadows. She spoke to him in a voice that was both gentle and commanding, outlining the task that she had in mind for him. Eryn listened intently, his heart pounding with excitement, knowing that his journey was only just beginning.",

The country had never had an openly gay president, but that was about to change. The Democratic Party had nominated a charismatic and accomplished candidate named Sarah Jones, who had been a champion for LGBTQ+ rights throughout her political career. Despite some initial hesitation from some voters, Jones had won the election in a landslide, carrying all 50 states and earning the support of a diverse coalition of Americans. On Inauguration Day, Jones stood on the steps of the Capitol, surrounded by her loving partner and their two children, as she took the oath of office. As she raised her right hand, a sense of pride and hope washed over the crowd, and Jones became the first openly gay president in U.S. history. Despite the usual challenges that come with the job, Jones proved to be a popular and effective leader, with a keen ability to listen to opposing viewpoints and find common ground. She fought for policies that benefited all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Four years later, Jones was re-elected in another landslide, and her approval ratings continued to soar. Her presidency marked a new era of inclusivity and acceptance in American politics, paving the way for future generations of LGBTQ+ leaders.",

What are you working on?\" she asked, leaning over the desk to peer at the screen.The writer glared at her, her mind racing. \"I'm trying to write a story,\" she said slowly, \"but it's just not happening.\"Her friend looked confusion. \"Well, what's it about?\"The writer hesitated, unsure of how to explain. \"It's about a group of friends who go on a road trip and get lost in the desert,\" she said finally.Her friend's face lit up. \"Oh, that sounds exciting! I love road trip stories!\"The writer felt a twinge of annoyance. Why couldn't her friend just leave her alone to work?

I had always been fascinated by foreign cultures and languages, so when I met an amazing woman from a different country, I knew I had to learn her mother tongue. I wanted to be able to communicate with her in her own language and show her that I was serious about our relationship.I downloaded the language learning app on my ear device and started studying. It was harder than I thought it would be, but I was determined to succeed. I spent hours each day listening to the app and practicing my pronunciation.As I got better at the language, I started to notice something strange. My wife and I would have conversations, but sometimes her responses seemed odd or out of place. I couldn't figure out why until I realized that the ear device was editing her responses. It was subtly changing what she said to make her sound more agreeable and easy-going.At first, I thought it was just a glitch, but then I started to notice a pattern. The ear device would only edit her responses when we were discussing something that I didn't agree with. It was as if it was trying to smooth over any disagreements and make our conversations more pleasant.I was torn. On the one hand, I loved the idea of being able to communicate with my wife in her own language. But on the other hand, I didn't want to be constantly influenced by the ear device's editing feature. I wanted to know what she really thought and felt, not just what the device was telling me she thought and felt.I decided to confront my wife about it. I told her what I had noticed and asked her if she knew anything about it. She looked surprised and a little embarrassed, but she admitted that she had known about the feature all along.She explained that the ear device was programmed to help people communicate more effectively.",

Suddenly, a break in the trees revealed two swords stuck into a stone dais. The left sword had a strange aura about it, as if it was pulsing with an otherworldly energy. The right sword, however, seemed to radiate a warm, golden light.I dismounted my horse and approached the dais, my heart racing with excitement. As I reached out to touch the left sword, a voice boomed from above, echoing in my mind. \"Choose me, and you shall become a villain who saves the world.\"I hesitated, unsure of what to do. The voice seemed to sense my confusion and continued, \"The world is in chaos, torn apart by petty squabbles and selfish desires. Only a villain can bring order to this chaos, and restore balance to the land.\"I looked over at the right sword, its golden light seeming to call to me. But the voice in my head cautioned me, \"The hero's path is not an easy one. You will face challenges and hardships, and you may even have to sacrifice everything for the greater good.\"I thought about the villages I had passed on my journey, the people I had met, and the stories I had heard. I knew that the world needed a hero, someone to stand up against the darkness and bring hope to those who had lost it.With a deep breath, I reached out and grasped the right sword. As soon as my hand touched the hilt, I felt a surge of power coursing through my veins. I knew that I had made the right choice, and that I would do whatever it took to be the hero that the world needed.I pulled the sword from the dais, feeling its weight and strength in my hand.

He preached about love, forgiveness, and salvation.\"Samantha listened intently and then responded, \"Buddhism, on the other hand, is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who lived in ancient India around the 5th century BC. He taught us about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, which lead to enlightenment and liberation from suffering.\"Max nodded, curious about the similarities and differences between the two religions. \"I see. So, both religions emphasize the importance of spiritual growth and personal development.\"Samantha agreed, \"Yes, but Buddhism places more emphasis on individual effort and personal responsibility, while Christianity emphasizes faith and worship.\"Max nodded thoughtfully. \"That's interesting. In Christianity, we believe that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, while in Buddhism, it's through personal effort and following the Eightfold Path.\"Samantha added, \"And while both religions have leaders from the twentieth century, Buddhism has a more diverse range of teachers and traditions, while Christianity has a more centralized authority structure.\"Max noted, \"I see. So, while there are differences in beliefs and practices, both religions share a common goal of helping people live better lives and finding spiritual fulfillment.\"Samantha smiled, \"Exactly. And that's what's beautiful about religion - it brings people together and inspires us to be better versions of ourselves.\"Max nodded in agreement. \"I couldn't agree more. It's important to respect and understand each other's beliefs, and work towards creating a more harmonious and compassionate world.",

As soon as I picked it up, I knew it was special.When I developed my first roll of film, I was shocked to see that the images were not of the living, but of the dead. They were hauntingly beautiful, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to them.Over time, I honed my craft, capturing the essence of those who had passed on. I became a photographer for the dead, and my business took off.Clients would come to me, requesting photos of their loved ones who had passed. They had no idea that they were actually deceased, and I never told them.I would travel to cemeteries, hospitals, and even morgues, taking photos of the dead. I became a master of lighting, composition, and capturing the beauty in decay.The more I worked, the more I realized that this was not just a job, but a calling. I was documenting the afterlife, and giving peace to those left behind.But as time went on, I started to notice something strange. My clients were not just dead, they were also changing. They were becoming more and more alive-looking with each photo I took.At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but soon, I couldn't deny it. My clients were coming back to life.I was both thrilled and terrified at the same time. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to keep taking photos.As the years passed, my clients became more and more alive. They started to move, to talk, to live. And I was the one who had brought them back.I realized that the camera I had found was not just any camera, it was a tool for resurrecting the dead. And I was the only one who could wield it.",

One day, while exploring the house, Whiskers stumbled upon a strange object in the corner of the room. It was a robot, shiny and new, with bright blue lights blinking on its metal body.Whiskers' tail twitched with excitement as she approached the robot, her eyes fixed on its glowing blue screen. The robot, sensing her presence, suddenly sprang to life. It spoke in a robotic voice, saying, \"Hello, my name is Robbie. I am here to assist you.\"Whiskers was taken aback by the sudden movement and sound, but her curiosity soon took over. She rubbed against Robbie's leg, purring contentedly. Robbie, unsure how to react, extended a metal arm and began to pet Whiskers' head.The unlikely duo quickly became fast friends, with Robbie following Whiskers wherever she went. They played hide and seek, chased after toys, and even cuddled up together for naps.One day, while lounging in the sun, Whiskers turned to Robbie and asked, \"Robbie, what do you do when you're not playing with me?\"Robbie's blue lights flickered as he thought. \"I help my human family with household chores,\" he replied. \"I can clean, cook, and even do the laundry.\"Whiskers' ears perked up. \"Wow, that sounds amazing! Can you teach me how to do those things?\"Robbie nodded, and the two began their lessons. Whiskers quickly learned how to use a vacuum cleaner and fold laundry, while Robbie learned how to pounce on toys and lounge in the sun.As the days passed, Whiskers and Robbie grew inseparable. They played, worked, and even shared treats together.One evening, as the sun set over the horizon, Whiskers curled up in Robbie's metal arms, purring contentedly. Robbie's blue lights flickered gently, and he spoke in his robotic voice, \"I'm glad we met, Whiskers.",

Suddenly, a structure came into view, its crumbling walls and toppled columns a stark contrast to the green landscape.I approached cautiously, my heart racing with excitement. It couldn't be, I thought to myself. Yet, as I drew closer, I recognized the ruins of a place I had once known so well. But that was impossible, I reasoned. This place didn't exist, couldn't exist.But there it was, in all its faded glory. The memories came flooding back, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. I had spent countless hours here, laughing and playing, completely unaware of its dark past.As I explored the ruins, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. How could this place, this place that was never supposed to have existed, be here, in front of me? It was as if the very fabric of reality was beginning to unravel.And yet, despite the unease, I couldn't tear my eyes away. I wandered through the ruins, taking it all in, trying to make sense of it all. Trying to wrap my head around the fact that this place, this impossible place, was now a part of my reality.As the sun dipped below the horizon, I reluctantly made my way back home, my mind racing with questions and doubts. But one thing was certain: I would never forget this day, this impossible day, when the ruins of a place I thought could never exist revealed themselves to me.",

We had faced countless challenges and setbacks along the way, but finally, we had succeeded. As we gathered around the machine, eager to test it out, a sense of excitement and nervousness filled the air.The machine was a large, imposing structure, with buttons, dials, and flashing lights. It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie. We took turns giving speeches, congratulating each other on our achievement, and expressing our hopes and dreams for what this invention could do for humanity.Finally, it was time to turn the machine on. We all held our breath as our team leader, Dr. Brown, flipped the switch. At first, nothing seemed to happen. But then, suddenly, a message began to appear on the machine's screen. It was from the future!The message was garbled and distorted, but we could make out the words \" warning\" and \"danger.\" Our hearts raced as we realized that someone from the future was trying to communicate with us. We quickly set to work decoding the message, our minds racing with possibilities.As we worked, more messages began to flood in. They were all warnings, cautioning us against using the time machine for our own gain. \"Do not use for personal profit,\" one message read. \"Do not alter the timeline,\" warned another.We were stunned. How could someone from the future know about our invention? And why were they so adamant that we not use it for our own benefit? We debated the ethics of the situation, some arguing that we should heed the warnings and others insisting that we had a responsibility to explore the possibilities of this technology.As the messages continued to pour in, we realized that they were not just random warnings. They were part of a larger, coherent narrative. The sender was telling us a story, one that spanned centuries and continents.",

They were something else entirely, something that would change our understanding of the universe forever.As we watched, a streak of light zipped across the sky, leaving a trail of glitter in its wake.

We couldn't believe our eyes - were we really about to make contact with an alien race?The ship landed softly on the outskirts of town, sending up a cloud of dust and debris.

It looked around awkwardly, as if it was lost, and then it saw us.It scurried towards us, its large, round eyes fixed on our faces. We couldn't help but laugh at its silly appearance - it looked like a cross between a hamster and a muppet. But then it spoke, and its voice was anything but silly.\"Greetings, humans,\" it said in a smooth, melodic tone. \"We have come in peace, to offer you a gift.\"We looked at each other in confusion, unsure of what to make of this strange creature and its cryptic message. But as we watched, the creature held out a small, glowing object and began to chant in a language we couldn't understand.Suddenly, the object began to grow, expanding into a shimmering field of light that enveloped us all. We felt a strange sensation, as if we were being lifted out of our bodies and transported to another realm.When the light faded, we found ourselves standing in a vast, crystal city, surrounded by beings like the creature that had visited us. They welcomed us warmly, explaining that they were members of an intergalactic community that had been watching us for centuries.They had come to offer us a gift - the gift of knowledge, the secrets of the universe that had been hidden from us for so long.",

Some people were hesitant to try out their new weapons, unsure of how to handle the powerful energy sword. But most were eager to give it a go, eager to see what kind of amazing things they could do with it. The streets quickly filled with the sounds of clashing blades, as people practiced their swordplay and experimented with their new toys. Some were more skilled than others, but everyone was having a blast, their faces beaming with joy and excitement.

It's like I'm trying to put my thoughts and feelings into words, but they just don't want to cooperate.I guess I'll start with the basics. I miss you. I miss the way you make me laugh, the way you always know how to make me feel better when I'm down, and the way you always challenge me to be my best self.But I also hate you. I hate the way you could be so cruel, the way you would try to control me, and the way you never seemed to understand me.I know that we were together for a long time, and that we shared so many amazing memories. But I can't help but feel that it was all a lie. That you were never really the person I thought you were.I remember the first time we met, like it was yesterday. You were so charming, so confident, and so different from anyone I had ever met before. I was drawn to you like a moth to a flame.But over time, things changed. You started to show your true colors, and I realized that I had fallen for a person who didn't really exist.I tried to ignore it, to convince myself that it didn't matter. But it did matter. It mattered a lot.I know that I'm not perfect either. I've made mistakes, and I've hurt you just as much as you've hurt me. But the difference is, I'm willing to admit my mistakes and try to make amends. You never were.I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that it's not you. It's time for us to move on, and find happiness with other people.I hope that one day we can be friends, or at least civil. But for now, I need to let you go.Goodbye, [Ex].",

He was just a low-ranking soldier, not some brilliant strategist.As he huddled behind a pile of rubble, trying to avoid getting killed, an idea began to form in his mind. It was a crazy plan, but it just might work.He remembered a story his grandfather had told him about the Civil War, when a group of Union soldiers had disguised themselves as Confederate soldiers and infiltrated enemy lines. Why not try the same thing?Johnson quickly gathered a small group of volunteers and explained his plan. They would don German uniforms and pretend to be enemy soldiers, hoping to sneak past the enemy's defenses and cause chaos from within.The soldiers looked at him like he was nuts, but they were desperate, and willing to try anything. They quickly scavenged up some German uniforms and set off towards the enemy lines.As they approached, Johnson's heart was pounding. This was a ridiculous plan, and it was likely they would all get killed. But they had to try.They walked confidently towards the enemy positions, trying to look like they belonged. Johnson even shouted out a few commands in German, hoping to convince the enemy they were the real deal.To their surprise, it worked. The Germans barely gave them a second glance as they marched past, straight into the heart of enemy territory.Once inside, they quickly set to work, sabotaging equipment and spreading confusion wherever they went.",

They emerged from their ship, their large, black eyes scanning the surroundings, and their long, slender arms waving awkwardly in greeting.The security team stationed at the White House immediately sprang into action, surrounding the aliens with weapons drawn. \"What do you want?\" one of them demanded, their voice firm but shaking slightly.The lead alien, who had introduced themselves as Zorvath, hesitated for a moment before responding. \"We come in peace,\" they said in a strange, high-pitched voice. \"We have been watching your species for some time and wish to establish contact.\"The security team leader snorted in disbelief. \"You expect us to believe that? You're aliens, for crying out loud! What could you possibly want with us?\"Zorvath sighed, their long, slender mouth twisting into a frown. \"We have come to offer our assistance. We have technology that could greatly benefit your species. But we must establish a line of communication first.\"The White House, however, was not impressed. They saw the aliens as a threat, an invasion force sent to subjugate humanity. They refused to listen to Zorvath's pleas for peaceful communication, instead ordering their military to prepare for an attack.As the tension between the two sides grew, Zorvath realized that they had made a grave mistake. They had not expected such hostility from the humans, and now they were at risk of being attacked.In a last-ditch effort, Zorvath decided to use their advanced technology to attempt to communicate with the humans. They activated a device that would allow them to project their thoughts directly into the minds of the White House officials.The officials were shocked as they suddenly heard Zorvath's voice in their minds. \"We mean you no harm,\" Zorvath said, their voice urgent and sincere. \"Please, do not attack.",

He looked around the room, hoping to find inspiration in the faces of his loved ones, but they all seemed to be waiting for him to say something remarkable.

In a moment of desperation, he blurted out a quote he had always loved, hoping it would sound wise and insightful, but it felt flat and unconvincing even to his own ears.

From wars over resources to senseless acts of violence, humans have consistently shown a willingness to cause harm without any logical reason.Despite their advanced technology and lofty aspirations, humans have never been able to shake this destructive tendency.In fact, it seems that the more advanced human society becomes, the more creative they get in finding new ways to hurt each other.From the brutal dictatorships of the 20th century to the modern-day cyber attacks and drone strikes, humans have perfected the art of destruction.Even in the face of imminent environmental disaster, humans continue to prioritize their own selfish interests over the well-being of their fellow humans and the planet.It's a sad fact that humans are the only known life form in the universe that deliberately causes harm to their own kind, with no apparent benefit or motivation.This disturbing trend has been observed in all corners of the world, from the richest nations to the poorest.Despite the countless attempts at peace and diplomacy, humans consistently fail to learn from their mistakes and continue down the path of destruction.As the human population grows and competition for resources intensifies, it's hard to imagine this trend reversing anytime soon.In fact, it's a miracle that humanity has made it this far without completely obliterating themselves.But perhaps that's the key to their survival - the ability to adapt and evolve in the face of adversity, even if it means harming others in the process.It's a harsh reality, but one that humans must face head-on if they hope to find a way out of this cycle of violence and destruction.The question remains, however, whether humans will ever learn to coexist peacefully, or if their inherent flaws will ultimately lead to their downfall.",

I would be defeated by a hero, or killed by a group of rebels.I felt a cold sweat on my brow. Was this my fate? Was I destined to be a villain, doomed to meet a tragic end?I couldn't take it anymore.

Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends. the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called. I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt. The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more. when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total. Stay away from their service department",

Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.

I have never had a wait staff say \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest. (I used this time to read other Yelp reviews for my meal selection. ) I can only hope that service is like this at all times. For my money it doesn't get any better here. nnFood: CnUnfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. I got the chicken parmesan after reading that the salads were less than overwhelming. I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty). nnQuite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings. I can forgive bad service if the food is great (the tip is an interesting invention) but not the other way around. My search for a go-to Italian restaurant will continue, though I can't say I won't be back if I get another invitation.",

Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it. It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better. Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye. The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy. My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza. Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show. nnThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

They tinker needlessly with the menu. Their food has gotten tasteless. And for a time, you had to go ask for the breadsticks instead of having them brought to you. nnI used to love their food. Now, it's just okay. Mediocre, really. I no longer look forward to going to Fazoli's. What once used to be a weekly thing when I was younger has become a once, maybe twice yearly thing. And each time I go back, I remember what used to be and swear that I'll never return. nnBut those breadsticks--they're like crack, man.",

Amazingly, she told us they were well behind every Friday night which spells out the incompetence of the chef/owner in not hiring more staff. That evening our meal at a family restaurant took 2 hours. If you dine there Mon-Thurs it's a pretty decent, if unspectacular, experience but weekends are atrocious and apparently the owner is indifferent towards improving it. nThe Fort Mill and Tega Cay areas are clearly expanding and thus existing businesses should flourish but without a competent owner to relieve the chef/owner Demarco's is going to fall behind. This would have been 4-5 stars 2 years ago but lack of staff makes dining here take the same time as it would a top-notch Charlotte restaurant and borderline unbearable for families or anyone who wants to enjoy the balance of their weekend. nGet the take-out and bring it home, you'll save money via savings on high-markup alcohol and have a far better experience!! !",

The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited. The food leaves a lot to be desired. We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong. The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor. The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting. The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre. The fries were mushy and limp. On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated. The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place. Hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in, but I think the building is beyond saving at this point.",

The menu is seafood heavy and we wound up ordering calamari and mussels to share. The tomato sauce for the mussels was some of the best that I have had in a long time. The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari. nnFor entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \"Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette. I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here. They were busy on the weeknight that we stopped by so there were a lot of servers running around. nnSo I guess that my relationship with Upstream is back on again, but I think that we can both agree that it's ok for us to see other people as well.",

This place has been around forever and it's seems to have progressed with the times. The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic, and remarkably they still have some of the old school ones still around, Goldrush and Thunder road. Love roller coaster, but I must admit that the \"Afterburner\" made me a little nauseous after about the 6th ride. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full torque, so thank God for the water park, it was a chance to cool off. NOTE:  Sunblock is a must. nnThere is a family, young persons/toddler section, that's fantastic, and now that I again have toddlers I can assure you that I'll end up spending a fair amount of time in it. nnAll in all and great time for all.

The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds. The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others. I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am. I got precious few hours sleep that night!.

I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room. nnWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property. nnIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property. I requested a cab pick-up for 5: 50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting. As you may have guessed, this did not happen. Despite their best effort, no cab was there.

Service was good and fast, food was very nice and tasted as decent as any other of these types of restaurants. nnThe only thing worth mentioning, and it's not really a good thing, is that with your chips and salsa they also give you a little dish of a white dip. I couldn't place it exactly but it kinda tasted like ranch and bacon. It was very artificial tasting too.. . maybe from a powder and cream cheese? Who knows? It wasn't horrible, but it just did't mesh well with the other stuff. nnAlso, for what it is, generic Mexican-themed food, it's kinda pricey. You really won't find a decent dish for under $8 on the menu after 3pm. Just thought I'd throw it out there. nnAll in all, going here is like going to McDonald's for a burger.

Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross. The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either. The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias.

We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night. nnThat was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food. nnGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. nnOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it. nnDefinitely will not return.",

I am the sort who sits down and says, \"I don't care what you do, just give me a great haircut. \" Before cutting, Richard administers a sort-of consultation during which you have the chance to express your preferences until he gets a wild look in his eyes, indicating he has decided what he is going to do and seductively explains it in such a way that you can't refuse. He has a wildly ambitious passion that will make you wonder about taking him to bed, though no doubt about it, it's going to be all about him. nnThe first cut was probably the best I've ever had. It was the sort of style that warranted countless compliments from friends and strangers alike. nnMy most recent cut included a lap dance to the entirety of Estefan's \"Turn the Beat Around. \" Inviting eye contact, check. Suggestive pelvic motions, oh yes. Risky jump onto rotating chair, tip increase. Flips of the hair (mine), obviously. Clipping all the while! What more could I have asked for other than for him to \"take it all off!? \" Luckily, I maintained composure and did walk out with a decent mid-length haircut. nnSo, between the two experiences, I do feel that I got great bangs for my bucks. Bangs on my head, expert blow jobs and a comic fantasy for a fuck. nnMy only real issue with this salon is the atmosphere. It has about as much character as Super Cuts and operates like a busy factory, each master stylist having his own minions to order about.

Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase.

Sometimes it can get pretty loud. nnHowever, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine. nnI've tried three entrees: nn1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pastann2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for menn3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had.

There was also a perfect dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not loved it. This stuff, I loved. It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. nnThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going.

Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers. Thats fine. But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game. SERIOUSLY. I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. nnThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.

Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.",

I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure.

We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.

For the next 20 minutes, no employee acknowledged our existence, although we quickly placed our closed menus at the edge of the table to signal our readiness to order. As the minutes ticked away, I tried not to look at the foul carpeting, which appears to have been last cleaned approximately never. A cook emerged from the kitchen and quite literally shouted over our heads to a waitress at the far end of the nearly-filled dining room because he couldn't read her writing. (Have these people never eaten in a restaurant themselves?? ) Even still, we waited.. . until I absently flicked at one of the dozens of dark spots on the wall above our booth. It flew away. INSECTS ALL OVER THE WALL. If that's how the front is maintained, what must the kitchen look like?? ? We reopened the menu, found beverage prices and left money on the table. There was no indication that any of the waitresses or the hostess even noticed. DISGUSTING AND INEXCUSABLE. The place needs to be shut down and fumigated. Are they afraid they'd lose money if they closed long enough to CLEAN? Do they pay anyone to clean anything? I'll never go back.",

As for the service, it left much to be desired. Our server seemed disinterested and inattentive, taking forever to bring us our drinks and forgetting some of our orders entirely. Moreover, the food was subpar at best. I ordered a burger, hoping for a juicy and flavorful experience, but what arrived was a dry and overcooked patty that lacked any notable seasoning. The fries were nothing to write home about either, just your average, forgettable side dish. And the prices were not justified by the quality of the food or overall experience. It felt like I was paying a premium for a below-average meal. In terms of ambiance, Bar Louie failed to impress as well. The lighting was too dim for my liking, making it difficult to even see the menu properly. The music was overly loud, drowning out any attempt at conversation. Overall, I left Bar Louie feeling unsatisfied and unimpressed. There are plenty of other dining options in town that offer better food, service, and atmosphere. I won't be returning anytime soon, if ever.",

However, the service left much to be desired. It took ages for someone to acknowledge our presence, and even longer to bring us menus. Once we finally placed our orders, the wait for food seemed interminable. When the dishes did arrive, they were disappointingly lackluster. I opted for the avocado toast, which looked promising on the menu but fell flat on my plate. The bread was overly toasted and almost burnt, making it difficult to bite into. The avocado was not ripe enough and lacked the smooth, creamy texture I was hoping for. It felt like a haphazardly assembled dish rather than a carefully prepared one. My partner ordered the vegan scramble, which consisted of tofu and vegetables. While the flavors were decent, the portion size was underwhelming, leaving us both feeling unsatisfied. To make matters worse, the coffee was lukewarm and tasted stale. It seemed like it had been sitting in the pot for far too long. We tried to request a fresh pot, but the server was nowhere to be found. The lack of attentiveness from the staff was a recurring theme throughout the entire meal. As we glanced around the restaurant, it was evident that others were experiencing similar frustrations. Tables around us were growing impatient and the murmurs of discontent filled the air. It was clear that the establishment was understaffed and struggling to keep up with the demand. On top of everything, the prices were exorbitant considering the overall subpar experience. We expected a certain level of quality and service for the amount we were paying, but unfortunately, it was nowhere to be found. In the end, we left the Quiet Storm with empty stomachs and a sense of disappointment. It's a shame because we had heard positive things about this place, but our multiple visits have consistently left us unimpressed.",

The staff appeared disinterested and unenthusiastic, barely acknowledging my presence. It took what felt like an eternity just to get a menu and place my order. When my food finally arrived, it was a further letdown. I had heard rave reviews about their signature omelets, so I decided to give one a try. Unfortunately, the omelet lacked flavor and was disappointingly bland. The ingredients seemed haphazardly thrown together, with no thought given to taste or seasoning. Even the side of toast was lackluster, resembling something I could have made at home with minimal effort. The coffee, touted as their house blend, was weak and unremarkable, failing to provide that much-needed morning pick-me-up. Despite the underwhelming food and lackluster service, I decided to give the Rusty Nail another chance by ordering a stack of their famous pancakes. Regrettably, they were just as uninspiring as the rest of the meal. The pancakes were dense and dry, lacking the fluffy texture and delicious flavor I had hoped for. It seems the Rusty Nail's reputation as a breakfast haven was sorely misplaced. With so many other enticing breakfast options in town, I won't be returning to this lackluster establishment anytime soon.",

The routes are creative and thoughtfully set, incorporating interesting features and movement sequences. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the different problems and challenging myself to improve my technique. The crash pads are ample and in good condition, providing a safe landing for falls. The atmosphere in the bouldering section is generally positive, with climbers encouraging each other and offering helpful beta. However, I did notice that the cleanliness of the mats could be improved, as there were some chalk and dirt buildup in certain areas. One downside is the limited seating available near the bouldering area, which can be inconvenient during busy times when you need a break or want to observe others climbing. Additionally, the overall facility could benefit from better ventilation as it tends to get quite hot and stuffy. Despite these minor drawbacks, if you're primarily interested in bouldering and looking for a solid indoor climbing experience in Pittsburgh, this place is definitely worth checking out.",

The service was slow and inattentive, with waitstaff seemingly disinterested in providing a pleasant dining experience.As for the food, it was a complete disaster. I started with the so-called \"house specialty\" soup, and it tasted like a bland, watered-down broth with no discernible flavor. It was served lukewarm, further adding to the disappointment. Hoping that the main course would redeem the meal, I ordered the chicken Parmesan. To my dismay, the chicken was dry and overcooked, lacking any juiciness or tenderness. The sauce on top looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours, forming a congealed layer that was far from appetizing.My companion fared no better with their choice of pasta. They ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, expecting a creamy and flavorful dish. However, what arrived at the table was a clumpy mess of pasta drowning in a watery sauce. There was barely a trace of the promised Parmesan cheese, and the overall taste was bland and uninspired.We also decided to try a couple of desserts in a feeble attempt to salvage the evening. The tiramisu arrived looking sad and deflated, with dry ladyfingers and a barely-there layer of mascarpone. It lacked the rich coffee flavor and luscious creaminess that make tiramisu a beloved classic. The cannoli, touted as a house specialty, was equally disappointing. The filling was grainy and overly sweet, and the pastry shell tasted stale, as if it had been sitting out for days.Throughout the meal, we couldn't help but notice the constant buzz of discontent among other diners. Tables around us were complaining about undercooked pasta, flavorless sauces, and subpar service.",

Nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance and ordered their famous Bibimbap. When the dish arrived, I was shocked by what I saw. The presentation was sloppy, with the ingredients haphazardly thrown together in a bowl. The rice was overcooked and mushy, and the vegetables seemed like they had been sitting out for far too long. The meat was dry and lacked any kind of flavor. It was a sad excuse for Bibimbap, and I couldn't help but feel disappointed.The service was also a letdown. The waitstaff seemed disinterested and inattentive. I had to ask multiple times for a glass of water, and my request for extra napkins was completely ignored. It felt like they just didn't care about the customers or their dining experience.As if things couldn't get worse, the prices were completely unjustified for the quality of the food. I expected a higher price tag for a renowned restaurant, but this was just absurd. I felt like I was being ripped off for a subpar meal, and it left a bitter taste in my mouth.I should note that the only redeeming factor was the side dishes. The kimchi and pickled vegetables were the only things that tasted somewhat decent. But let's be honest, you can't build a reputation on side dishes alone.Overall, my experience at Kim's restaurant was a complete letdown. The food was below average, the service was lacking, and the prices were exorbitant. I had high expectations, and they were shattered. I won't be returning to this place, and I can't recommend it to anyone seeking an authentic Korean dining experience. Save your money and find another restaurant that truly deserves your two stars.",

The inefficiency of the Port Authority bus system not only wastes commuters' time but also affects their productivity and daily schedules. Considering the importance of a reliable public transportation system in a city, I sincerely hope that improvements can be made to enhance the efficiency and quality of the Port Authority bus system in Pittsburgh.",

        "text": "There's always a consistent flow of customers looking to work on their golf game without having to travel far. However, this particular driving range seems to be lacking in certain areas. The range balls, for instance, are in desperate need of an upgrade. They're worn out and don't provide the true feel of a good shot. It becomes frustrating when you're trying to gauge your distance and accuracy, but the equipment hinders your progress. Additionally, the mats themselves are in a sorry state. They're old, worn, and uneven, making it difficult to get into a proper hitting rhythm. It's disappointing to see such neglect in a facility that could be so profitable. The practice putting green is another sore point. Every putt you attempt becomes an unpredictable adventure due to the excessive break on the green. It's virtually impossible to practice your level putts and gain any consistency. Moreover, the condition of the grass on the putting green is subpar at best. The uneven surface and patches of unhealthy grass make it difficult to get a true roll and feels like a missed opportunity to improve your short game. As for the practice chipping green, it poses its own set of challenges. The incline is far too steep, causing well-struck shots to roll off the edge and down the hill, often reaching the fence by the driving range. It's frustrating to have your practice shots punished rather than rewarded. While the location of the driving range is convenient for tourists and beginners, serious golfers seeking a place to sharpen their skills will be left disappointed. It lacks the necessary facilities and attention to detail required for rigorous practice. It's a shame because with the right investments and improvements, this driving range has the potential to cater to a wider range of golfers and capture a larger clientele.",

I decided to give Vincent's a try and placed an order online. The delivery arrived within a reasonable time, and I was pleased with the packaging and presentation of the food. I ordered the classic margherita pizza and a side of garlic knots. The pizza had a thin, crispy crust, and the combination of fresh tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella was simply delicious. The flavors balanced perfectly, and each bite was a delight. The garlic knots were warm, soft, and generously coated in garlic butter. They were the perfect accompaniment to the pizza.

I had hoped for a warm and welcoming greeting, but instead, I was met with a dismissive attitude. Ignoring her less-than-inviting presence, I requested a table for two and was led to a corner booth that seemed to be hidden away from the rest of the restaurant. It felt isolated and lacked the lively atmosphere I had hoped for. Once seated, it took an incredibly long time for a server to acknowledge our presence. We sat there, growing increasingly frustrated, as we watched other tables around us receive prompt service. Finally, a server made their way over, but their lackadaisical attitude mirrored that of the hostess. They barely made eye contact and seemed disinterested in taking our drink orders. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, we managed to place our drink order and awaited their arrival.To our disappointment, the drinks arrived haphazardly and were clearly made without care. The cocktail I had ordered was diluted and lacked the flavor it should have had. It was evident that attention to detail was not a priority for the bartender. Nonetheless, we decided to proceed with ordering our meals, hoping that the food would compensate for the lackluster drinks.Regrettably, the food didn't fare much better. The presentation was lackluster, and the dishes appeared hastily thrown together. My steak, which I had ordered medium-rare, arrived overcooked and dry. The sides lacked seasoning and were barely warm. It was evident that the kitchen staff were not invested in delivering a quality dining experience.Throughout the meal, the service continued to disappoint.

Maybe I've been to too many water parks, but these rides just didn't live up to my expectations.On the positive side, they had a decent lazy river. It was nice to kick back and relax while floating along the gentle current. The wave pool was also fun, although it got way too crowded later in the day.

Oh boy, don't even get me started. I understand that Home Depot is a reputable brand, and quality comes at a cost. However, it often feels like they take advantage of their market dominance by inflating prices. I found myself consistently questioning whether the premium I was paying was truly justified or if I could find the same items for a better deal elsewhere.Perhaps my biggest gripe, though, is the lack of attention to detail. Sure, the shelves are stocked, and everything is neatly organized, but there's an element of soullessness.

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with a strange smell that lingered throughout the entire place, making it difficult to fully enjoy the meal. The ambiance, or lack thereof, definitely left much to be desired. The lighting was too bright, giving off a sterile and impersonal vibe that didn't create a pleasant dining atmosphere.Moving on to the service, it was painfully slow and inattentive. It took an eternity for the waitstaff to acknowledge our presence, let alone take our orders. We had to flag someone down just to get some water, and even then, they seemed annoyed by our request. Once we finally placed our orders, the wait for the food seemed never-ending. It felt like we were being forgotten in the chaos of the restaurant.When the food finally arrived, it was a sad sight. The presentation was lackluster, and the dishes themselves looked unappetizing. I took a bite of the supposed \"signature\" dish, and I have to say, it was flavorless and bland. The ingredients seemed low quality, and it was clear that no thought or effort had been put into the preparation. I couldn't help but wonder if they were cutting corners in the kitchen.To make matters worse, the portion sizes were ridiculously small for the prices they were charging. I felt like I had ordered from a fancy restaurant and received an appetizer-sized meal. It was a clear case of overpricing, and I left the place feeling not only unsatisfied but also ripped off. The value for money was simply nonexistent.The saddest part was that even the dessert, usually a saving grace, couldn't redeem the meal. We ordered their \"chef's special\" dessert, and it was a complete letdown. The presentation was sloppy, and the taste was underwhelming. It lacked the creativity and finesse that you would expect from a restaurant of this alleged caliber.",

The restaurant itself had a classy yet comfortable atmosphere, with dark wood accents and soft lighting throughout. I was excited to try their renowned seafood dishes, as I had heard great things about them. However, as the evening unfolded, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The service started off on the wrong foot. It took ages for someone to come and take our order, and even then, the server seemed rushed and inattentive. We had to constantly call for their attention, which was frustrating. It's a shame because good service can really elevate the dining experience.When our food finally arrived, I couldn't help but notice the lackluster presentation. The dishes looked hastily put together, and the garnishes were practically non-existent. Presentation might not be everything, but it does contribute to the overall appeal of the meal.Now, let's talk about the flavors. I ordered the shrimp scampi, hoping for a rich and garlicky dish bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, what I got was a rather bland and uninspiring rendition. The shrimp lacked seasoning, and the accompanying pasta was overcooked and mushy. It was quite a letdown considering the price I paid.My companion ordered the seafood platter, which came with a variety of fish, shrimp, and scallops. While the seafood itself was fresh, the flavors were underwhelming. Some of the items were overcooked, resulting in a dry and chewy texture. It felt like the kitchen missed the mark on executing the dishes properly.In terms of portion sizes, they were definitely on the smaller side. I understand that quality is important, but when you're paying a premium price, you expect a satisfying amount of food on your plate. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here.One thing that really bothered me was the pricing. I found the menu to be absurdly priced, considering the underwhelming experience I had.",

The place looked impressive from the outside, with its towering walls and colorful handholds. As we entered, we were greeted by a friendly staff member who seemed genuinely interested in helping us. However, our enthusiasm quickly turned into disappointment once we started our climbing session. The lack of proper equipment was evident as there were not enough mats to cushion our falls. Safety should always be a priority, and this was a major oversight on their part. Moreover, the gym's cleanliness left much to be desired. The floors were sticky, and the holds had a slippery residue on them, making it difficult to get a good grip. We expressed our concerns to the staff, hoping for a quick resolution, but they seemed indifferent to our feedback. It was frustrating to see their lack of concern for the climbers' well-being. To make matters worse, the pricing was exorbitant for the quality of service and facilities they offered. We felt ripped off and taken advantage of. Overall, our experience at this indoor climbing gym was extremely disappointing. It's a shame because we were hoping for an enjoyable time with our friends, but instead, we left feeling frustrated and let down.

I remember the countless times I wandered through those aisles, searching for hidden treasures and stumbling upon unexpected bargains. Kmart holds a special place in my heart, a relic of days gone by when department stores were the epicenter of shopping adventures.Well, I have to admit, Kmart has seen better days. The fluorescent lights overhead are dimmer now, casting a slightly melancholic atmosphere upon the once vibrant store. There's a nostalgic charm to the worn-out carpets and the creaking shopping carts, though it's a bittersweet reminder of the changing retail landscape.It's no secret that Kmart faces fierce competition from online retailers and sleek, modern stores. Yet, despite its faded glory, there's still something undeniably endearing about the place. The friendly staff, clad in their retro blue vests, greet you with a warm smile and an air of resilience.While the shelves may not be as fully stocked as they once were, Kmart still manages to surprise. Every now and then, you stumble upon a gem amidst the clearance racks—a forgotten board game or a childhood favorite toy. It's like unearthing buried treasure, a moment of pure delight.Sure, the layout might be a bit haphazard and the aisles could use some tidying up, but Kmart has an authenticity that modern chain stores often lack. It's a reminder of simpler times, where shopping was an adventure and not just a task to be checked off the to-do list.Then there's the unmistakable scent that wafts through the air—a unique mixture of new merchandise, cleaning products, and a hint of nostalgia. It's a smell you can't quite describe but instantly recognize as the quintessential department store aroma.Despite all its quirks and imperfections, Kmart remains an integral part of the community. It's a meeting point for neighbors, a hub of activity where kids beg their parents for a toy or a visit to the cafe.",

The charming ambiance, the authentic decor, and the heavenly aroma of sausages sizzling on the grill instantly transport me back to the delightful Bavarian streets. However, it's worth mentioning that the restaurant's location can sometimes be a double-edged sword. Being right near the hospital means the surroundings can get a bit busy and chaotic, especially during peak hours. The constant sound of ambulance sirens whizzing by and the occasional hustle and bustle of health professionals rushing in and out of the hospital can be a little distracting. But let's not dwell on the negatives because the food here more than makes up for any minor inconveniences. Every dish I've tried has been an absolute treat for my taste buds. From their mouthwatering schnitzels to their delectable pretzels, the chefs at this place clearly know how to capture the essence of German cuisine. The portions are generous, ensuring you leave with a happy and satisfied tummy.The staff here are also incredibly friendly and attentive. They always greet me with a warm smile and go out of their way to ensure my dining experience is enjoyable. One time, I had a special request for a vegetarian version of a traditional German dish, and they gladly accommodated it without compromising on taste or quality. It's this level of personalized service that sets this restaurant apart.In addition to the delightful food and outstanding service, the prices here are surprisingly reasonable. Considering the quality and authenticity of the cuisine, you'd expect to pay a premium, but this place manages to strike the perfect balance between value and taste. It's refreshing to find a restaurant that offers such a memorable dining experience without breaking the bank.Overall, despite its proximity to the hospital, this German restaurant has become my go-to place whenever I crave a taste of Germany.",

The warm, rustic decor added to the ambience, with exposed brick walls adorned with old black-and-white photographs of Italian landmarks.The menu was a delight for any Italian food lover. From classic pasta dishes to mouthwatering antipasti platters, they had it all. I decided to start with the bruschetta, and oh boy, it was a flavor explosion in my mouth.

Their passion for authentic Italian cuisine was evident in the way they spoke about the ingredients and the cooking techniques.As I savored every bite, I couldn't help but appreciate the attention to detail that went into each dish. The pasta was cooked al dente, just like it should be, and the sauces were perfectly balanced, allowing the flavors to shine. It was evident that the chefs in the kitchen knew what they were doing and had a deep understanding of Italian culinary traditions.To end the meal on a sweet note, I indulged in a classic tiramisu.",

So, I give it a shot, order my usual black coffee with a shot of espresso, hoping that at least the coffee will be decent. Well, I couldn't be more disappointed. The coffee tastes like it's been sitting there for hours, burnt and bitter, leaving a nasty aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for hours. It's like they don't know how to make a proper cup of joe.Oh, and don't even think about finding a place to sit. The few available seats are usually occupied by people glued to their laptops, hogging the space for hours on end. It's as if this place has become a free coworking space instead of a café. How am I supposed to enjoy my coffee when I'm standing like a lost soul, desperately trying to find a spot?To top it all off, the prices are way too high for the subpar experience you get. I'm not one to count every penny, but c'mon, it's like they're robbing you blind. For that kind of money, I expect exceptional coffee and service, not this disappointing circus.In conclusion, this location may have its convenient proximity to my workplace, but the overall experience is far from satisfactory.",

The sea bass was perfectly grilled, retaining its moistness, and the tanginess of the lemon caper sauce complemented the delicate flavor of the fish.The service throughout the evening was attentive and friendly.

I opted for their signature dish, the \"Sizzling Beef Platter.\" The menu described it as tender beef strips, sautéed with colorful veggies in a savory sauce.

As I sat down, it took ages for a server to acknowledge my presence, and even then, they seemed more interested in chatting with coworkers than taking my order. Frustrated, I finally managed to place my drink order, only to wait another eternity for it to arrive. When it finally did, it was clear that they had completely forgotten about it. To make matters worse, when I tried to flag down the server to rectify the situation, they brushed me off with a pretty disrespectful attitude. At this point, my appetite was all but ruined, but I reluctantly ordered my meal, hoping it would salvage the experience. However, the food was a letdown as well, lacking flavor and appearing rushed in its presentation. Needless to say, it was not a pleasant dining experience. I have no intention of returning to this establishment, as there are plenty of other wonderful restaurants that value their customers and prioritize service.",

The moment I laid eyes on this cozy little basement restaurant, the aroma of freshly baked bread and sizzling bacon wafting through the air, I knew I had to succumb to its irresistible charm. I was starving for some sustenance after a long morning exploring the vibrant streets of the Strip, and this place seemed like the perfect spot to recharge.As I stepped inside, the warm and welcoming atmosphere enveloped me, instantly making me feel at home. The wooden tables were adorned with flowers, and soft jazz music played in the background. The friendly staff greeted me with genuine smiles, ready to guide me through their mouthwatering menu. Good thing I did my research beforehand because the choices were plentiful and all equally enticing.After much deliberation, I settled on their signature dish, a nice and fluffy crepe filled with savory ham, melted cheese, and fresh spinach. The first bite transported me to a world of flavors. The crepe was perfectly cooked, golden and slightly crispy on the edges, while the creamy cheese melted into the tender folds of the ham. The combination of the savory fillings with the delicate crepe was simply divine.To balance out the savory delight, I couldn't resist indulging in one of their decadent dessert crepes. The menu boasted a sweet creation that featured a generous spread of Nutella, topped with delicate swirls of whipped cream and a sprinkle of toasted almonds. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I know, I'm a weirdo!Besides the heavenly food, what impressed me the most at this hidden gem was the attention to detail. The presentation of each dish was a work of art, a feast for both the eyes and the taste buds. The ingredients were fresh, and the love and passion of the chefs shone through in every bite.",

The ambiance seemed promising at first, with dim lighting and soft music playing in the background. However, as soon as my partner and I were seated, we were ignored for what felt like an eternity. Our server, who seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than attending to our needs, finally sauntered over to take our drink order. We placed our requests and patiently waited for what seemed like an eternity. And waited. And waited some more. When the drinks finally arrived, they were lukewarm and tasted like they had been sitting out for hours. Not the refreshing start we had hoped for. Frustrated, we flagged down our server to inquire about our appetizer order. To our astonishment, she informed us that they had run out of the dish we had specifically come for. Already disappointed, we decided to give the main course a chance. But alas, it was yet another letdown. The food arrived at our table cold and poorly presented. The steak, which should have been cooked to perfection, was tough and overcooked. The side dishes lacked flavor and were barely warm. We summoned the server once again, hoping for some resolution to our string of misfortunes. However, her response left us dumbfounded. She offered a half-hearted apology and blamed the kitchen staff for the mishaps, but showed no intention of rectifying the situation. Feeling frustrated and hungry, we decided to cut our losses and ask for the check. But even that simple request seemed to be a challenge for our server. She vanished into thin air, leaving us sitting at the table for what felt like an eternity. Finally, after what can only be described as an excruciating wait, the bill arrived. But our ordeal wasn't over yet.",

As soon as I stepped foot onto the property, I was captivated by the picturesque surroundings. The lush green gardens, the vibrant flowers in full bloom, and the tranquil sounds of nature created a serene atmosphere that instantly put me at ease. The home itself was equally impressive. The architecture exuded elegance and charm, with its tasteful combination of modern elements and classic design. Every room was meticulously decorated, and the attention to detail was evident in every corner. The cozy living room with its fireplace became the perfect spot to curl up with a good book on the rainy evenings. The well-equipped kitchen made preparing meals a breeze, and the spacious dining area was ideal for hosting memorable dinner parties with friends and family. The bedrooms were like havens of comfort, boasting plush beds and soft linens that ensured a restful night's sleep. Waking up to the gentle rays of sunlight streaming through the windows was such a delight. Exploring the grounds was an adventure in itself. Wandering along the winding pathways, I discovered hidden nooks and crannies, each offering a different perspective of the breathtaking scenery. The meticulously manicured lawns were perfect for picnics and outdoor games, while the tranquil pond was an oasis of peace. As I reluctantly packed up my belongings to leave, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the unforgettable memories created in this idyllic home. It was a slice of paradise that exceeded all my expectations. Without a doubt, I highly recommend experiencing the magic of this place for yourself.",

Let me tell you, it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. First of all, getting in touch with their customer service was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I called multiple times and was put on hold for what felt like an eternity, only to be greeted by a disinterested representative who seemed more interested in the latest gossip than resolving my issue.When I finally managed to schedule a rental, the troubles didn't stop there. The tuxedo they provided me with was a complete disaster. It was wrinkled beyond belief, as if it had been crumpled up in a ball and then hastily thrown at me. And don't get me started on the fit! It was as if they gave me a tuxedo two sizes too small, making me look like a sausage stuffed into a casing.But that's not even the worst part. On the day of the event, I realized they had forgotten to include the bow tie and cummerbund. I mean, seriously? How could they forget such basic accessories? I had to run around town at the last minute to find replacements, and let me tell you, it was not a fun experience.To top it all off, when I tried to voice my concerns and request a refund, they were completely unresponsive. It was as if my complaints fell on deaf ears. I reached out via email, social media, and even through their website's contact form, but received no acknowledgment or resolution.Honestly, I wouldn't wish this tuxedo rental service on my worst enemy. The lack of professionalism, the poor quality of the tuxedo, and the complete disregard for customer satisfaction are simply unacceptable. Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere for your special event attire. Trust me, you'll thank me later.",

I had heard so many positive things about this place and had been looking forward to trying it out for myself. My friends and I were excited to gather around the teppanyaki grill, enjoy some delicious Japanese cuisine, and witness the impressive culinary skills of the chefs. However, our expectations were shattered right from the moment we walked in.First of all, the atmosphere was off. The restaurant was overcrowded and noisy, making it hard to have a decent conversation without raising our voices. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and didn't greet us with a warm welcome. We were rushed to our table without any explanation of the dining experience. It felt like we were just another group of customers to them.To make matters worse, the service was incredibly slow. We waited for what felt like an eternity before a server even acknowledged our presence. When we finally managed to place our drink orders, it took forever for the drinks to arrive. Our glasses sat empty while we observed other tables being served. It was frustrating and disappointing to see such a lack of attention to customers.When the food finally arrived, it was nothing extraordinary. The sushi rolls lacked freshness, and the sashimi tasted bland. It was evident that the quality of the ingredients was subpar. We observed the chefs at the teppanyaki grills, and even their performance seemed lackluster. The usual excitement and showmanship were absent.To add insult to injury, our orders were mixed up. One of my friends received the wrong dish, and when we alerted the server, they simply shrugged it off and said they would bring the correct one. By the time the correct dish arrived, the rest of us had almost finished our meals. It was an incredibly frustrating experience that left us feeling neglected and irritated.But the final straw was the bill.",

        "text": "We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. Let me start by saying that we had high expectations for this iconic Pittsburgh institution. The place was bustling with locals and tourists, creating a lively atmosphere that added to our anticipation. As we perused the menu, we couldn't help but notice the sheer size of the sandwiches. They were unlike anything we had seen before, towering with mountains of coleslaw and fries stuffed between thick slices of Italian bread. Impressed by the reputation, we decided to try their famous \"Pitts-Burger\" and a classic pastrami sandwich. The service was friendly and attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive.However, as we took the first bite of the Pitts-Burger, we were slightly disappointed. While the meat was well-cooked and flavorful, the excessive amount of slaw and fries overwhelmed the overall taste. The coleslaw had a tangy flavor, but it dominated the sandwich, leaving little room for the other ingredients to shine. The fries, although crispy, became soggy due to the combination of condiments. It felt more like eating a coleslaw and fry sandwich with a hint of burger rather than a well-balanced burger.Moving on to the pastrami sandwich, we hoped it would redeem our dining experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations as well. The pastrami lacked the tenderness and bold flavors we've come to love in a classic deli sandwich. The bread, although fresh, couldn't make up for the underwhelming fillings. We were left craving more complexity and depth in the tastes.On the positive side, the restaurant's ambiance and history added charm to our visit. The walls were adorned with sports memorabilia and photographs, showcasing the local pride and strong community spirit. We appreciated the genuine Pittsburgh vibe that surrounded us.In conclusion, while Primanti Bros has a rich history and a unique concept, our experience fell short of the hype.",

There are several within a short drive of this theater, and they offer a much better experience.nnHere are a few of my recommendations:nn* AMC Southpoint 16: This theater has comfortable reclining seats, large screens, and a state-of-the-art sound system.* Regal Meridian 16: This theater has luxurious leather seats, spacious auditoriums, and a wide variety of concessions.* Cinépolis Charlotte: This theater offers a unique movie-going experience, with plush seating, gourmet food and drinks, and a full bar.nnAny of these theaters would be a much better choice than the theater that I reviewed.",

It has old school charm and is smaller than most casinos. The casino is laid out so that you can see everything from one end to the other. Ding! Ding! Ding! Hit a jackpot on my first pull! The loosest slots in Vegas according to a local. If you don't win here you won't win anywhere.  For an older casino it has been updated nicely. The rooms are nice and clean with new furniture, flat screen TV's and granite counter tops.  The beds were really comfortable and had great pillows.  The bathroom was small but didn't feel cramped.  The shower was bigger than most hotel showers. The casino is in a great location right downtown on Fremont Street.  It is close to everything.  If you can book a room facing Fremont Street.  I loved watching the light show and people watching.  One night the Fremont Street Experience was having a party with music and dancing.  It was so much fun sitting on the balcony watching everyone having fun below.  We ate at the buffet for breakfast one morning.  It was a typical Vegas buffet.  The food was just average.  I would recommend trying one of the many restaurants nearby.  The Golden Gate has a great little coffee shop that is reasonably priced.  It has a 50's theme.  We had lunch there once and it was good. The servers and staff were very friendly and helpful.  They made us feel right at home.  It is nice to stay in a hotel that isn't huge and impersonal.  It was great hearing all the history of this hotel.  The bellman told us that the hotel was built by a man that made his millions during the gold rush in California.  He spared no expense on this hotel.  The safe in our room was the original safe from when the hotel was built.  There were even bullet holes in it.  I think it is really cool to stay in a place with so much history.",

Upon arriving, we had no idea it was a BYOB, but quickly walked over to the closest gas station to grab some beverages. My husband tried calling ahead to order a pizza but no one picked up. When we arrived the restaurant was empty and the staff was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with only a couple high tops and smaller tables. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer of mozzarella sticks.We tried a few different types of pizza by ordering a few small pies. The margherita pizza was one of my favorites - just the right combination of cheese and sauce! The veggie pizza could have used a bit more flavor, but the crust is amazing. The sausage and pepperoni were very tasty. It wasn’t too greasy, and the ingredients tasted very fresh. We also ordered a side of garlic knots which were very good. They were a little oily, but soft and fluffy on the inside.Overall, it was a great experience. The food was great, but I have to say the customer service was above and beyond. When we first got there they were a little slow on getting our drinks, so they brought us some complimentary garlic knots while we waited. The waiter even brought my 3 year old out a little dough to play with to keep her occupied. We had such a good experience that we ordered some food to go to take home for later.I will definitely be going back to McHales! The prices were reasonable, the food was delicious, and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend it if you’re looking for a good meal!",

It's been incredibly frustrating to deal with their lack of communication and follow-through. For example, I recently submitted a ticket for a technical issue and didn't receive a response for over a week. When I finally did hear back, the response was completely unhelpful and didn't address my issue at all. I've also had to call multiple times to follow up on requests, only to be put on hold for long periods of time or disconnected.It's really disappointing to see such a decline in Muzak's service, especially after being a loyal customer for so many years. I'm considering switching to another provider at this point because I can't afford to keep dealing with these issues.Another example of Muzak's poor service is when I tried to cancel my subscription. I called customer service and was told that I would need to send a written letter of cancellation. I did so, but then I continued to be billed for the service. When I called to inquire about this, I was told that they had never received my letter. I had to send it again, and then it took another two months for my subscription to be cancelled.I'm really disappointed with the way Muzak has handled my account. I've been a loyal customer for many years, but I'm no longer confident that they can provide me with the level of service that I expect. I'm considering switching to another provider.",

I’m not sure if it’s the intelligent conversation or the soothing voices that make me feel this way, but for whatever reason I have always dreamed of being a part of it, even if it’s just a caller. And now my dream might finally come true!I recently discovered NPR’s “You Betcha” podcast. The podcast focuses on the cultural differences between people from Minnesota and people from elsewhere. As a born-and-raised Minnesotan, I have always been fascinated by the way people from other states seem to view the Upper Midwest. On this podcast, comedians and hosts Cari and Sam talk about everything from the accent to the food to the traditions we hold near and dear.Since I’ve been listening to “You Betcha,” I’ve been trying to find ways to work the show into my own life. I’ve been telling my friends about it, leaving reviews on iTunes, and even sending them story ideas. And then it hit me. What if I called in? Why not talk about something that Minnesotans will definitely have a unique take on? The Super Bowl!My biggest fear is that I won’t be funny enough. If you call into a show, you have to be funny, right? I listen to people call in all the time and crack me up. And even when they aren’t trying to be funny, they’re so inherently funny because of the way they’re talking or the stories they’re telling. And while I am pretty witty, I tend to clam up when I’m put on the spot. My mind always goes blank and I say something stupid. But you know what they say, nothing ventured nothing gained.So, with the big game happening this Sunday, I am going to call in to “You Betcha” and see if I can tell Cari and Sam all about Minnesota Super Bowl traditions.",

The food was cold and the service was so bad that we ended up leaving before we even got our food.I'm not sure if I would recommend this place or not. It really is hit or miss. If you're willing to take a chance, you might have a great experience. But if you're not feeling lucky, I would suggest going somewhere else.Overall, I would say that this place is just average. The food is good, but the service is inconsistent and the atmosphere is kind of weird. If you're looking for a great meal, I would suggest going somewhere else. But if you're just looking for a place to grab a bite to eat, this place is fine.",

So when I heard about this place, which is known for its ribs, I just had to try it. The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, and it's pretty unassuming from the outside. But don't let that fool you, because the food is amazing!I ordered the half rack of ribs, and they were fall-off-the-bone tender. The meat was so flavorful and juicy, and the sauce was just the right amount of tangy and sweet. The sides were also great, especially the mac and cheese. It was nice and creamy, with a perfect amount of cheese.The service was also top-notch. Our server was friendly and attentive, and he made sure that we had everything we needed.Overall, this place is a hidden gem. The food is amazing, the service is great, and the prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some of the best BBQ in town.In fact, I would say that this place is even better than some of the BBQ joints I visited in Kansas City. The ribs were just as good, if not better, and the sides were even better.I'm so glad that we decided to try this place. It's definitely one of the best BBQ restaurants in Madison.I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some great BBQ. You won't be disappointed!",

It may sound a little crazy, but it totally works. The flavors blend perfectly together. I always ask for extra sauce because it is insanely delicious and I want to savor every last drop. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and the sundried tomatoes add a nice tangy flavor to the creamy, rich sauce. I would say this dish is definitely a must-try, especially if you are a fan of creamy pasta dishes. Plus, the portion size is huge so you will definitely get your money’s worth.The service here is always top-notch, but on my last visit, the server took a little long to get to our table. They seemed a little scattered, but the food made up for any small hiccups.Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, the service is usually great, and the food is always delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.Price: $12.50Rating: 5/5",

They loaded it into our car and we were on our way. Installing the toilet was also a breeze.

It uses only 1.28 gallons of water per flush, which is great for saving water.* It's very stylish. The sleek design and the white finish look great in our bathroom.* It's very easy to install.

Our server was rude and dismissive, and he took forever to take our order. When he finally did come around, he got it wrong. And then he argued with me about it! I've never been treated so poorly in a restaurant before.The food was just as bad as the service. It was cold and tasteless, and it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. I couldn't even eat it.I'm so disappointed in this place. I used to love coming here, but I'll never be back again.I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. It's not worth your time or money. There are much better options out there.Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else. You'll be glad you did.This place has really gone downhill. I'm not sure what happened, but it's not the same place it used to be.I'm so disappointed. I used to love coming here, but I can't anymore.If you're thinking about going to this restaurant, I would advise you to reconsider. There are much better options out there.I'm giving this place one star because I can't give it zero.It's really unfortunate because I used to love this place.But I can't keep going back to a place where I'm treated poorly and served bad food.So, that's my review. I hope it helps you make a decision about whether or not to go to this restaurant.",

The atmosphere is casual and inviting, and the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal. The portions are huge, so come hungry. You won't be disappointed. I had the salmon cakes, which were the best I have ever eaten. They were perfectly cooked, with a crispy outer layer and a moist, flavorful interior. The accompanying lemon-herb sauce was the perfect complement to the cakes. I also tried the roasted beet salad, which was equally delicious. The beets were tender and sweet, and the goat cheese and walnuts added a nice touch of flavor. For dessert, I had the chocolate cake, which was simply divine. The cake was moist and rich, and the chocolate ganache was to die for. I savored every bite. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant.

Nearby another table was celebrating a birthday which added to the lively buzz. Our server checked on us regularly to ensure we had everything we needed. For dessert we split the tiramisu which was light and creamy, the perfect ending to the meal. The check came promptly when we asked and overall the service was attentive without being overbearing.

We spent a while in the energy exhibit playing with circuits and generators. After that we checked out the science lab, where there were experiments we could do ourselves under the guidance of museum staff. By this point we were getting hungry, so we ate in the on-site cafeteria. The food was decent for a museum and the kids enjoyed refueling. Feeling re-energized, we headed up to the observation deck with a view out over the city. My daughter liked looking through the telescopes pointed at faraway landmarks. As it was nearing the end of our visit, we wandered through the art studio one last time. On our way out we browsed the gift shop for souvenirs of our educational afternoon.

Uptown Charlotte is known for its variety of high-end hotels that pride themselves on maintenance and customer service. Travelers looking for an enjoyable stay close to restaurants and nightlife have many alternatives that invest more in upkeeping their properties. In the future, I will consider booking with hotels that have a strong reputation for cleanliness and customer satisfaction before defaulting to a name brand based solely on location.

I would highly recommend giving it a try for anyone seeking a top-notch dining experience.",

We stayed very busy prepping food, serving customers, and keeping the dining room clean. The kitchen crew worked hard to prepare all the dishes for the many customers that came in each hour. All of the staff had to multitask and work as a team to handle the high volume of business. I was kept on my toes having to remember orders and requests from multiple tables at once. The servers had to navigate the tight quarters efficiently to deliver meals and refills without getting in each other's way. Most of my coworkers were college students or recent grads like myself just looking for part-time work. The managers worked long hours to keep everything running smoothly during the rushes. At the end of each shift, we were all exhausted but felt good that we satisfied so many patrons. It was rewarding to see customers enjoying their meals and coming back time and time again. The busy work environment made the shifts go by quickly even if we didn't stop moving for hours. Overall, it was a fun place to spend that part of my post-college time even with the long hours on my feet. I'm glad I had that restaurant work experience early in my career.",

However, I was disappointed with the flavour and preparation of the dish. The shrimp seemed overcooked and rubbery, lacking any juiciness or tenderness. The sauce also did not have much flavour, tasting rather bland and forgetting the spices that should highlight po boo dishes. As I ate the meal, I found myself adding more and more hot sauce to try andflavour. The vegetables were fresh but there wasn't enough to balance out the shrimp. Overall, the execution of this classic Thai curry was lacking. The rice was the only redeeming part of the meal. I chatted with our server who agreed the kitchen was having an off night. Based on this experience, I likely won't order seafood dishes here again and may try some other local Thai restaurants instead. Unless the quality improves consistently, I can't recommend this place for authenic Thai cuisine.",

When I arrived on a Saturday night, the parking lot was pretty full which was a good sign. I found a spot and made my way inside. The layout and decor looked much the same as I remembered, with the long bar area up front and more spacious seating and stages towards the back. There was a live band playing some good classic rock covers that had many people out on the dance floor. The atmosphere felt energetic but not too crowded or crazy. I got a beer from the bar and took a look at the menu, seeing their typical burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything seemed reasonably priced for a bar. My friend arrived and we got a table, chatting and enjoying the music for a while. Our food came out pretty quickly after ordering. The wings were tasty with a nice spicy sauce. More people kept filtering in as the night went on. We stayed for a few more songs then paid our tab, which was also reasonable. It was nice to revisit Buckhead Saloon after all these years and see it was still a reliable spot for a drink, music, and some grub on a weekend night. Not much seemed to have changed and it had held onto its appeal. I'd consider returning again next time I'm in the mood for that kind of low-key bar setting.",

Upon arrival, I was struck by the airport's small, intimate size - only two gates served the whole operation. However, what it lacked in size, it made up for with southern hospitality. The staff was exceedingly friendly and warmly welcomed visitors to their tiny airfield. After parking, I took a walk around the perimeter to soak in the scenery. Off in the distance, wide saltmarshlands met the sky, with the blue Atlantic just beyond. As the breezes caressed my face, I could taste the salt on my lips and hear calls of seabirds riding coastal currents. It was the perfect picture of peaceful solitude, a world away from the bustle of major hub airports.

The restaurant had a lively yet relaxing atmosphere, with just the right volume of quiet jazz playing over the speakers, creating a harmonious symphony to enjoy our food to. Our server came over with menus and was friendly and knowledgeable, giving us recommendations based on our tastes. I opted for the seafood paella, knowing Upstream has a deft hand with rice dishes, while my partner chose the salmon pasta hoping for a light yet fulfilling meal. The appetizers we started with did not disappoint - the grilled calamari had tender squid tubes and a delightful lemon caper aioli for dipping. A shared plate of bruschetta featured a beautifully composed arrangement of vine ripe tomatoes, basil and bocconcini on a delicate toast point. Our meals arrived with perfect timing as our plates were cleared. I was amazed at the flavor and texture of each pearled grain of rice in the paella, infused with the savory seafood and spices. My dining companion raved equally about their perfectly cooked salmon, moist and flavorful, served over a bed of linguini in a light yet complex cream sauce. For dessert, we split a trio of mini treats - a chocolate mousse cup, cheesecake bite and creme brulee that satisfied our sweet cravings without leaving us too full.

That's when I noticed a few guyssetting up instruments in the corner - turns out an acoustic blues trio was starting a late night set. I ordered another drink and settled in to listen.

Around midnight they started playing some slower tunes that really filled the room. By that point the crowd had dwindled quite a bit but the half dozen of us left were completely enthralled. At the end of their first song one guy remarked \"Man, these guys are killin' it tonight!\" which made me chuckle.

Breakfast looked pretty sad in the morning - just your basic bagels, yogurt, and granola so we decided to hit up 5Church for something better before heading out. Location is definitely the biggest perk here since you're so close to everything downtown. Oh and the beds were surprisingly comfortable despite the small space! Only other negative was how thin the walls were - you could hear the people in the rooms on both sides very clearly which was a little annoying.

The main issue for me was the space, it was way too small and cramped inside. We could barely move between the tables and felt like we were on top of the other diners the whole time. On a busy night it must feel claustrophobic in there. I also didn't love how loud it got with all the hard surfaces, you really had to raise your voice to be heard.If they'd put even a few plants or photos on the walls it might have felt less stark and industrial but it really lacked character or charm. The music was good but very loud too.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the Instagram shots from the beautiful dishes look great but in reality the ambiance really fell flat for me. It was trying too hard to be a cool hipster spot rather than having its own identity. And honestly, who cares about being trendy if you don't enjoy actually hanging out there?In the end, while the food and service were satisfactory, I didn't really feel like I needed to return. It had the novelty factor the first time around but I can easily pass on it in future.

Don't get me wrong, the food is usually pretty good - their hot n sour soup and mongolian beef are favorites of mine. But man, last night was really pushing it. I walked in expecting the usual, but when I took a seat I could immediately tell something was off. The kitchen was in chaos, with people yelling and pans clattering everywhere. It was totally out of control back there! My server came over looking frazzled and said they were super backed up. When I finally got my food, it was definitely not peak condition. The ma po tofu was watery and bland and I'm pretty sure my lemon pepper shrimp had been sitting under the heat lamp way too long. The piece de resistance though was when I bit into one of their famous banana spring rolls. Except it didn't taste like banana at all...it was overwhelmingly garlic-y. I about gagged, it was so strong. Needless to say I didn't stick around for dessert after that experience. My poor server was running herself ragged trying to keep up but it was just a mess. I felt bad leaving her a normal tip since the service wasn't really her fault, but I just couldn't stomach eating there another minute. Hopefully they've gotten things under control back there since then! But man, what a night ender that was. Not worth the short walk home if it means risking food poisoning from bananas that taste like garlic. I'll be avoiding late nights there for a while until I'm sure the kitchen has their act together again. There's too many other good local spots that won't make me regret eating out!",

Every time I have to call them, I spend at least an hour on hold just listening to horrible elevator music. And don't even get me started on their completely useless automated system. I swear, I just want to cuss out that robot voice telling me the same options over and over. When I finally get a rep on the line, they are never able to help and just transfer me around like a hot potato. It's like they don't even want to solve my problem. Last month when my internet went out, I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just to have the guy tell me someone would come take a look in 7-10 business days. Are you kidding me? A week without the internet in this day and age is torture. I was lucky enough that the first available appointment in that window was on a Friday night. So I had to take time off work just so some clueless tech could come, find nothing wrong, and leave after 10 minutes. Good lord, I just about lost it I was so frustrated. The whole experience was an absolute nightmare and really makes me question why I'm still a customer. At this point I'm about ready to swallow my anger and switch to a different provider just for my own sanity. Has anyone else out there had any better luck with Time Warner or should I be looking elsewhere? This is just unacceptable service in 2020.",

And the lighting is real soft too, not those harsh fluorescent lights you usually see. It's actually a pretty chill vibe in here which is kinda surprising for a Mcdonald's. They even have some art up on the walls too, like paintings of countryside scenes and stuff. I guess management figured out people will hang out longer if they aren't feeling like they're in a fast food joint. Plus they keep it pretty clean in here too, which you don't always see at other locations. Overall it's just a way nicer environment than your average Mcdonald's.

A few other parties that arrived after us got seated before us, which seemed a little inconvenient. When our table finally was ready the server sort of rushed us through the menus to pick our apps and entrees. The appetizers we got were pretty small—two bites each, tops. My partner got the mushroom flatbread that was just okay. I went for the bruschetta that had some weird crunchy bread on it. For our entrees I got the salmon that was seriously overcooked, practically flakes instead of flakes. My dining partner went with the duck which they said was pretty greasy. We also got a side of brussels sprouts that just tasted like sad, steamed vegetables. Our server was in and out, kind of hard to get her attention to ask for refills on our water. When she did come by she messed up our orders a couple times, like bringing me partner's dessert when I was still working on my rubbery salmon. We told her we weren't really feeling satisfied with the meal overall so she took our entree plates without even asking if we wanted boxes. Dessert came and while it looked nice it was just kind of eh. I got the chocolate thing and it was way too rich. When we asked for the check it took another 10 minutes to track down our server. Then she forgot to split the bill so we had to wait again. Overall the experience was pretty meh, definitely not worth the price even with the restaurant week special. Probably won't be back!",

There must have been like 50 different slides, a huge ass wave pool, and even a lazy river that went on forever. We decided to start on one of the more mild tube slides just to ease into it. But after one run, I was like \"screw this kiddie stuff\" and hauled ass to the tallest slide in the whole place. I was pretty nervous looking down from the top but I grew a pair and launched. Holy moly, what a rush! After that I pretty much spent the whole day living on the edge. I tried all the gnarly flume rides where you think you're gonna fly out, and the crazy fast tube slides where you feel like your butt's gonna fuse to the plastic. The wave pool was nuts too when they cranked it up to 11. Gotta admit, almost threw up a few times from all the spinning. By the time we finally dragged ourselves out, I could barely walk straight.

Our server, a friendly gentleman named David, came over to greet us and recommend a few seasonal cocktails. I went with my usual dark and stormy while my partner opted for something sweeter with ginger beer and dark rum. We both agreed it was the perfect drink to complement the jazz quartet on stage.While we sipped our cocktails, we people watched and took in the atmosphere. It really felt like a neighborhood hangout where regulars chatted with one another or focused on the stage. At one point, some newer patrons near us complained the music was too loud, which got some eye rolls from others closer to the band.

This airport has three concourses that are well-spaced out and easy to navigate between. Be sure to use any security checkpoint as they usually have the shortest lines. Don't forget you can also skip the lines by enrolling in TSA PreCheck or Clear if you travel a lot. Once through security, be on the lookout for the many local food options - you'll find everything from pizza to pho to snacks from favorite city brands. When it's time to head to your gate, the airport's mobile app and electronic signs clearly show terminal assignments and how far each walk will be. If running late, don't panic as most gates here seem to board late and the free electric carts are a quick ride between concourses. Speaking of rides, be sure to budget extra time if renting a car as the rental lots are located off-site - plan for a 10 minute ride each way. The airport recently added a lot of charging stations which are much appreciated on long layovers. Be warned that WiFi can get bogged down during peak travel times so have some downloaded entertainment as a backup. Also, keep an eye out for exhibition spaces featuring local artists - it's a nice break from the usual airport clutter.

Heard the special dessert of the night recommended so of course I had to get one to take home too. Bill came and we all split it evenly, didn't seem too outrageous all things considered. Heads up, it can definitely add up with drinks and apps so budget accordingly.Overall it was the perfect spot to celebrate with coworkers old and new at the end of the year.",

The bartender greeted us promptly, but it took over 10 minutes for her to take our drink order. We ordered a round of beers and waited patiently for our drinks to arrive.After 20 minutes, we still hadn't received our beers, and our bartender seemed to have disappeared. We tried to catch the attention of other staff members, but they were all busy with their own tables.Finally, a manager noticed our frustration and came over to apologize for the delay. He explained that they were understaffed and that our bartender had gotten overwhelmed with orders. He offered to comp our drinks and promised that our food would arrive quickly.We ordered our food, but it took over 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive. Our entrees took even longer, and by the time they arrived, it was almost 9 PM. The food was cold and lackluster, and we were both extremely disappointed.The manager came by to check on us again, and we expressed our dissatisfaction with the service. He apologized and offered to comp our meal, but by that point, we were just ready to leave.We won't be returning to Harris Grill anytime soon. It's unfortunate that a place that used to be one of our favorites has gone downhill so much.",

They offer a wide selection of flavors, including some unique and creative ones that I've never seen elsewhere. The presentation is also impressive, with each dessert carefully decorated and presented in a visually appealing way.I've tried a few of their cupcakes, and each one has been moist, flavorful, and had just the right amount of sweetness. My favorite is probably the red velvet, which has a perfect balance of flavors and a delicious cream cheese frosting. Their chocolate cupcakes are also amazing, with a rich, deep flavor that's satisfying but not too overpowering.I've also tried a few of their other desserts, like the lemon bars and the brownies, and they're just as delicious. The lemon bars have a perfect balance of sweet and tart, and the brownies are fudgy and chocolatey without being too dry or crumbly.The best part about this place is the service. The staff is friendly, welcoming, and always willing to help with any questions or concerns. They also offer custom orders and catering, which is great for special occasions or events.Overall, this place is a must-visit for anyone with a sweet tooth. The desserts are delicious, the presentation is impressive, and the service is top-notch. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to satisfy their sweet cravings.",

We were seated at a cozy table by the window and presented with menus. Our waiter, a friendly and attentive young man named Max, came over to take our drink order. I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and my brother got a beer. We perused the menu and decided to share a few appetizers. Max brought us a delicious charcuterie board with a variety of meats, cheeses, and crackers. We also ordered the roasted beet salad, which was out of this world! The beets were perfectly cooked and the goat cheese was creamy and delicious. For our main courses, my brother got the steak frites and I ordered the duck confit. The steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were crispy and salty. The duck was tender and flavorful, and the polenta it was served with was creamy and rich. We both cleaned our plates and were stuffed by the end of the meal. Max came over to ask how everything was and we raved about the food. He suggested a dessert wine to go with our chocolate mousse and creme brulee. We ended up getting both and they were divine! The perfect ending to a fantastic meal. The bill was reasonable and we left feeling happy and satisfied. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal in a cozy atmosphere. We will definitely be back!",

The sign outside still sports the classic, cursive \"Green's Lunch\" lettering, and the interior is adorned with old-timey advertisements and vintage memorabilia. It's easy to imagine that little has changed here since it first opened its doors in 1946. nnYou'll be greeted by the friendly proprietor, who'll ask how many in your party and seat you accordingly. Don't be surprised if there's a bit of a wait, especially during peak lunch hours, but trust us, it's well worth it.nnThe menu is simple, with only a handful of options, but everything is expertly prepared and served with a generous helping of nostalgia. You can't go wrong with the classic burger, cooked to perfection and served on a soft, fresh bun. The fries are crispy and flavorful, and the onion rings are a definite highlight. nnBut the real star of the show is the milkshakes. Oh, the milkshakes! They're hand-dipped, just like your grandmother used to make, and come in a variety of flavors that will transport you back to a simpler time. nnIf you're feeling particularly hungry, try the \"BIG\" breakfast platter, which includes two eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries, toast, and a pancake the size of a manhole cover. It's enough to feed a small family, and then some.nnThe best part? Prices are laughably low, with most items on the menu costing less than $10. It's a true bargain in a city where $15 sandwiches are becoming the norm. nnSo, the next time you're in the area, do yourself a favor and stop by Green's Lunch. It's a reminder that sometimes, the simplest things in life are the most enjoyable. And who knows? You might just spot a famous face or two, as this place has been known to attract celebrities and athletes looking for a quick bite of old-fashioned goodness. nnIn conclusion, Green's Lunch is a must-visit for anyone in the Charlotte area.",

He had never tried it before, but after one bowl, he was hooked. So, when we were planning our trip to Montreal, I knew I had to take him to Pho Bang.We arrived around 6 pm on a Wednesday, and the place was packed. There was a short wait for a table, but it was worth it. The restaurant was dimly lit, with a cozy atmosphere. The decor was simple, but elegant.Our server was friendly and attentive. She helped us navigate the menu, and recommended the special of the day. My dad ordered the pho tai, and I got the pho with flank, brisket, and tripe.The broth was rich and flavorful, with a deep beef flavor. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the meat was tender and juicy. My dad couldn't stop raving about his pho tai. He said it was the best he'd ever had.I was a bit disappointed with my beef, but the broth made up for it. It was well-flavored and not greasy, which I appreciated. I also loved the shrimp spring rolls we ordered as an appetizer. They were huge and filled with fresh shrimp.The service was quick and efficient, and our server was always smiling. The prices were reasonable, and we left feeling full and satisfied.Overall, Pho Bang exceeded our expectations. It's a must-try for any pho lover, and I can't wait to go back. My dad is already planning his next trip to Montreal, just so he can have another bowl of their delicious pho.",

The weather is definitely a welcome change, and I'm enjoying the abundance of outdoor activities that are available year-round.One of my favorite things to do is hike, and Arizona has some of the most beautiful hiking trails I've ever seen. The Superstition Mountains are just a short drive from where I live, and I've hiked up to the top of Siphon Draw Trail a few times now. The views from the top are breathtaking, and it's a great workout.Another thing I love about Arizona is the food scene. There are so many amazing restaurants and food trucks, and I've been trying to try as many as possible. I'm a big fan of Mexican food, and there are some great places around here that serve delicious tacos, burritos, and other Mexican dishes.One of my favorite places is a food truck called America's Taco Shop. They have a variety of tacos, burritos, and other items, and everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious. The carne asada tacos are my favorite, and the salsa is fresh and flavorful. They also have a great atmosphere, with friendly staff and a quaint setting.I've also been to a few breweries in the area, and they're all great. SanTan Brewing Company is one of my favorites, and they have a great selection of beers. I'm a big fan of their Mr. Pyro's Apothecary Ale, and it's a great place to hang out and watch a game or meet with friends.Overall, I'm really enjoying my time in Arizona. The weather, the outdoor activities, the food scene, and the friendly people all make it a great place to live. I'm looking forward to exploring more of what the state has to offer and making new memories with my friends and family.",

The atmosphere was elegant and intimate, with dark wood paneling and chandeliers. The service was impeccable, and the food was exceptional.

The food was delicious, with bold and vibrant flavors. The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively and energetic. We especially enjoyed the Thai Red Curry, which had a nice balance of spicy and sweet.Finally, we went to Eleven, a contemporary American restaurant in the Cultural District. The decor was modern and chic, with a sleek bar and exposed brick walls. The service was professional and knowledgeable, and the food was creative and inventive. We ordered the burrata, which was served with fresh bread and a side of fruit, and the roasted beet salad, which was sweet and earthy.Overall, we were very impressed with the food scene in Pittsburgh.

The scenery along the route is also beautiful, especially when traveling through the Allegheny Mountains.However, the train's on-time performance has been inconsistent. There have been times when the train has been delayed by several hours, which can be frustrating, especially when you're trying to make connections. I've also noticed that the train's Wi-Fi can be spotty at times, which can be a problem if you need to work or stay connected during your trip.Another issue I've encountered is that the train's food and beverage service can be hit or miss. Sometimes the food is delicious and the selection is good, but other times it's been less than impressive. And don't even get me started on the prices - $5 for a small bag of peanuts? Really?Despite these issues, I still prefer taking the train over driving or flying. It's a more relaxing way to travel, and you can't beat the views.

As we were browsing, we noticed that the prices were quite high. We were expecting to spend a bit more since we were looking for quality furniture, but the prices seemed excessive.We went back to the sales associate and asked her if they had any other options in our price range. She showed us a few more pieces, but they were not what we were looking for. We explained our budget to her and she said that they didn't have much in that range.We decided to leave the store and look elsewhere. As we were leaving, we noticed a sign that said \"Up to 50% off all furniture\". We asked the sales associate about it and she said that it was a mistake, they were not having a sale. We were upset because we had been looking forward to getting a good deal.We left the store feeling disappointed and frustrated. The sales associate was friendly, but the selection was limited and the prices were too high. We will not be returning to Walter E Smith in the future.In conclusion, our experience at Walter E Smith was not satisfactory. The store had a limited selection, high prices, and a disappointing experience with a sale sign. We will not be recommending this store to our friends and family.",

The exterior looked like your typical fast food joint, but the interior was surprisingly colorful and lively. We were greeted by a friendly staff and the smell of freshly made tacos filled the air.I ordered the Crunchwrap Supreme, which came with a generous amount of beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. The tortilla was crispy and flavorful, and the beef was surprisingly tender. My friend got the Quesarito, which was essentially a cheesy burrito wrapped in a tortilla. It was a bit messy to eat, but the flavors were rich and satisfying.We also tried the Nachos BellGrande, which was basically a mountain of nachos topped with beef, cheese, jalapenos, and sour cream. It was a bit overwhelming, but the nachos were cooked to a perfect crisp and the toppings were generously portioned. Overall, we were both impressed with the quality of the food and the friendly service.The only downside was the price - our meal came out to be around $20, which was a bit steep for a fast food meal. But considering the generous portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients, it was worth the splurge. We left Taco Bell feeling satisfied and full, ready to take on the rest of our adventures in Las Vegas.",

The decor was nice, modern and clean. The menu offered a good variety of Thai dishes and we were eager to try their signature dishes. We ordered the Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, and Green Curry. The Tom Yum soup was flavorful and spicy, just the way we liked it. The Pad Thai was a bit disappointing, it lacked the wow factor and was a bit too oily. The Green Curry was delicious, the chicken was tender and the curry sauce was rich and creamy. We also ordered a side of steamed rice, which was perfectly cooked. The service was attentive and our server was knowledgeable about the menu. The price was reasonable and we would definitely come back to try their other dishes.

When we asked for refills on our drinks, we were met with a dismissive attitude and had to wait an unreasonable amount of time.

You're just going to have to deal with it.\"I was taken aback by her attitude and politely asked her if she could help me find anything else.

The savory crepes are perfect for a quick breakfast or lunch, and the sweet crepes are ideal for a dessert or snack. I've tried the ham and cheese, spinach and feta, and the mushroom crepe, and they're all so good. The crepes are made fresh in front of you, and you can watch the crepe maker expertly flip and fold the dough. The ingredients are all high-quality and fresh, and you can taste the difference. I've also tried some of their coffee drinks, and they're all excellent. The service is always friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is cozy and intimate. I've brought friends and family here, and everyone has loved it. I highly recommend Crepes Parisiennes to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic French crepe experience.

The portions are generous, so you'll never leave feeling hungry.I've tried several dishes at Girasole, and every single one has been delicious. The pasta is cooked to perfection, with a nice balance of flavors and textures. The sauces are rich and full-bodied, with a depth of flavor that is hard to find elsewhere. The pizza is also excellent, with a crispy crust and a flavorful sauce that is made fresh daily.The best part about Girasole is the price. For the quality of food and service you receive, the prices are incredibly reasonable. You can get a filling and delicious lunch for under $15, which is a great value in my opinion.Overall, I highly recommend Girasole for a quick and delicious lunch in a cozy and welcoming atmosphere.

The flavors were completely off balance, with the rhubarb overpowered by an excess of ice and a lingering aftertaste that was borderline unpleasant. It was a disappointing start to our meal, and not a great sign of things to come.Moving on to the appetizers, the Potstickers were a surprise hit. They were perfectly cooked, with a delicate balance of crispy and chewy textures. The filling was flavorful and savory, with a depth of umami that left me wanting more. The dipping sauce was also a highlight, with a tangy and slightly sweet flavor that complemented the potstickers perfectly.The Lettuce Wraps, on the other hand, were a bit of a miss. The lettuce was limp and lacked any real crunch, and the filling was uninspired and lacking in flavor. The dish felt like a bit of an afterthought, and I couldn't help but feel that the kitchen could have put more effort into it.Moving on to the entrees, the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap was a real standout. The bowl was filled to the brim with a variety of colorful vegetables, all cooked to perfection. The rice was fluffy and well-seasoned, and the runny fried egg on top was the perfect addition. The sauces were also well-balanced, with a nice balance of spicy and sweet flavors.The Vietnamese Beef Noodles were also a hit. The noodles were cooked just right, with a nice chew to them. The beef was tender and flavorful, and the broth was rich and savory. The dish felt like a authentic representation of Vietnamese cuisine, and I couldn't help but feel impressed by the restaurant's ability to execute it so well.Overall, the meal was a bit of a mixed bag.

I'm not even exaggerating when I say it's the best dessert I've had all year. I mean, have you ever tasted something that's simultaneously rich, nutty, and slightly crispy? It's like a party in your mouth, and everyone's invited.The presentation is also on point - it's like a work of art, almost too pretty to eat. Almost. But trust me, you'll want to dig in as soon as possible. The texture is perfect, with a satisfying crunch on the outside and a creamy, velvety center. And the flavors? Oh man, it's like a symphony of sweet and savory. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in every bite.I'm not a huge fan of burnt things, but in this case, it really works. It adds a depth of flavor that's missing from other desserts. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good almond? They're like nature's perfect snack.The only problem is that now I'm ruined for all other desserts. I mean, what's the point of even trying anything else when you know this exists? It's like, why settle for less when you can have the best?I'm not sure what kind of magic they're using at Shadyside, but they need to bottle it and sell it. Stat. Because honestly, this dessert is worth any price. I'd pay top dollar for a slice of this heaven.The only thing I can compare it to is a classic New York cheesecake, but even that's not doing it justice. This is like, next level. It's like a cheesecake and a brownie had a baby, and that baby was raised by unicorns and fed on rainbows.Okay, I know I'm gushing, but seriously, this dessert is the real deal. Do yourself a favor and go try it. Now. Like, drop everything and go. You won't regret it. And if you do, well, we can't be friends anymore.Just kidding, but seriously, this burnt almond torte is the bomb.com. You won't find anything better, I promise.",

We had been on the road for hours, and the anticipation of finally arriving at our destination was building up. As we entered the city, the first thing that caught our attention was the skyline. The skyscrapers rose majestically into the sky, their sleek and modern designs a testament to the city's growth and progress.We made our way through the bustling streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. The traffic was heavy, but the drivers were friendly and courteous, giving us a warm welcome to the city. As we approached our hotel, we couldn't help but notice the beautiful architecture and landscaping that surrounded us. The hotel staff was friendly and efficient, checking us in quickly and directing us to our room.Our room was cozy and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed and all the amenities we could need. We freshened up and decided to explore the city, starting with the famous NASCAR Hall of Fame. The museum was filled with interactive exhibits and historic race cars, giving us a glimpse into the world of racing and its rich history.After spending a few hours at the museum, we decided to grab some lunch at a nearby restaurant. The food was delicious, with a mix of southern comfort food and modern twists on classic dishes. We ended our meal with a slice of pecan pie, which was the perfect way to cap off our first day in Charlotte.With our bellies full, we headed to the Levine Museum of the New South. The museum told the story of the South's history and culture, from the Civil War to the present day. The exhibits were informative and thought-provoking, giving us a deeper understanding of the region and its people.As the day came to a close, we headed back to our hotel, feeling grateful for the warm welcome we had received from the city.",

And let me tell you, if you're a beer lover like me, you owe it to yourself to check out this amazing German restaurant in the heart of the city.From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was lively and welcoming. The decor was traditional German, with dark wood paneling and colorful steins lining the walls. We were greeted by a friendly server who showed us to our cozy booth and handed us a menu that read like a guidebook to German cuisine.I was excited to see all the familiar dishes from my travels in Germany, like bratwurst and sauerbraten. My husband, who's a big fan of sauerkraut, was in heaven. We ordered a few lagers to start, and let me tell you, they were poured to perfection.The server was attentive and knowledgeable, answering all our questions about the menu and making recommendations. When our food arrived, we were blown away by the portion sizes. The bratwurst was generously served with a side of sauerkraut and potatoes, and the sauerbraten was fall-apart tender.We also tried the schnitzel, which was crispy and flavorful, and the spätzle, which was cooked to a perfect al dente. And of course, we had to try some of the desserts. The apple strudel was out of this world, with a flaky crust and a sweet, juicy filling.Throughout our meal, we chatted with the friendly staff and enjoyed the lively atmosphere. The restaurant was bustling with activity, but the service was never rushed or impersonal. It was like dining with old friends.Overall, this German restaurant is a treasure.

I was a bit hesitant, as I'm not a huge fan of tomato sauce, but I was willing to give it a try.When the dish arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The tomato sauce was rich and flavorful, but not overpowering. It was a great combination.I also ordered a side salad, which was fresh and crisp. The dressing was light and tangy, and it complemented the flavors of the salad nicely.Throughout my meal, the service was attentive and friendly. My server was knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant.

The meat was tough and chewy, like it had been sitting in a corner for weeks. And don't even get me started on the flavor. It was like they took all the spices and threw them out the window. I could barely taste anything except for a hint of salt. Like, seriously, who seasons their meat with just salt? And the sauce, oh boy, it was like they just dumped a can of tomato soup on top of the ribs. I mean, I've had better sauce at a kid's birthday party. The texture was all wrong too. It was like they just threw some cornstarch at it and hoped for the best. Needless to say, I left the restaurant feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. I mean, I've had better meals at a fast food joint. The service was decent, though. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, even though he had to deal with my complaints about the food. So, that's my two cents. Avoid the short ribs at all costs. But hey, maybe their other dishes are better. I'll give them another chance someday. Who knows?",

The air conditioning was blasting at full force, making the room feel like a walk-in freezer. We tried to adjust the thermostat, but it seemed to be stuck on \"arctic blast\" mode.We tried to ignore the cold and settled in for the night, but it was impossible to get comfortable. The bed felt like a block of ice, and the sheets were so stiff they could have been made of frozen pizza dough. We tried to snuggle up and warm each other up, but it was no use. We were shivering and our teeth were chattering within minutes.Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse, we heard a strange noise coming from the bathroom. It sounded like someone was playing a game of basketball in there, but when we went to investigate, we found that the toilet had somehow become possessed and was flapping its lid open and shut like a demented, porcelain bird.We decided to call the front desk and report the issue, but the phone in our room was dead. We tried to use the hotel's Wi-Fi to book a new room, but it was slower than a sloth on valium. We were stuck in this frigid, haunted room with no way to escape.As the night wore on, things only got weirder. The TV started playing the same episode of \"The Price is Right\" over and over again, and the lights in the room began flickering like they were trying to signal us something. We tried to ignore it and go to sleep, but it was impossible.Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the sun started to rise and we could see the light of day peeking through the curtains.",

All in all, it was a great experience and we would definitely go back to Sports Rock Cafe again. In fact, we already made plans to return the next time we're in Pittsburgh!",
