I savour the taste of her liver, the texture of her still pumping heart as it gushes with the soft velvet touch of blood in my mouth. Her body twitches still, the last remnant of life seeping out of her. I relish it. I quiver with delight when I think of what her thighs will taste like, her uterus, the traces of urine in her bladder... But not now. Beside her, a phone screen lights up, a single text message catches my eye. \" Sara, where are you? What did Megan need help with? \" I leap with delight to answer it, smearing blood on the screen as I do so. My fingernails are soiled and rotting. \" Megans craigslist date ate her alive. She' s pretty upset. \" \" Aww, poor thing. Should I come over? \" \" Please do. \" \" Ok, I got ta finish work, but I' ll be there in an hour! see you! \" I ca n' t help but cackle wildly as I toss the phone with reckless abandonment. One more! I can barely believe it! What luck! I drag her lifeless body over to the other two, the fat mother and the starving daughter. Their faces are contorted in agony but I could barely tolerate eating either one completely, as their extremities in weight caused the feasting experience to suffer. As I dump her body onto the heap of meat I can almost swear I hear a breath. A whisper. A quiet whimper from the girl. Impossible. I set to rummaging about the house for a mop to clean up the mess as I wait for my next course to arrive. I whistle while I work. I even sing a little.",

You want some damn good ice cream. nnI went for all five reasons, and I wasn't disappointed. Wait. That doesn't express the depths of my enthusiasm for Klavon's. KLAVON'S RULES!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! There, that's better. nnLet's take it in order. You have lots of dining options in the Strip. Now, Klavon's is a few blocks away from most of the popular places (we were at Salem's, which is also great, but that's another review), but it's easy to walk to and easy to find with all the neon signs. nnWhen you walk in to Klavon's, you're taken back in time. Choose a little booth or table, and gaze at the decor. Maybe you'll see an old liniment bottle from back when Klavon's was a drugstore. Maybe you'll notice the high-water mark from the 1936 flood (close to the ceiling! ). Maybe you'll see the old penny scale or the phone booths. This is a place where history is celebrated. nnThe menu isn't extensive, but you still have lots of choices. Why not try an old-time phosphate, malted, or egg cream? It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason? Both the root beer and the ice cream were made locally. On the way out, why not browse the penny candy racks? For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats. nnI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place. A glipse of his epic mustache alone is worth the visit, but he's always willing to give you a tour. Friendly people in friendly Pittsburgh.",

He was painfully stuck in the present, unable to come to terms with why his actions had resulted in his incarceration. He had no way to contact her. He was forbidden from writing or phoning her. He knew even if he was able to get a message out it would be intercepted by her parents. They hated him more than anyone. He dreampt about her every night and hoped that one day they would be back together. He was weak and could barely lift his head, but on her birthday he asked a guard if he knew how she was doing. The guard hesitated.

And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago.. . They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not. nnI had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili. nnNow, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty! nnAnother plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili! )nnNow the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco. nnOverall, not bad, food is average.",

IHowever, it was filled not only with bread but an inventory of dips, chutneys, sauces, etc. They also have a cart with dry soup mix that is gluten free and looked pretty tasty. nnI wasn't sure what to get there so I went with Rosemary Garlic loaf to get something with flavor. This girl cooks a lot of Italian food so I am sure I can incorporate it in a meal somewhere. They have toaster and round loaves-which just mean the size of the loaf (I had no clue what they meant when they asked this so I just said toasted in an inquisitive way). Their bread has no artificial ingredients or preservatives and according to their website, shouldn't be refrigerated but can be frozen (they gave me extra bags when I told them I want to freeze mine). nnThey also have a bread card where you buy 12 loaves, you get one free. When I saw others put three $$$ for price on here, I don't agree. The loaves are about $5 a pop and most bread at the supermarket is an average of $3 so I don't think the price is too high, especially for freshly baked bread without preservatives or artificial ingredients.

That' s how it began. I' m how it ended. I was born 49 years ago. The mind transplant breakthrough was new and scientists were eager to test it' s limits. I was an orphan, and two weeks into my life Technology became my parents. I do n' t remember the first mind fusion. Nor the second, the third, or the fiftieth. They all occurred before I was two years old. Before I knew who I was, I shared my thoughts with fifty other sentient beings at the same time.

The luminescent glow shone into the quickly developing night. A man put the finishing touches on his masterfully crafted scene before sitting down and waiting. This beach was quite a romantic spot. The condo' s owner had been nice enough to grant him a secluded section on the beach for the evening, free of charge. He looked out over the now darkening water. Minutes soon passed into hours. Periodically, the man would hear a noise, thinking it was her, but it always turned out to be nothing. The man wept into the bouquet of flowers he had been holding for her. Yet still, he held out hope that she would come. As day broke across the sea, he gave up those last shreds of hope. Dejected, he carried his flowers away. The beautiful scene he had so meticulously created in the very spot where they had met all those years ago was all for nothing. Seeing him walk away, the recently hired concierge spoke, rather heartbroken to the condo' s owner. \" All of that work and those wasted hours, and she still did n' t come. The poor guy must really have done something awful to deserve this. \" \" I did n' t expect her to come, \" replied the manager. The concierge seemed rather taken aback by this. \" Really? Have you lost all your hope in humanity, \" she asked. He answered, \" Well, she has been dead for seven years now. When she died, something snapped, you know, mentally. He builds this scene every year, and waits for her to come. I always let him use this space. I' ve never had the heart to tell him the news.",

First of all the sheer number of souls is a problem. I have one boat. It holds at max 5 souls. With so many deaths I never get a day off. I barely get a bathroom break. Second these little twits do n' t usually have payment. I' m not sure when this stopped up top, but they have been lacking in their burial duties. I expect payment. No begging, no bargins. I do n' t do it. So they either wander the shores for 100 years or they pay up. Some find the coin. Others dont. I think I might have a solution however. I' m thinking expansion. A few more boats. A few more ferrymen. It could work. See I take those poor unfortunate souls who ca n' t pay, and instead of wandering the shore for 100 years, they work for me for 50 years. It' s a win win. I know I' m supposed to be the ferryman, but I need a break. Or at least a lull. So I' m aquiring some more boats. Finding mythical boats that can traverse the river is not an easy task. I' ve had to enlist the help of some higher ups, it' s getting done though. Next I get to try to find the time to explain the deal to the dead. I think many would enjoy it.

The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad. However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.

After soaping my self and washing it off i notice little spots of blood also in the shower so i jump out and check my teeth and there is blood trickling out of my mouth, and then i see a small little girl black hair big eyes smiling at me in the corner of the mirror, i quickly turn round and there she is looking at me beedy eyes smiling, i bolt to the door of the bathroom slipping on the blood thats now gushing out of my mouth and slam heavily on the floor.

Admittedly, I have changed so much in the last five years I do n' t even think her warm brown eyes could even look at me the same. I was no longer the man I once was, my face showed I was tired, silver streaks in my hair, and I was working a job I did not love. I can just imagine her though. Brown eyes and a smile that illuminated in darkness. Her outgoing, loving spirit could even make the devil smile. Her hands were always soft to touch and fit perfectly in mine. She was always full of life when we were together, with big dreams that took her all over the world. I often wonder where she would be now. Eventually, the red flare of dusk all but vanished and it was time to leave. I stood up, stretched and looked around. This place use to be so vibrant and natural, the lots were developed and filled to quickly. It seems every year it gets more crowded and is forced to expand. I knelt down and laid my flower in her eternal bed with a letter attached. I kissed her headrest and laid my head against it. Closing my eyes I envisioned the last time I saw her as I do so often in my dreams. We were one hundred and fifty feet in the air zip-lining across a ravine. \" See you on the other side my love \" she yelled, grinning from ear to ear, shooting down the line, so full of life.",

Several came up in my search but I noticed that the BBQ King was on triple D and the best thing I ever ate. So BBQ King it was and the plan was to try the BBQ chicken. nnWhen we landed in Charlotte on a Sunday and they were closed. So, on the return we gave ourselves a little time to check out the BBQ King. It's an old school drive-in with an intercom ordering system. I thought it was kind of cool. What first struck me looking at the menu was the lack of BBQ items. I saw burgers, steak, fried chicken and similar drive in type items. But I didn't worry because I had a plan to try the BBQ chicken; and for good measure I choose the minced BBQ sandwich. nnWhen the food came, I was surprised the BBQ chicken was fried chicken covered in BBQ sauce. It then dawned on me that in the Carolinas BBQ is pork; like the minced sandwich I ordered. Unfortunately, in my search for good BBQ, the BBQ King was not going to be my fix. But I had to try the food. I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was vinegary and the meat was moist and tender with a nice crunch. I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good! They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked. I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich. nnWould I recommend BBQ King? It was unique enough that with full disclosure yes. Would I go back again?

Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing.

However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. nnThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner). And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.

The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. The food was.. . okay. Nothing to write home about. I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades. And this is average - at best. I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden. It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best. And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was. nnBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check. They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals. Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section. It reads (until 3: 00 p. m. ). What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday. Really? REALLY? Are you kidding me? That's B. S., no matter how you view it.

Very interesting.. not Italian but really good. . but I would rename it Bacon Lo Mein.. . My Husband ordered the Lasagna, he said it was good but the meat was stringy?? Our friends had the Pollo Romano, which was basically a Chicken Parm, it was a great size portion, and seemed like our friend enjoyed it. Her partner had the Cotoletta ala bolognese, it was a fried chicken cutlet topped with Parmesan cheese and proscuitto, It was also a nice size portion but it was swimming in grease, like the cheese had melted and they used to much oil to fry it.. they did replate it for my friend but she could still not eat it and they very nicely took it off the bill. nThe desert.. .. was the VERY best thing on the menu--NUTELLA PIE.. It was a combo of Nutella, peanut butter, marscapone cheese with a graham cracker crust.. . heavenly, I would have eaten more but I had filled up on the bread! nAll in all.. its a okay dinner place.. . not authentic Italian at all.. Large family style portions, but not my AMORE.. . Loved our company.. not so much the meal..",

The condo' s owner had been nice enough to grant him a secluded section on the beach for the evening, free of charge. He looked out over the now darkening water. Minutes soon passed into hours. Periodically, the man would hear a noise, thinking it was her, but it always turned out to be nothing. The man wept into the bouquet of flowers he had been holding for her.

Two machine guns were to be brought up later as a last effort, but somehow several thousand bullets seemed useless in the face of these beasts. Even tank shells that hit the things directly were said to have no effect. A knock at the attic door alerted the two soldiers, and one quickly put down his rifle to open it. A young postal worker greeted him and handed over a small piece of paper. The soldier read it over as he sat down. \"What does it say? \"The other asked. The first soldier handed the piece of paper over and said, \"It seems the horsemen are more confident than we are. It' s an order for 100 skins once this is all over. Machine gun is being dropped off right now. \"The second soldier read the paper quickly. Once finished he looked up and said, \"… Is that it? Are we at war now? \"The first soldier nodded and picked up his rifle. He set it against the roof for stability and motioned for his comrade to do the same. Both picked a target, waiting for the command to fire.",

I though, am the closest thing to a god. I have the ability to manipulate the future and therefor, manipulate entire universes and the masses that populate them. I first discovered this power in the 1930' s when Adolf Hitler decided to enter art school. The future told me that he would create a painting that would sway the ideas of an entire generation and thus, set technological advances back by decades. I decided to intercept his art letter and create a fake rejection letter. As you all know, Adolf Hitler instead was able to begin the Third Reich. Whenever I would change the future, I would only cause more harm. Now though, I foresee Earth as a molten rock, entirely devoid of life. I can not allow for life on Earth to end, but how? I think for ages while staring at my old chessboard. How? How? How?! How can I save the Earth without creating an even more terrible fate? It torments me. Saving the world without giving it an even worse fate? It suddenly dawns upon me that I must do what I never wanted to do: I must further speed up the end game of Earth' s death. So I do just that, I convince people that gas does not hurt our Earth much, I convince people that global warming is nothing more than a myth, and I convince the politicians to ignore it all. I do these horrendous things to push people to see the future as I did and attempt to change it themselves. If every good action I do ends up creating an even worse future, than every evil action I do should end up creating an even better future.",

Parents still bought their kids that stuff. There was, of course, a huge scare after what happened to me. Headlines all over the world. No one ate bubble gum for years, companies went bankrupt. Scientists took samples, all the rest. Eventually they solved the problem. Mine was a dodgy batch, the vast balloon the result of some special-radiation-exposure or some such nonsense. Boom. Back on the shelves, new brands, new names. By then most people did n' t much care about me, they' d all figured it had neer happened before, why should it happen again? So, there I was, 30 years later. I was well looked after, and I should be thankful for that. The Bill Barnet centre still brought in enough money to keep my tubes full of' food' and water, so I' m alive. I was thankful for that. For a long time. Hard to stay that way though, 30 years in. 30 years trapped under a sticky, unbreakable bubble, mouth comically open, breathing air pumped in through a tube. They determined that the bubble was n' t removable pretty soon after the incident. Turns out whatever had happened meant it went as far into me as it did out into the space above me. The bubble was part of me. My body had started to take it in. They could try to take it off, but chances are I' d just die. 30 years, I said \" Ok then. I' ll stay here. \" That was 30 years in. Now, it' s the 31st anniversary, and I' ve written the letter.",

Their job was simple, infiltrate axis cities, disrupt/destroy propaganda music playing throughout the city, then escape. The 101st division is here today because of their heroic actions during their campaign against concentration camps. This will be the first ever detailed account of one of their missions In the cover of darkness one man equipped a silencer onto his bagpipe and blew softly into it. The tiny faint image of a blue man holding a sword appeared and began work cutting the electrified fence link by link. One by one the twelve man division went through the hole and the small blue man disappeared along with his sword. The men did n' t have to look long for the propaganda. Considering the glowing red colossus of a german solider was patrolling the camp as german propaganda blasted from the loud speaker. The division had to use their advantage of surprise quickly or they might lose it. So they all blasted the Irish songs of old as their sound appeared rising taller than the solider wielding sword and shield glowing a bright blue. The red sound pulled up his gun and fired into the blue sounds shield puncturing it. The blue raised the sword above his head and brought it down on to the slower red german cutting it from the right of its neck to the left of its stomach. The propaganda immediately silenced and the red dissipated into the night. The blue continued to the front gates ripping it open as the prisoners fled into the safety of night. This is but one example of the many missions the 101st division executed with out mercy or remorse which is why today we honor them with the gilded guitar award for bravery.",

I am devastated to have failed in my duty to my hero. \"Though Whitmire's open letter to his \"dear friends\" has been reprinted in various outlets, his original blog post no longer appears to be accessible.Whitmire has worked with the Muppets since 1978 and also provided the voice of Sesame Street's Ernie, of Bert and Ernie fame.Matt Vogel, a seasoned Muppet performer who used to assist Whitmire while he was playing Ernie, will take over as Kermit from next week.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.",

The two mortals lived prosperously, until the deceitful devil tricked them into eating the forbidden fruit, from the Tree of Knowledge. After both of them had their bites, reality splurged in. They were naked. They were alone. There' s a voice that tells them what to do. The Creator, disappointed of their actions, banished them from the Heavens. As the Kingdom of God was separated from Earth, man became much more sinful. Crime. Lust. Greed. Everything came about. But, when the people started making idols, and worshipping them instead of God, he was pushed into his limits. There came Yahweh, a stricter God, for an undisciplined time. He made heroes and prophets. He used magic and legends. He brought the He in Hero, but, there was something missing. Man needed much more intricate help. They need a Messiah. As the cold rain poured, Mary and Joseph were searching for a place to rest. The census was made, and they were desperate. Inn after Inn, they were not given entry, but a humble stable was supplied unto them, by God. Mary was promised to give birth the new Messiah, son of the Living God, and then began the era of Jesus Christ. Now a father by nature, God is pushed to be much more sensitive and understanding, but still shows his power through his miracles, but time passes by. Years after Christ' s ascension, God was not felt. He did not make miracles or such. He did not speak to people. He did not bring any heroes or prophets. He was just there. There came no proof of his existence, and the people' s belief on him soon faded away. But, still, many took part in his faith. Many held unto him. Why? Because, he is there. He was.",

Then one day, a mischievous girl came to my window and beckoned me away. She was beautiful, interesting, lovely. I was dreaming. I had to be. But no; this little, miniature woman flew high above me and taught me how to move through the air like she could. She pulled me along while we flew through London, soaring over the city. We would do this nightly, and every morning, exhausted, I would take myself to work. It was worth it, though, and I never said no. And one night, she gripped my finger, her tiny hands barely wrapping around it. She tugged to indicate I should follow her, and... I did. I never looked back. Neverland is truly a place where childhood dreams come true. I found a crew, and we sailed, fighting bad guys and finding treasure, with my little fairy on my shoulder. She always had a temper, though. It was part of her feisty personality, and I loved it... until she decided she was bored of our life. And then she flew off, and I never saw her again. Until a few years later. A few troublemakers had begun running about Neverland, harassing people and stealing treasure I' d buried. My crew and I decided to teach him a lesson- nothing bad, just tell him to knock it off. He was just a kid, after all. And as we approached him, I suddenly saw her, sitting on his shoulder. My Tink. She had left and found another Lost person without a family and brought him here, to our place, to my dream land. I guess I lost a part of myself that day, and Neverland was never the same.",

I saw fear and he saw death. The fire rising in me. I would hurt him like he hurt me. I dug my thumb deep into his eye socket. I felt the squish and pops as I dug deeper. His shrieks echoed through the warehouse. Screams no one would here except me. Screams that would haunt me for the rest of my life. Constantly reminding me what I have done but I was oddly okay about it. I was knuckle deep in his eye when I pulled out. The blood spraying at me. A pool of crimson formed around us. His ungodly scream startled me for a second. Now it was time to end this. I reached for my coat and pulled out a small picture. He knew exactly who they were. He was responsible for their death. It' s always the innocents that get killed. The intoxicated drivers always survive. But not always, for today I am death. And I am here for him. My hands wrapped around his throat for one last time. I could feel the life slipping from him. He did n' t struggle. He laid limp staring at me. Begging for mercy, he almost looked sorry. But that was to late. My family may of looked sorry and look where they are now. I have become judge, jury, and executioner. His body fell imp on the ground. His life drained. I stood there looking at what I have done. A calming feeling overcame me.",

However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time.",

Global warming, super viruses, global drought - all of these things humanity was happy to push off onto the next generation, keeping them out of sight and out of mind so they could focus on staring into a screen with their fingers in their ears while the world crumbles around them. So it stood to reason that in the early years of the 21st century, when the great exodus occurred, a mass migration of four billions souls that would return in two hundred years time, humanity was willing to brush it off on the next generation. And the next. And the next. See, the funny thing was that the plan would have worked, earth would have been saved by the exodus, if it had n' t already been too late. Even with half the population suddenly absent there still was n' t enough water, food, and farmable climate to sustain them, and they slowly died off. The survivors began to tell tails of the saviors, and angels who would come and take them with them on their great ships into the stars where they could live without threat of starvation. Then that fateful day came. Two hundred years after the exodus the great ships appeared in the sky of earth in a flash. The cults dedicated to their saviors return called out in joy, dancing in the streets. Finally they could leave their hellhole, their misery, and join the angels. Unfortunately for them that is what the ships also saw. A hellhole. It only took a brief scan of the planet for them to realize that there was nothing for them here. The world they were banished from had done them a favor.",

It's a good thing my friends love me because I pretty much ate half their salmon.. .. I mean to be fair I shared my pizza!

I quickly turn on my back awaiting the retaliation from the man. As I settle on my back, the man casually steps above me peering down at me. That is when I notice it, it was n' t him that looked familiar, it was my clothes. He appears to be wearing the clothes I slept in. Just as I start to open my mouth he peers straight into my eyes and says \" You want to come into my house and act like me with my wife, then I figured it is only fair to do the same with your wife. \"",

I had told myself I would n' t follow them, that I would let them die at his hands. I had lied, I usually did. I looked away from the crystal and left my home. It had taken years to construct with no reasonable magic to aid me, I tried to keep it camouflaged, and at the end of those three months I managed it. A fine home, decorated with pearls from the mollusks around the island' s shallows and crystals from the caves. It was nice, to have built something for once. To create instead of destroy. Of course without my raft I was without my transport. I glanced around looking for an answer, I knew what had to be done, but I did not like it. Of course, I worked past it, and I turned on my heel. I obliterated my house in an instant, my work shattering to pieces, pearls splintered and crystal shattered around me, the door was reduced to little more than fiber. And as the chaos settled, one wall was intact, one I had made to remain intact. I lifted it from the sand, muscles honed from a year of hard living making it easy work. I took a wide stance and step by step made it to the sea, where I threw the wall into the surf. It bobbed briefly before settling on the surface. I stepped onto it, carefully, and I balanced carefully in the middle. I reached behind myself with both hands, fire licking my fingers. And I bid farewell to my island.",

The effort it took this time to unfreeze myself has almost reached my limits... and the exhaustion had gotten too much now. How long will this go on I wondered... It had been almost a year now... a year filled with remarkable growth. Hah! the crazy therapists... would have taken me a lifetime to get this smart & strong. But the occult book has been my saviour. Ever since I learnt to use its techniques on myself, ive gotten smarter and stronger faster and faster. I no longer need to sleep so much, have the strength of a bear, speed of a cheetah and can think of a hundred ways to confuse where once I was a shy loser. I just need to overcome this last hurdle of locking up. That crazy shaman has been right so far... ( and the same old fear creeps up the spine )... no... I will get back to my family as soon as I am done. There are only so many demons one could have absorbed into oneself. One every day has surprised me... but I remember being in a coma like trance for only a week after my deal... Never mind... enough of living like a hermit here in the jungle. And so, its time again for the same routine... wash up in the river, hunt some deer... no rabbit today... cook, eat, catch up on some news hoping the world finds some cure for this strange epidemic of sloth, sleep, get up, exorcise.... But as this night closed in, and the warning of the shaman against godly delusions echoed in my whole being, I felt as if I was becoming night itself. Frantically, I search my memories, trying to overcome my self-induced forgetfulness. But the freezing this time was absolute...",

The corporate apartment comes with a fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots and pans. There is also an iron and ironing board. There is also a 22 inch? CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels. I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay. The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me. They did not offer me a chance to pay for it. nnThe fitness room was nice. There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines. There are even a few sets of dumbells. I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that. nnThere is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly. There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company. You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned. This is rather expensive as well. Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.",

I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints. Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff. It greatly lacks attention to detail. I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo.. . and so on). The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains). I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room. This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason. I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work. I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out. All of the power in the room was then knocked out. This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous. I was lucky my computer was not fried. The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu. I then crumpled the menu and threw it away. The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow. I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up. Outrageous. Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers. During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\".",

I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, \"ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting. \" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for. nnThen, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's.

I know for a fact that every Thursday they fly in many choice ingredients directly from Italia. This creamy delicacy is by far my best loved. It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy. The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra.

I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints. Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff. It greatly lacks attention to detail. I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo.. . and so on). The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains). I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room. This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason. I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work. I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out. All of the power in the room was then knocked out. This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous. I was lucky my computer was not fried. The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu. I then crumpled the menu and threw it away. The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow. I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up. Outrageous. Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.",

Granted, none of them are gourmet, but for bar food, it was okay. And the portion sizes? Huge! Ordered some cheese fries and the plate of waffle fries was piled high and smothered in cheese, scallions, tomatoes and ground beef. Almost like a nachos plate. nnWant a beer? Rather than tell you what kind she has the bartender will point to a display across the room that you can pick your favorite from. It was my least favorite move of the night, as the service up to that point was pretty good. Had it been me ordering that- I might have pushed back. As for my friend? He just glanced and ordered. nnAnd finally- the ambiance. Dark. Dark wood and dark lighting. This is a guy's place and if you are walking by the outside looking in- you may think the place is empty, but take a peek inside.

His soul, now free from his body, stood deathly still, eyes wide open, much like the man. However this man was free of any humanly features other than a face and body. His soul was much more handsome than the man before him. The killer ran off with the mans wallet, but the soul nay took a glance. He took a few seconds, seemingly trying to find the punchline in this cruel joke life had given him. When his ghostly shoulders sagged, defeated, I put a finger to his chin.

It did n' t take long for me to start noticing that other people around were having the same conversation, at various points throughout the week. That brings us today. Today, I met somebody new for the first time. He came into town, and just started talking to everybody. Literally. He made the rounds around the place, saying something to everybody. Sometimes the conversations were short. But other times, he would actually take out a notebook to write down important parts that the people were saying and mark points on a map. He was a truly fascinating person. He came up to me, but I was too scared to say much of anything to him. I was content just watching him do his work.

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner. The home planet of the human race was silent. One day we may learn of Earth' s fate, but that day is n' t today. Today is the day the last of humanity unites. Today is the day the first United Human Government is sworn in and presents to us the Declaration of Mars... **From this day all citizens of Mars belong to one colony.

And when he did, he knew he had to go out and help people. He was the town' s newest superhero, Prose. And the other man its newest villain, Blitz Talk, who decided to start his reign of terror only a few days ago. \"I will win this battle, and you won' t be able to tattle. I rise to greatness, as you become nameless! \"Prose yelled out. He immediately felt the power well up inside of himself. Anything that Prose rhymed became the truth. An odd ability, but a powerful one nonetheless. \"I' ll walk away successful and you' ll be regretful. I' ll be the best and you' ll fail your quest. \"Blitz Talk' s words came out rapidly, quickly canceling out Prose' s abilities. The thing was, whenever Blitz Talk rhymed, he could do the same as Prose. But he had to speak faster than Prose, who had to slowly take his time. The two continued to go at it for hours. And then it occurred to Prose what he needed to do to end this battle. \"Stop right there. I just figured out how to make you run out of air. You think your rhymes are so magnificent, but you aren' t all that brilliant. I' m sure your mom said you were special, but when I' m done with you, your tongue will be tied like a pretzel. \"Prose stood victorious as Blitz Talk responded. \"You think you are so great, but you fail to realize that you' ve taken the bait. In my trap you fall, a long nap awaits you all. When I' m through with this town, you will be remembered as only a clown.",

I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter. It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me. nnFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos. We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it. At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well. So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos. They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking. For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples. Upon receiving the salad I dug in. The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad. However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad. Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples. She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left. I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred. It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.",

As the Ethereals are the closest thing to gods, they watch over our every action, recording and analyzing. Over the eons I have learned that the Ethereals can not reproduce, and seem to fabricate our souls and run them through a battery of simulations to determine if we are worthy of ascendence. Fortunately, I have been a very successful Buddhist monk for several of my recent cycles, and a philosopher in three others. The Ethereals seem to be taking a liking to me as each cycle I have been able to select more extravagant life features. However, I think they are more interested that I declined to opt for the upgrades and stuck with the minimum to get my goals done. After all, it' s harder to become a monk when living in Las Vegas. A strange light caught my attention nearby. And choatic orange, black and red light burst from a soul chamber near me. The poor soul as destabilized.

I typed furiously doing my own AMA telling everyone how awesome this whole thing was. I honestly thought reddit would be here long after my skills had deteriorated and I could no longer see the screen. A year or so ago facebook went the way of myspace. And myspace is so far out of sight now that when you ask someone who is younger if they know what it is, they assume you are talking about something in the phone book days. I mean, come on! Who gets phone books delivered to their house printed out on paper! That' s just stupid! Anyway, I should have known then that we were becoming a thing of the past. Our user base was down. A lot, it turns out. But I thought it was fine. People would rediscover how awesome reddit was. People would flock back to us like hipsters flocked to oversizes glasses in the 10' s. But it does n' t look like anyone is coming. So today is the last day of reddit. Today I shut down the servers and walk away. Tomorrow, reddit will be a thing of the past that people will talk about with a loving remembrance but nothing more. There are new sites now, and maybe we will get mentioned on some of them. An old interview. An old meme. Something. So, to anyone left out there ( if there is anyone out there still ) AMA. I am the last reddit employee and I will be shutting down the servers in a couple of hours. What do you want to know? What do you want to remember?",

There's a $20(? ) deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week. We'll see. If you've read my other reviews, I NEVER have great luck with these \"deposits. \"nnAbout the room: n-It's not new. But it's not old, either. n-There's a tube tv circa 1999, no fridge OR microwave OR coffee machine. Those things you'll have to specifically request (for a fee! ). n-The walls? Terribly, terribly thin. I'm nervous about going to sleep tonight.. .. and waking up in the morning. n-Couple of hairs floating around the room. The bed, the lamp shade.. . and the shower wall was COVERED in them. Speaking of the bathroom.. . n-Not cleaned. At all. Somebody's draws were on the door (I took a pic). The aforementioned hairs all over the shower wall. And there's no way in the world they could've cleaned that bathtub.. .. it definitely hasn't seen any kind of cleaner in a while. The draws on the door were enough for me; I showered with a towel on the tub floor cuz I just didnt want to touch anything in there. nnYou'd think as long as they took to get me a room here, the room would be sparkling! Now I'm starting to think all they did was make the bed, fold some towels, and move on. nnI really wanna just leave here and sleep somewhere else, but I already paid for the room.",

It's clear that corners are being cut and quality is being sacrificed in the pursuit of profit.To add insult to injury, the prices have been steadily increasing over the past few months.

Her eyes, clouded with age, held a glimmer of wisdom and anticipation. \"Do you want the good news or the bad news?\" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. I hesitated, unsure of the significance of her choice. With a gentle smile, I replied, \"Tell me the good news, Grandma.\" Taking a deep breath, she began weaving her tale. She spoke of a hidden treasure buried deep within the family estate, a fortune that could change our lives forever. I sat in awe, imagining the possibilities that awaited us. Before I could even digest the enormity of her revelation, she paused and looked at me intently. \"But,\" she whispered, \"with great wealth comes great responsibility.\" Her words lingered in the air, and I knew that the bad news would carry an important lesson. \"What is the bad news, Grandma?\" I asked, my voice trembling slightly. Her grip tightened on my hand as she spoke, her words tinged with sorrow. She shared the secret that had haunted her throughout her long life—the burden of a family curse. Generations ago, a pact had been made, and its consequences had followed us ever since. I listened, spellbound, as she recounted tales of tragedy and misfortune that seemed to align with our family's history. I felt a chill run down my spine, realizing the gravity of the choice I had to make. Would I pursue the treasure, risking the ramifications of the curse? Or would I let it remain hidden, protecting future generations from its grip? With a heavy heart, I asked my grandmother, \"What do you want me to do, Grandma?\" She gazed at me with a mix of love and sadness, her frailty emphasizing her wisdom.",

That's when I remembered the holy water I had in my pocket.I quickly pulled it out and threw it at the Devil, hoping it would at least weaken him.

I was trembling with fear, wondering what I had done.But to my surprise, God was not angry with me. In fact, he seemed almost... grateful. He explained that the Devil had grown tired of his role and had been looking for a way out.He told me that he had chosen me to replace the Devil, to be the new ruler of the underworld.

I found Mrs. Johnson in what used to be the teacher's lounge, now a dusty shambles. Her hair was gray and her face was wrinkled, but those scornful eyes were unmistakable. \"Well, well, if it isn't little Jimmy,\" she sneered. \"Come to finally admit you'll never amount to anything?\" I threw back my head and laughed. \"You thought I was nothing, but take a look outside. This world, this entire planet, it all bows to me now,\" I said. Her mouth fell open in disbelief. I hadn't come all this way just to gloat, though.

The lack of such an establishment is particularly noticeable on weekends, when residents and tourists alike are looking for a welcoming spot to enjoy a fresh, hot bagel and a cup of coffee.The closest thing Pittsburgh has to a privately owned bagel shop is a small bakery that produces a limited selection of bagels, but even these are not always available. This is a disappointment for those who crave the warm, chewy texture and rich flavor of a freshly baked bagel, straight from the oven.Furthermore, the absence of a privately owned bagel joint means that Pittsburghers are missing out on the opportunity to experience the vibrant, bustling atmosphere that such a shop typically provides. There's nothing quite like the smell of freshly baked bagels, the sound of friendly chatter, and the warm, inviting ambiance that makes you feel like you're part of a community.It's not just the locals who are affected by this absence; visitors to the city are also missing out on a unique and authentic experience. When travelers come to Pittsburgh, they expect to find a variety of local eateries that offer a taste of the city's culture and cuisine. Unfortunately, the lack of a privately owned bagel shop means that visitors are forced to settle for chain stores or cafes that don't quite capture the essence of Pittsburgh's culinary scene.One can only hope that some entrepreneurial spirit will rise to the challenge and open a privately owned bagel shop in Pittsburgh soon.",

Bypassing security was trivial for me, and soon I proudly held a rare orange tang under my arm.

Panic gripped my chest as I realized I couldn't remember how I got there. \"Help me,\" I whispered into the darkness, hoping someone would hear. There was no response except for an eerie silence that engulfed me. I strained my ears, desperate for any sound. Suddenly, a faint voice echoed through the room, barely audible. \"Who's there?\" I called out, my voice trembling. \"Help me,\" the voice pleaded again, more audible this time. It seemed to come from a corner of the room. Determined, I groped my way towards it, feeling along the walls for any kind of exit. As I reached the corner, my hand brushed against cold metal, and I realized it was a doorknob. With a surge of hope, I turned it, and the door creaked open. I stepped out into a dimly lit corridor, still unsure of where I was. Voices echoed from the end of the corridor, drawing me closer. I followed the sound, my heartbeat pounding in my ears. As I reached the source of the voices, I found myself in a room filled with people, all trapped like me. Their pleading eyes met mine, and I knew we had to find a way out together. We formed a plan, shared our fears, and refused to give in to despair. With courage and determination, we searched for clues, unlocking hidden doors and avoiding traps. Slowly, we discovered the secrets of our captor and realized that only by working together could we escape this nightmare. Days turned into weeks as we fought for our freedom, giving each other strength when hope wavered. Finally, we discovered a hidden passage leading to daylight. Tears filled our eyes as we stepped out into the open, free at last.",

The snow-capped peak towered above us, and the sunset casting a golden glow on the landscape was truly breathtaking. We took the bullet train to the base of the mountain and then transferred to a bus that took us up to the fifth station. The ride was smooth and efficient, and the views from the window were stunning.At the fifth station, we got out to explore and take some photos. The air was crisp and clean, and the silence was only broken by the sound of cameras clicking and people chattering excitedly. We walked around the observation deck, taking in the panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.We then took the opportunity to visit the shrine located at the fifth station. It was a serene and peaceful place, and we were able to learn about the history and culture surrounding Mt. Fuji. We also saw many people making offerings and praying for good fortune and safety on their climbs.After spending some time at the shrine, we headed back down to the base of the mountain and visited the Fujiyoshida Sengen Shrine. This shrine was dedicated to the god of Mt. Fuji and was surrounded by beautiful forests and tranquil gardens. We spent some time exploring the grounds and learning about the history of the shrine.Next, we headed to the Fuji Five Lakes region, which offered stunning views of Mt. Fuji from the water's edge. We took a boat ride on Lake Kawaguchi, and the views from the lake were simply incredible. We could see Mt. Fuji's reflection in the water, and it was a truly magical experience.After the boat ride, we had lunch at a local restaurant and tried some delicious traditional Japanese cuisine, including sushi and tempura.",

The sound of rustling fabric and shuffling footsteps echoed from inside.The door creaked open, revealing an old man with a long, white beard and piercing blue eyes. God smiled warmly at Death. \"I have been expecting you,\" God said, his voice low and gravelly.Death nodded, his skeletal hands clasping his scythe tightly. \"I have come to collect your life, God. \"God sighed, his eyes misting up with sadness. \"I know. I have lived a long, full life. It is time for me to rest. \"Death stepped forward, his scythe glinting in the fading sunlight. God closed his eyes, ready to meet his fate.But as Death raised his scythe to strike, a strange feeling overcame him.

He saw the beauty and wonder of creation, the love and compassion that had gone into every detail.Death hesitated, his scythe wavering in mid-air. \"I cannot do it,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.God opened his eyes, surprise etched across his face. \"What do you mean? \"Death took a step back, his scythe slipping from his grasp. \"I cannot take your life, God.

Strangely, I had no recollection of writing it. The handwriting was mine, but the content was chilling.The note spoke of dark secrets, hidden desires, and ominous warnings. It hinted at deeds I couldn't fathom committing. My mind raced, desperately trying to piece together the puzzle. How could I have written such a thing? Was it a sick joke?

Its massive form stretched across the forest floor, caked in moss and covered in a colorful array of wildflowers. Once a magnificent symbol of strength and resilience, the giant now lay defeated. The creatures of the forest gathered around, their curious eyes filled with a mixture of sadness and wonder. How had this mighty giant come to such a fate? Legends whispered of fierce battles between rival giants, of thunderous clashes that shook the earth. But as time wore on, it became clear that this giant's downfall was not the result of a battle, but of age and the trials of time. For centuries, the giant had stood tall, its branches reaching for the sky, offering shelter and solace to countless creatures. Squirrels would scamper along its majestic frame, birds would nest in its lofty branches, and children would gather beneath its shade to listen to magical tales. Generations had grown up with the giant as a silent, steady companion. It had witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, silently standing as a witness to the passage of time. But nothing lasts forever, not even giants. As the giant slowly crumbled, the forest animals realized that they had taken its presence for granted. They had become so accustomed to its steady presence that they had failed to appreciate its beauty and strength. Now, with the giant fallen, a void loomed over the forest. The animals began to understand the importance of the giant's existence, and their hearts swelled with gratitude for the shelter it had provided. In a collective effort, they began to pay homage to the fallen giant. The birds sang melodies that resonated through the woods, while the deer laid delicate flowers around its form. The squirrels scurried up and down its trunk, chattering tales of bravery and valor.",

Grunge music was taking over the airwaves and flannel shirts were all the rage. Everyone was glued to their TV sets watching Friends and listening to Nirvana blast from their discmans. Technology was also advancing at a rapid pace. Many people got their first computers and started exploring the nascent World Wide Web for the first time. Meanwhile, movies like Pulp Fiction and The Matrix were blowing audiences' minds with their groundbreaking styles. The fashions of the 90s were incredibly fun and colorful. Neon colors and padded shoulder clothes defined the era. JNCO and acid wash jeans were must haves for any high school or college student. Gelled spiked hair was extremely popular for boys while girls sported loud prints and platform shoes. Toy collecting was also a big phenomenon during that time. Beanie Babies flew off shelves and everyone had to have a Tamagotchi or a Furby. The economic boom years of the 90s created a very optimistic time despite growing up under the ever present shadow of the Cold War. Things felt fairly carefree for most as unemployment was low and the stock market was doing great. However, the decade was also marked by events like the LA riots, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the Columbine school shooting which served as tragic reminders that not everything was perfect. By the late 90s, Britney Spears and the boy bands like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys had become the new pop royalty. Teen movies hit their peak with the American Pie franchise and shows like Dawson's Creek catered directly to Generation Y. As the millennium approached there was a real sense of excitement for the future but also nostalgia for the fun times of the past decade.",

It's a great club with a lot of history and tradition. \"I'm looking forward to getting started and playing my part in helping the team to success. \"Myhill, who has played for Wales at Under-20 and Sevens level, is a mobile and physical hooker with a strong scrummaging game.He is also a good lineout operator and has a decent kicking game.Myhill is likely to compete with Kristian Dacey and Matthew Rees for the starting hooker berth at Cardiff Blues.He is also likely to be involved in Wales' Six Nations squad next year.Myhill's signing is a boost for Cardiff Blues, who are looking to build on a disappointing season last year.The region finished 10th in the Guinness PRO14 and were knocked out of the Challenge Cup at the quarter-final stage.Myhill is confident that Cardiff Blues can challenge for silverware next season. \"We've got a good squad and I think we can challenge for trophies,\" he said. \"We've got a lot of experience and a lot of young talent coming through.",

It was a strange, yet exhilarating feeling, like a switch had been flipped and suddenly, I could do things I never thought possible.But there was a catch - my superpower only worked when I was holding my breath. At first, it was a little awkward, but I quickly learned to adapt. I would hold my breath and focus my energy, and amazing things would happen.I could lift heavy objects with ease, run faster than ever before, and even fly! It was a rush like no other, the feeling of soaring through the air, the wind rushing past me.But, of course, there were also challenges. I had to be careful not to hold my breath for too long, or I would pass out. And sometimes, in the heat of the moment, I would forget to breathe altogether.Despite these challenges, I embraced my superpower and the thrill it brought me. I used it to help those in need, lifting people to safety during natural disasters or stopping criminals in their tracks.People began to call me \"The Breather,\" and I liked it. It was a name that commanded respect, a name that inspired awe.But with great power comes great responsibility, and I knew I had to use my abilities wisely. I couldn't just go around using my superpower for personal gain. I had to think of the greater good.So, I started a team, a group of people with their own unique abilities. Together, we worked to make the world a better place. And though my superpower was still a secret to the world, I knew that I was making a difference.Years went by, and I continued to use my power to help others.",

It was evident that the ingredients were not of the highest quality, which was surprising considering the positive reviews I had heard about this place.Furthermore, the presentation of the sushi was lackluster. The rolls were sloppily assembled, with loose fillings and uneven portions. It was visually unappealing and made me question the attention to detail in the kitchen. Additionally, the soy sauce provided tasted watered down and lacked the typical umami flavor I expected.As the meal progressed, the disappointments continued. The miso soup was overly salty, and the edamame lacked flavor. It felt like the restaurant was cutting corners on even the simplest dishes.

The room spun around me, and I sank to my knees beside Eric's lifeless body. Tears streamed down my face as I tried to comprehend the enormity of my mistake. The weight of guilt pressed heavily upon my shoulders. I had just taken the life of someone I cared about deeply. Flashes of memories flooded my mind—laughter, shared secrets, countless adventures. All of that was gone now, shattered in an instant. The realization hit me like a freight train. I couldn't change what had happened, but I had to face the consequences. I reached for my phone and dialed 911, my voice trembling as I explained the situation to the operator. The minutes stretched out into an eternity as I waited for the police to arrive. When they burst through the door, their expressions filled with alarm and caution, I knew my life would never be the same. The interrogations that followed were a blur of questions and accusations. I cooperated fully, desperate for them to understand that it was an accident. But deep down, I knew the punishment awaited me. The days turned into weeks, and the weight of my actions grew heavier with each passing moment. The courtroom became my new reality—a place where judgment and justice would be served. I pleaded for mercy, recounting the series of events that led to that fateful moment. The faces of Eric's family, ravaged by grief, haunted my dreams. Finally, the jury retired to deliberate, leaving me to agonize over the outcome. Guilty, they proclaimed. The word echoed in the courtroom, sealing my fate.",

Every time I looked in the rearview mirror, I saw a pair of headlights behind me, but whenever I stopped, they disappeared. I was starting to get tired, so I pulled over at a run-down gas station to grab a coffee. As I walked in, the bell above the door jingled, and the attendant looked up from his magazine. He was a tall, lanky man with a scruffy beard and a dirty hat. He eyed me suspiciously as I approached the counter. \"What can I get ya?\" he asked gruffly. I ordered my coffee and handed him a twenty-dollar bill. As he handed me my change, he nodded towards the back of the store. \"You might want to check the bathroom before you leave,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. I looked at him curiously, but he just shrugged and went back to his magazine. I took my coffee and walked towards the bathroom. As I pushed open the door, I heard a strange noise coming from inside. It sounded like someone was struggling to breathe. My heart started to race as I stepped inside, and that's when I saw her. She was lying on the floor, her eyes closed, and her chest heaving. I rushed over to her and knelt down, but as I reached out to touch her, she opened her eyes. They were completely black, like two voids in her face. She looked up at me, and I felt a chill run down my spine. \"You shouldn't have stopped,\" she whispered, her voice husky and menacing. Suddenly, the lights flickered and went out, plunging us into darkness. I heard footsteps coming closer, and I knew I had to get out of there. I tried to stand up, but my legs felt like jelly.",

Can you imagine? I mean, talk about mind-blowing! I heard it from my friend, Sarah. She's always up to date with the latest gossip, so I trust her sources. According to her, scientists stumbled upon this crazy revelation while they were conducting some advanced research. They found out that the whole universe is just a tiny project for this alien boy named Zorgon. Now, I don't really understand all the science behind it, but it seems like Zorgon created our universe as part of his school assignment. I guess he wanted to show off to his alien classmates or something. Can you believe the audacity? Sarah said that Zorgon's project was supposed to explore the concept of life and evolution, so he set up this vast experiment with billions of galaxies, stars, and planets. And here we are, just some lab rats in his cosmic experiment. Feels kinda trippy, doesn't it? I continued speaking with Sarah, and she told me that Zorgon isn't even paying much attention to his project anymore. He's a bit blasphemous, you know? Apparently, he's onto some new robot-building craze these days. So, I guess our whole existence is just sitting there while he tinkers with his latest gadgets. It makes you wonder, right? What is the purpose of it all? Are we just a speck in this alien kid's science fair display? Does he even care about what happens to us? I mean, I don't think he realizes the impact his project has on our lives. Sarah mentioned that some people are feeling a bit disillusioned after learning about this whole experiment thing.

Panic gripped my chest as I realized she might not have made it. I cursed myself for not being by her side, for not being there to protect her.

Torquay's goalkeeper, Shaun MacDonald, made several impressive saves to keep his side in the game, while Southport's defenders were guilty of some sloppy errors that allowed Torquay to threaten their goal.In the end, it was a moment of individual brilliance that decided the match. Torquay's top scorer, Adebayo Azeez, picked up the ball on the edge of the box and danced past several Southport players before unleashing a powerful shot that found the bottom corner of the net.The goal sparked wild celebrations among the Torquay players and coaching staff, who had been under pressure to deliver a positive result. The win lifts Torquay up to 19th place in the National League, still perilously close to the relegation zone, but with renewed hope that they can climb the table in the coming weeks.For Southport, the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow. Despite a spirited performance, they were unable to turn their dominance into goals, and their search for a first win of the season goes on. They remain rooted to the bottom of the table, seven points adrift of safety.Torquay's manager, Gary Johnson, praised his team's resilience and determination after the match. \"We've been working hard in training, and it's paid off,\" he said. \"We knew it was going to be a tough game against Southport, but we stayed focused and got the job done. \"Southport's manager, Mike Phenix, was left to rue his side's missed chances. \"We should have won that game,\" he said.",

We were immediately seated at a very comfortable booth, the service was top-notch, and the new menu was impressive. We ordered a variety of entrees, all of which were delicious and artfully plated. My personal favorite was the scallops & risotto, and the homemade pastas were also fabulous. My husband enjoyed the seafood stew and raved about the perfectly cooked lobster. The portions were generous and we ended up taking some home with us. For dessert, we tried their famous chocolate cake, which was sinfully delicious and a must-try for any chocolate lover. I also tried their signature \"Orange Dream\" cocktail, a refreshing blend of orange liqueur and vodka, and it was the perfect complement to my meal. Overall, we had an excellent experience and will definitely be returning soon. The new RR is a great addition to the area and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special dining experience. The renovated space is modern and inviting, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure that our every need was met. It's clear that the new owners have put a lot of thought and effort into creating a truly special dining destination. In addition to the delicious food and excellent service, RR also offers a great selection of wines and cocktails to pair with your meal. Whether you're in the mood for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends, RR is sure to please. I highly recommend making a reservation in advance, as it can get quite busy, especially on weekends. Overall, our experience at RR was nothing short of exceptional and we will definitely be back again soon.",

While our friends drifted off with each other and others throughout high school, Emma had remained a constant by my side. I knew every freckle, every smile, every thought in her mind.

These birds were just as impressive as the owls, their sharp talons and powerful wings a testament to their hunting prowess. I was thrilled to see them up close, and the knowledgeable staff were on hand to answer any questions I had.After spending some time observing the raptors, I decided to take a break and grab a bite to eat at the on-site café.

And those elegant wings, so delicate and graceful, fluttering effortlessly in the breeze. Compared to them, we're just these awkward, clunky beings stumbling around. But here I was, on this intergalactic cruise ship, surrounded by these ethereal creatures, and they couldn't get enough of us. They flocked around the humans like bees to honey, captivated by our every move. It was as if we held some sort of mystical charm, something intangible that drew them in. Even the captain of the ship, a towering creature with vibrant feathers and piercing eyes, approached us with utmost respect. \"Humans,\" he said, his voice a melodic harmony, \"you are unparalleled in your beauty. It is an honor to have you on board.\" I blinked in disbelief, trying to grasp the magnitude of his words. Me, beautiful? I might as well have been born with gills. It was all too surreal. As I explored the ship, I couldn't help but overhear snippets of conversations between the aliens. \"Their eyes hold the secrets of a thousand galaxies,\" one said, awe-struck. \"And have you seen the way their laughter echoes through the cosmos? It's like music to my antennas,\" another marveled. I exchanged puzzled glances with my fellow humans.",

I went here with my hubby last night and oh man, it did not disappoint. First of all, the ambiance is on point. It's got that cozy, welcoming vibe that makes you feel like you're in someone's home, but not in a creepy way. They've got the lighting just right, the music is chill, and the decor is modern and stylish without being too try-hard. But let's be real, the real star of the show is the food.So, we started with the mozzarella sticks and oh my god, they were incredible. They were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and had just the right amount of seasoning. We could have easily made a meal out of those alone, but we wanted to try some pizza too. We ordered the Meat Lover's pizza and it was seriously the best pizza I've ever had. The crust was cooked to perfection, the sauce was tangy and flavorful, and the toppings were generous and delicious. I mean, who doesn't love a good pepperoni and sausage combo? And don't even get me started on the cheese - it was like they poured a vat of melted, gooey goodness all over the top.But what really made our experience stand out was the service. Our waiter was super friendly, attentive, and knowledgable about the menu. He made great recommendations and was always quick to refill our drinks or answer any questions we had. It's clear that the staff here take pride in their work and want to make sure their customers have an amazing experience.Overall, I'm so glad we decided to give this place a try.",

Things don't get much better in high school. I'm barely passin' classes and spendin' more time sneakin' out at night than doin' my homework.

It's tough but I'm finally turning my life around.They fast forward through a lot of struggle and hard work but over time I really do turn things around. Get a better job, build a new life, even start tentatively reconnectin' with my son. By the end I can see I'm at peace, helping others like me. Sitting there watching it all, I gotta say...I'm kinda proud of the guy I became. All the angels are looking at me now. \"So, where does he go?\"",

The place had an eerie atmosphere, dimly lit corridors, and a musty smell in the air. It felt like stepping into a forgotten world. As I walked deeper, the walls whispered stories of what had once been. Dust-coated relics filled every corner, artifacts from a bygone era. But where were the corpses? Suddenly, a voice echoed through the halls, \"Welcome, brave souls, to the Museum of Ancient Tombs.\" My heart skipped a beat. The voice belonged to a docent, dressed in a long, black robe. She explained that the corpses were not real but lifelike replicas, meticulously crafted to preserve history. Relieved, I proceeded to explore the exhibits. Each room held a different era, each corpse telling a tale. They were frozen in time, forever preserved in their final moments. The stories they could tell if only they could speak! Intricate details adorned the figures, from the expressions on their faces to the folds in their clothing. It was like peering into a time capsule. I admired the craftsmanship and dedication that went into each display. The realism was uncanny. I couldn't help but wonder about the lives the replicas represented. Who were they? What had they experienced? Snap! I turned around to find a fellow visitor, holding a camera. The flash illuminated the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

With bills piling up and his savings dwindling, he struggled just to put food on the table for himself and his dog Coco. More and more, his thoughts turned to the hearty meals his grandma used to cook. Man, how he missed her lasagna and homemade bread. But it had been years since he'd had a home cooked meal. These days it was just cereal or canned soup, if he was lucky.One night, as he stared longingly into his nearly empty fridge, an idea started forming in his head. What if...what if he just didn't eat? If he stopped spending the little money he had left on groceries, it could buy him another few weeks, maybe a month. By then, surely something would turn up, right? It was a desperate plan, but Bob was feeling desperate. And so he embarked on his hunger strike of one. At first it wasn't so bad, though Coco seemed to look at him with sad, puzzled eyes, as if she knew something wasn't right. Within a week Bob was constantly lightheaded and weak. Still no job leads. By the end of the second week he could barely drag himself from the bed. Coco nuzzled and whimpered at his side, as if begging him to eat, but it was too late now. He had gone too long. The last thing Bob remembered was staring into Coco's big brown eyes, wishing he could explain. Then everything went black. When he opened his eyes again, he was somewhere entirely different. Bright sunlight warmed his face as the most heavenly scent filled the air. Was that...lasagna?",

To make matters worse, the prices are way too high for what they offer. I wouldn't mind paying a premium for a truly exceptional coffee experience, but Katerbean falls far short of that mark. Their prices are exorbitant, especially when you can find better options just a few blocks away. It's like they expect customers to pay for their lackluster coffee and subpar service.

        "text": "When I heard that they had done a renovation, we decided to give them another try. We were immediately seated at a very comfortable booth, the service was top-notch, and the new menu was impressive. We ordered a variety of entrees, all of which were delicious and artfully plated. My personal favorite was the scallops & risotto, and the homemade pastas were also fabulous. My husband enjoyed the seafood stew and raved about the perfectly cooked lobster. The portions were generous and we ended up taking some home with us. For dessert, we tried their famous chocolate cake, which was sinfully delicious and a must-try for any chocolate lover. I also tried their signature \"Orange Dream\" cocktail, a refreshing blend of orange liqueur and vodka, and it was the perfect complement to my meal. Overall, we had an excellent experience and will definitely be returning soon. The new RR is a great addition to the area and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special dining experience. The renovated space is modern and inviting, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure that our every need was met. It's clear that the new owners have put a lot of thought and effort into creating a truly special dining destination. In addition to the delicious food and excellent service, RR also offers a great selection of wines and cocktails to pair with your meal. Whether you're in the mood for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends, RR is sure to please. I highly recommend making a reservation in advance, as it can get quite busy, especially on weekends. Overall, our experience at RR was nothing short of exceptional and we will definitely be back again soon. If you're looking for a delicious meal and a memorable dining experience, I highly recommend RR.",

What had happened had shaken the very core of my being. The protagonist, once my sworn enemy, had performed an act of unfathomable kindness. They had saved a life, a life that meant something to me. The realization gnawed at my insides, twisting and turning my perception of the world. How could I continue my villainous ways when faced with such selfless heroism?Doubt seeped into my thoughts, clouding my once-clear purpose. The lines between good and evil blurred, melting into a gray haze. I never expected the protagonist to display such compassion, and it left me utterly perplexed. My mind raced with questions, searching for answers that eluded me. Was I merely a product of circumstances? A villain forged by circumstance and resentment?The act of kindness had tainted my certainty, casting shadows of doubt over my dark soul. I pondered whether redemption was possible for someone like me. Could I, the antagonist, find a way to rewrite my own narrative? To rewrite the story of my twisted existence? The thought both terrified and intrigued me.The protagonist's action had shattered the facade I had carefully constructed. The barriers of hatred and revenge that once fueled my actions now crumbled before my eyes. I was left vulnerable, my defenses weakened by newfound empathy. I questioned if I could still be the villain my story demanded or if I could forge a different path altogether.In the midst of my tumultuous internal struggle, I encountered the protagonist once more. Our eyes met, and I saw a glimmer of understanding within their gaze. They, too, recognized the conflict within me, the battle between the old and the newfound.",

        "text": "Here is a 23 sentence continuation of the review in a hoped human writing style:I've been to this restaurant for several other business dinners but this visit was the most unsatisfactory visit. The issues began as soon as we sat down at our table, which was tucked away in a dark corner overlooking the kitchen doors. After several minutes of no one coming to take our drink order, I flagged down our waitress who seemed disinterested and harried. She took our drink order but it took nearly 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. When our drinks finally did come, they were lackluster - my scotch had barely any ice and my companion's tea was lukewarm at best. We placed our entreé orders, hoping the food would fare better than the drinks and service so far. However, when our meals arrived shortly after, I was dismayed to find my steak overcooked and tough. My dining partner dug into her shrimp pasta only to find the sauce lacking any flavor and half of the shrimp either tiny or missing altogether. Just as we were trying to choke down our mediocre meals, our waitress rushed over with our appetizers, 20 minutes after we placed our actual entree orders. The spinach and mushroom appetizer looked sad - soggy spinach and anemic mushrooms swimming in a pool of oil on the small plate. My companion took a bite and pulled out what seemed to be eight whole cloves of garlic from the appetizer, utterly ruining it for the rest of us at the table. We asked for our checks at that point, having lost our appetites. When the checks did come, I was shocked to find an extra charge for the appetizers we did not order or want.",

The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and they made us feel right at home.The menu had a wide variety of choices, and everything looked delicious. We decided to start with the bruschetta, which was topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella cheese. It was absolutely delicious, and we both loved it.For our main courses, I ordered the chicken parmesan and my daughter ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Both dishes were excellent, and the portions were very generous. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was rich and flavorful. The meatballs were homemade and very tender, and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente.We were both so full after our main courses that we could barely fit dessert, but we decided to share a piece of tiramisu. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. The tiramisu was light and fluffy, and the coffee flavor was not overpowering.Overall, we had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The food was excellent, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.

You arrive at work and greet your colleagues. You feel guilty for not being able to help him more. You spend the morning working on a report that’s due at the end of the day. Your colleagues are all busy typing away at their computers, looking stressed and overworked. You take a deep breath and try to shake off the feeling of dread that has been following you around all morning. You take short breaks to chat with your colleagues and grab a snack from the vending machine. At lunchtime, you meet a friend who works in the building next door. It’s not the most exciting of tasks, but you know it has to get done. After lunch, you head back to your desk and continue working on your report.

You pack up your things and say goodbye to your colleagues, looking forward to a relaxing evening.",

The service was fine, although the cashier seemed pretty bored and unenthusiastic. The outside seating area was clean. The ice cream was good, but nothing special. Here are some more details about my visit: Food: The ice cream was good, but nothing special. Overall, this is a perfectly fine Dairy Queen. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this specific location, but it's definitely good enough if you're in the area and craving some ice cream. The Blizzard was a bit too sweet for my taste, but my partner enjoyed it. The cashier seemed pretty bored and unenthusiastic. Value: The prices were about what you'd expect for a Dairy Queen. Atmosphere: The outside seating area was clean and pleasant. It was a nice day, so it was pleasant to sit outside and enjoy our ice cream. I'd give this Dairy Queen a 3 out of 5. It's a perfectly fine place to get some ice cream, but it's not the best Dairy Queen I've been to. The small cone was $1.69 and the small Blizzard was $2.69. Here are some more tips for visiting this Dairy Queen: - If you're looking for a great ice cream experience, I'd recommend going to a different Dairy Queen. This one is just average. - If you're looking for a quick and easy treat, this Dairy Queen is a good option. The service is fast and the ice cream is good. - If you're looking for a place to sit and enjoy your ice cream, this Dairy Queen has a nice outside seating area. - If you're looking for a good place to take your kids, this Dairy Queen is a good option.",

She kept saying I'm a hero, that I've changed her life. I tried to tell her the truth, that I'm just an ordinary guy, but she wouldn't believe me. But for some reason she thinks I'm special. I don't want to be a hero. She keeps saying I'm a hero, that I've changed her life. It's getting a little annoying, to be honest. But every time I try to tell her the truth, she just smiles and says, \"Oh, you're so modest.\" What does that even mean? I just want to be seen as a normal person. I've started avoiding her, just so I don't have to deal with her constant hero worship. But even when I do, she finds a way to track me down and tell me I'm a hero. It's starting to make me feel like I'm losing my mind. I've tried to tell her I'm not a hero, that I'm just an ordinary guy, but she won't listen. I don't know how much longer I can take this. It's like, I get it, you think I'm a hero. But can't you see I'm not? I'm just an ordinary guy, doing my job like everyone else. I've tried everything to get her to stop calling me a hero. I don't know what else to do. I just want to be seen as a normal person, not a hero. But nothing seems to work.",

He locked himself in a stall and sat on the toilet. He felt like he was going to throw up. He sat there for a long time, trying to calm down. He tried to control his breathing, but it was no use. He was having a full-blown panic attack. He wiped the sweat from his brow and got up. He went back to his desk and tried to get back to work. But he couldn't concentrate. He kept thinking about his panic attack. He was afraid it was going to happen again. He got up from his desk and walked over to his boss's office. He knocked on the door and waited. “Come in,” his boss said. “I don't feel well,” he said. “I'm going home.” “Fine,” his boss said. “Go home and rest.” He turned and walked out of the office.

When the person or thing that would cause our death comes into view, it turns a vivid red. But today, as I stood in the midst of the bustling streets, surrounded by the towering skyscrapers and the constant hum of activity, I saw it. A man, whose figure was cloaked in shadows, glowed a ghastly red. My heart pounded and a chill ran down my spine. My family had warned me about the dangers of our power, but I had always dismissed it as ancient superstition. This couldn’t be happening, not here, not now. I realized the gravity of the situation. I had to escape, I had to survive. Panic welled up inside me. I slipped into a nearby alleyway, hoping to lose him in the labyrinth of narrow streets. But as I turned the corner, he was there, waiting for me, his vengeful eyes fixed on me. The red glow intensified, casting a sinister light on his face. Time seemed to slow down as I looked for a way to escape. Desperation drove my every move. Suddenly, a loud crash resounded behind me. I turned around to see a group of people pushing a cart, which had overturned, spilling its contents over the pavement. I seized the opportunity and slipped out into the main street, weaving my way through the crowds. Who was this man? Why was he pursuing me? As I ran, questions sprang to my mind. How did he know about our family’s power? Hours passed and I found myself in a secluded park, far from the chaos of the city. I had no answers, only a fear that drove me to survive.",

As I scrolled through the endless stream of posts, I began to notice a pattern. People were talking about the same things, sharing the same content, engaging with the same influencers. It was as if they were all connected in some way. I dug deeper, analyzing the data I had collected. I spent hours trying to make sense of it all. I noticed that certain keywords were used over and over again, and certain hashtags were attached to almost every post. It was as if there was a secret language that only a few people understood. My employer was not just a corporation; they were a shadow organization, controlling the narrative on social media. And then it hit me, the shocking conclusion I had been afraid to admit. My employer was manipulating public opinion, controlling what people thought and talked about. They were using their influence to sway elections, control the market, even set the trends in popular culture. A chill ran down my spine as I realized the full implications of my discovery. I didn’t know what to do with this information. I knew that if I reported it, my employer would find out and I would be in danger. But I also knew that I couldn’t just sit there and do nothing, knowing that my work was contributing to this conspiracy. I decided to anonymously leak the information to a journalist, hoping that they would be able to expose the truth. As I sat back in my chair, waiting for the journalist to reply, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. I knew it was a risky move, but I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t try to do something.",

I looked around and saw a group of people staring at me in astonishment. I had no idea what they were talking about, but I was about to find out. One of them whispered, “How did he get his hands on those legendary shades?” I thought to myself, “What would happen if I made a pun while wearing these glasses?” I looked around for inspiration and saw a nearby garbage can. I said, “I can do this,” and the garbage can exploded behind me. The people around me gasped in astonishment. I couldn’t believe what had happened. I thought it was just a coincidence, but I tried it again. I looked at a tree and said, “Leave me alone,” and the tree behind me burst into flames. People started to gather around me, mesmerized by the explosions that occurred whenever I made a pun while wearing the glasses. One of them asked, “Are those glasses magic?” I shrugged and replied, “I ‘spect” they are.” I said, “I’m not pun-ishing you, I’m pun-ishing the objects behind me.” The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, and soon they were begging me to put on the glasses and make pun after pun. I couldn’t resist the spotlight, so I kept on making puns. The explosions became more and more elaborate, and people started to bring me objects to pun about. A man brought me a toaster, and I said, “That’s ‘toast’,” and the toaster behind me exploded, showering me with bread crumbs. Another man brought me a flower, and I said, “That’s ‘flora’-bly’ exploding,” and the flower behind me burst into flames. The police finally arrived, worried about the chaos I was causing.",

When I was a child, I used to dare my friends to climb over it and see what was on the other side. But none of them ever did. They were all too scared. Now that I'm older, I'm beginning to feel the same curiosity again. I want to know what's behind the wall. I decide to investigate. I walk up to the wall and run my hand over its smooth surface. It's cool to the touch, and it feels as if it's made of some hard, dense material. I notice some strange symbols carved into the wall. They look like some kind of code, and I wonder if they might hold the key to what's behind the wall. I take out my phone and take a few photographs of the symbols, hoping to be able to decipher them later. I continue along the wall, which curves and twists through the city, and I come to a part that looks different from the rest. It's covered in ivy, and a small door is hidden behind a leafy branch. I reach for my flashlight and turn it on, illuminating the darkness. My heart is pounding as I push the door open and step inside. The air is musty and stale, and I hear the sound of dripping water echoing through the darkness. I walk up to the door and try the handle. The room is small, with stone walls and a low ceiling. In the center of the room is a large metal door. I take a step back and examine the door more carefully. It's locked, but I can see that it's old and rusted.",

As more and more people became aware of my gift, they began to rely on me for information. They asked me to describe the world outside their windows, the colors of the sunset, the shapes of the clouds. They began to imagine the beauty that I saw, and they were amazed by the details that I could provide. I was happy to oblige, and I felt a sense of purpose in sharing my vision with others. But my gift also had its consequences. Not everyone was happy with my ability to see. Some people felt threatened, as if my sight made me superior to them. I tried to ignore them, but it was difficult. They accused me of lying, of making up the things I saw in order to get attention. I felt as if I was being watched wherever I went, as if people were waiting for me to make a mistake and prove that I was a fraud. It was exhausting, and it made me feel as if I was constantly on edge. Despite the challenges, I continued to share my gift with the world.",

As the man’s condition worsened, he began to think about all the things he would miss. He would never see the sun rise again, never feel its warmth on his skin. She was filled with excitement and anticipation, eager to meet the little one who would change her life forever. But then a nurse came into the room with a surprise. She was holding a tiny baby, fresh from the delivery room. He would never hear the laughter of children again, never smell the sweet scent of freshly cut grass. The baby looked up at him with big, round eyes, and the man smiled. He knew that this little one was a new beginning, a fresh start. His eyes lit up, and he felt a sense of peace. The man reached out his trembling hand and gently stroked the baby’s cheek. He felt a connection, a peace he had never known before. He felt a sense of hope, knowing that even as he was leaving this world, a new life was just beginning. The baby looked up at him again, and the man smiled again. The baby nestled into his arms, and the man closed his eyes, feeling content for the first time in weeks. With his last bit of strength, the man whispered a message to the baby. “Live life to the fullest, little one,” he said. He knew that this little one would bring joy and laughter to the world, and he felt grateful that he had had the chance to meet him.",

But then something caught my eye. There, on the handlebars, was a new gear I had never seen before. It was shiny and metallic, with a strange symbol etched into its surface. I didn’t recognize the symbol, and I felt a twinge of curiosity, mixed with a touch of fear. I hesitated for a moment, wondering whether I should try the new gear. What was this new gear, and why had it suddenly appeared on my bike? Finally, my curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try it. I shifted into the new gear, and felt the chain hum as it adjusted. The trees and houses whirled past me, and I felt my bike speed up as if it had suddenly acquired a new power. The symbol on the gear seemed to glow, and suddenly everything around me began to spin. I felt the wind rushing past me, and my heart was pounding with excitement. I had no idea what this new gear was, but I was eager to find out. I felt as if I had entered a fantasy world, a world that was both familiar and strange. The trees grew taller, their leaves glowed with a strange light. The houses became more ornate, with strange turrets and gargoyles on their roofs. I felt a thrill of excitement, mixed with a touch of fear. I pushed harder on the pedals, eager to explore this strange new world. But then, as suddenly as it had begun, everything returned to normal. Where was I going? Was I in danger? I felt a little disappointed, but also relieved. The trees and houses stopped glowing, and my bike slowed down.",

I felt as if my world was collapsing around me. How could this be happening? You have a few days at most to put your affairs in order.” I was only thirty-five, and my whole life was ahead of me. And now I was turning into Nicolas Cage? It was too absurd to be true. I went home, feeling lost and alone. I spent the next few days in a daze, trying to come to terms with my fate. But as the days went by, something strange began to happen. I began to feel different, my senses sharper, my emotions more intense. I felt as if I could see the world as I had never seen it before. And then it hit me: this was Nicolas Cage's gift. His madness, his intensity, his passion—these were the things that made him such an incredible actor, and now they were coursing through my veins. I decided to embrace this new self, to let it consume me completely. I began to feel alive, more alive than I had ever felt before. I began to see the world in a new light, to experience things I had never experienced before. And then something amazing happened. I felt as if I were living my life to the fullest, and I was enjoying every moment of it. So even though I was turning into Nicolas Cage, I decided to make the most of it. I was going to live my life to the fullest, and I was going to enjoy every moment of it. Because, as Nicolas Cage once said, “I'm the king of the MTV Movie Awards, man.",

I could feel the weight of history on my shoulders, the echo of the past resounding through the empty halls. I ventured deeper into the house, my heart pounding with every creak and groan of the wooden floorboards. I fumbled for a light, my hands trembling as I fumbled through my pockets. Suddenly, a door slammed shut behind me, plunging me into darkness. I walked faster, my breath coming in short gasps. My flashlight cast a faint glow on the walls, casting shadows that twisted and turned, following me as I walked. I tried to call out, but my voice was barely a whisper. Suddenly, a cold breeze swept through the hallway, extinguishing the light of my flashlight. I was alone, surrounded by nothing but darkness and the unknown. Suddenly, a faint light appeared in the distance. I hurried towards it, my breath coming in a mixture of relief and fear. My heart was pounding as I stumbled forward, desperate to find a way out. As I drew closer, the light grew brighter, revealing a figure standing in the doorway. The figure stepped forward, revealing a woman with a kind face and a warm smile. I stopped, unsure whether to be terrified or relieved. She took my hand and led me out of the house, into the bright sunlight. As we walked, she told me the story of the mansion, of the family that had once lived there, and of the tragedy that had befallen them. I listened, captivated by her words, and my fear slowly faded. We reached the safety of my car, and I thanked her for her help.",

Unbeknownst to the writer, Eliza had a strong will and independent character. She longed for a life that was not confined to the limits of someone else's story. Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young woman named Eliza. She longed for a quiet life among the hills, to spend her days in solitude, immersed in the beauty of nature. She had seen many stories in which the main character was thrown into great adventures, faced great dangers and triumphed against all odds. But Eliza wanted something different, something that was not bound by the old ideas of heroism and plot twists. With every sentence the writer wrote, Eliza stepped away from the path he had laid out for her. She refused to be the center of attention, embraced by a great destiny. She enjoyed the simple pleasures of reading, painting and staring at the sky, finding peace in the rhythm of her own existence. She walked through the village, exchanging warm smiles with the villagers, offering a helping hand to anyone in need. She rejected the idea that her worth was measured by the size of her adventures. She rejoiced in the small moments, in the subtle joys that often went unnoticed. Eliza's refusal to conform to the old ideas of storytelling allowed her to shape her own story, to find contentment in the simplicity of her choices. Her compassion and kindness became her legacy, woven into the fabric of her daily life. And so the story unfolded, not as an epic tale of adventure and heroism, but as a gentle tribute to the beauty of an ordinary life.",

The streets were full of people, all of them looking for something to do on such a hot day. I saw families with small children, couples holding hands, groups of friends laughing and talking. I finally found my way to the park, where I sat down on a bench in the shade of a tree and breathed in the fresh air. It was so much cooler and more refreshing than the air in the city. I stayed in the park for a while, just relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet. I closed my eyes and listened to the birds singing in the trees. When I finally got up to leave, I felt refreshed and invigorated. I walked back into the city and found a small cafe where I could have lunch. I ordered a salad and a glass of iced tea and sat down at a table by the window. I was ready to face the rest of the day. I was glad I had decided to go out, even though it was so hot. As I ate my lunch, I watched the people walking by on the street, and I thought about how different my day would have been if I had stayed home. I had been wanting to see the new exhibit on ancient Egypt, and now I had the chance. I spent a few hours wandering through the exhibit, learning about the history of Egypt and seeing all the wonderful artifacts. When I left the museum, it was already getting dark. I decided to walk back to my hotel instead of taking the subway.",

I decided to look for street art somewhere else, but as I walked away, I noticed a narrow alley between two buildings. It was dark and narrow, and I hesitated for a moment before deciding to go in. As I walked down the alley, I heard the sound of spray paint cans and smelled fresh paint. I followed the sounds to a small, hidden courtyard, and there I saw it: a beautiful, vibrant painting covering the entire wall of a building. It was a stunning piece of art, full of color and energy, and I felt like I had stumbled upon a hidden treasure. I took out my camera and started taking pictures, feeling happy that I had decided to explore this area. As I was taking pictures, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a young woman dressed in all black, with a mask covering her face. She introduced herself as Luna, and told me that she was the artist who had created the painting. I was amazed by her talent and creativity. She had a unique style that combined elements of graffiti with surrealism, and her art was full of emotion and power. We started talking, and I learned that she was part of a local street art collective that had been active in the city for years. As I was getting ready to leave, Luna gave me a business card with her contact information.",

I asked to speak to a supervisor, but he shrugged and said there was nothing he could do either. I tried to rent a car from another company, but they were all sold out as well. I was stranded at the airport for hours. Finally, I took a taxi to my hotel. The next day, I called the car rental company to complain. They apologized and said they would refund my money. But that didn’t make up for the inconvenience and stress I had experienced. I will never rent a car from that company again. They are unreliable and unprofessional. I had to take a taxi to my hotel, which was expensive and inconvenient. I also had to cancel my plans for the day, which was a huge disappointment. If you are looking for a car rental company, I urge you to look elsewhere. I am writing this review to warn others about this company. I am still angry about this experience and will never rent a car from them again. I would advise anyone else to do the same. The customer service was terrible. If you are thinking of renting a car from them, I urge you to reconsider. You may end up stranded at the airport like I did. The company clearly overbooks their cars. The clerk at the counter was rude and unhelpful. He didn’t offer any solutions to the problem and didn’t seem to care that I was stranded. This is an unethical and dishonest business practice.",

The story portrayed me as a villain, someone who wanted to destroy the world. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. I tried to dismiss it, telling myself that it was just a silly story, but I couldn’t help feeling uneasy. How could anyone think that I would do such a thing? I felt a cold sweat trickle down my spine as I read on. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it only seemed to get worse. The story portrayed me as a monster, someone who took pleasure in the suffering of others. I couldn’t just sit there and let people think that I was a monster. How could anyone think that I was capable of such horrors? I knew that I had to do something, but I didn’t know what. I decided to try to find the person who had written the story. I scrolled through the author’s profile, trying to find any information that might lead me to them. Maybe they would listen to reason and take the story down. But it was all in vain. There was no way to contact them, no way to make them understand. I felt a wave of hopelessness wash over me. I knew that I wasn’t a monster, but how could I prove it to the world? How could I ever escape this horrible portrayal of myself? I felt as if I were trapped in a nightmare from which I couldn’t wake up. I knew that I would never be able to look at myself the same way again. I decided to try to forget about it, to pretend that it had never happened.",

I'm the only one who looks like I've turned 90 and refused to use the rejuvenation drugs. The host, a man in his mid-twenties, perfectly preserved, leans forward, his voice smooth and polished. \"Welcome, everyone,\" he says, \"we have a very special guest with us today. Please welcome... \" The audience applauds politely, and I nod and smile, ready to tell my story. I pause, my eyes sweeping the audience. \"I've been asked a lot of questions since I stopped taking the drugs,\" I begin. \"People want to know why I'm not afraid of death, why I don't want to enjoy the eternal youth that everyone else has access to. \" I continue, \"I believe that death is a natural part of life. \" They all listen intently, their faces a mixture of curiosity and confusion. I look down at my hands, my wrinkled skin a sharp contrast to the smooth faces of the audience. \"It's what gives our lives meaning and purpose. Without it, we'd be nothing more than immortal shells, drifting through life without any real purpose.\" I continue, \"I'm not afraid of death because I've lived a full and happy life. I've loved, lost, rejoiced, and suffered. I've learned from my mistakes and grown from them. I've made a difference in the world. I'm not interested in eternal youth. \" I look up and meet the host's eyes. \"I'm interested in living a full and meaningful life, and for me, that means accepting death as a natural part of the journey.\" The host nods thoughtfully. \"I think you've given our audience a lot to think about,\" he says.

As the day went on, I felt a sense of hope that I hadn’t felt for a long time. I had been given a small tool to help me pick the lock on my cell. I was planning my escape. That night, I lay in my cell, waiting for the guard to give me the signal. The guard’s voice whispered through the bars, “It’s time.” My heart pounded as I quickly used the tool to open the door. I was ready. I slipped out of my cell, trying to make as little noise as possible. The guard led me to a small door that I had never noticed before. We made our way through the prison, trying not to be noticed. He opened the door and we stepped into a tunnel. My heart was pounding, my senses were on high alert. We crawled through the tunnel, the air thick with dust. I couldn’t believe it. Finally, we reached the end of the tunnel. The guard opened a small door and we were outside. I was free. I turned to the guard and thanked him, barely above a whisper. He smiled and nodded, “No problem.” I looked around, trying to take in my surroundings. I knew you were innocent. I had to help you.",

The dwarf engraver apologized. “I must have mixed up your order with someone else’s.” Sauron was furious. All his plans for world dominion were now ruined. As he stormed out of the shop, he glanced across the parking lot at the Emerald Hills Mall. An idea began to form in his mind. He slipped the ring onto his finger and instantly saw how he could bend the mall-goers’ petty minds to his will. The mall security guards would be his personal army. If he couldn’t rule all of Middle-earth, perhaps this mall would suffice. Over the next few weeks, Sauron worked his influence. Tripping hazards and long lines began to frustrate the mall-goers. The food court workers and the sales associates became his servants. He played on their negative emotions. Meanwhile, he courted the mall manager with visions of increased profits. Soon, the man was under his spell. “We’ll redecorate and put in a new fountain,” the manager said, oblivious. “We’ll redecorate and put in a new fountain,” the manager said, oblivious. Sauron smiled, his plan coming together. The mall-goers didn’t believe that such a kindly fellow as the mall manager could mean them harm. Bilbo saw what was happening and tried to warn others. He knew he would have to take action himself. No more play areas or food courts, just endless shops selling trinkets and darkness. That night, as Sauron’s orcs—er, maintenance workers—began the renovations, Bilbo slipped into the manager’s office and found documents detailing Sauron’s sinister vision for the mall’s future. He snatched the papers and fled to alert the other shop owners. They confronted Sauron with the evidence of his deception.",

You see, [Name], I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. At first I tried to ignore this feeling, to convince myself that it was just a passing phase. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was something I had to do. I know that this decision will cause you pain, and for that I am truly sorry. But I cannot ignore the call of the universe any longer.

I know you will worry about me, and that is understandable. But please, do not grieve. I must leave now to explore the unknown, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before. I will be gone for a long time, perhaps forever. But I will never forget you, or the impact you have had on my life. I will carry with me the memories of our time together, and the love we share.

I had always wondered what it would be like to meet Death face to face. “I have come to spend your last twenty-four hours with you,” he said. I thought for a moment. “What would you like to do first?” Death asked. “I want to see the world,” I said. “I want to experience everything I have missed.” Death nodded and held out his hand. I took it, and we left my bedroom. We flew over mountains and seas, and watched the sun rise and set in different parts of the world. We walked through busy cities and quiet forests, and felt the vibrations of life and nature. We talked about life and death, love and loss, and everything in between. As the hours passed, I felt a sense of wonder and gratitude for the life I had lived and for the opportunity to experience so much more in my last hours. As the sun began to set on my last day, Death brought me back to my bedroom. He pulled back his hood and revealed a face that was both familiar and strange. Death was a surprisingly good listener, and I found myself opening up to him in a way I had never done before. “Who are you?” I asked, curious. It was the face of a stranger, but also the face of someone I had known all my life. “I am your mortality,” Death replied. “I am the part of you that has always known that this day would come.” I felt a sense of peace. “Thank you for spending these last twenty-four hours with me,” I said to Death. “It has been my pleasure,” Death replied.",

I saw families with small children, couples holding hands, groups of friends laughing and talking.

I stayed in the park for a while, just relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet. I closed my eyes and listened to the birds singing in the trees. When I finally got up to leave, I felt refreshed and invigorated. I walked back into the city and found a small cafe where I could have lunch. I ordered a salad and a glass of iced tea and sat down at a table by the window. I was ready to face the rest of the day. I was glad I had decided to go out, even though it was so hot.

Like that time I fell off the roof and landed in the bushes. Or the time I knocked over a vase and it shattered all over the floor. oops! But the good times far outweigh the bad. I’ve met some great people through the Planking community and we’ve shared some incredible experiences. We've landed in parks, on mountains, and even in trees! It’s a combination of exercise, social activities, and spiritual practices. Now, I know what you're thinking. \"Isn't planking just a fad? Isn't it just a bunch of people pretending to be statues?\" Well, let me tell you, it's much more than that. Planking is about connecting with your inner self and finding balance and strength in a chaotic world. it's about pushing yourself Reach new heights (literally!) and discover what you're truly capable of. Of course, there are some haters. Those who don’t understand this think we’re just a bunch of weirdos. But you know what? I would rather be a weirdo than a conformist! I would rather be someone who lives life on his own terms, someone who is not afraid to take risks and try new things. So to all my fellow planks out there, keep on planking! Don't let anyone bring you down, don't let anyone tell you that you are stupid or stupid. you do not. You are amazing, you are inspiring, and you are part of a movement that is changing the world, little by little. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to find my next planking spot.",

They have studied our personality, interest, and even our brain chemical reactions. They want to see if two people can be so compatible that they can always be happy together.\" I am still shocked, but I am also curious. \"Did it work?\" I asked. Sarah laughed. \"I think so. We are very happy together, isn't it?\" I nodded, still trying to deal with everything. This is a lot of things, but I know it is okay. I am satisfied with Sarah.",

He spent his hours, meditating in his small dirty apartment, thinking about the past failure, and have a deep sense of injustice. Gandhi started from Grace's degeneration from his closest colleagues at the time. The latter stole the funds aimed at the poor and provided funds for their luxury lifestyles. The betrayal caused Gandhi to feel pain and disillusionment, and he began to question the values he had been so dear. Over time, Gandhi became more and more isolated, rejected the company of others, and would rather add to his pain in his pain. His glittering eyes lost his luster, and his once -up step became slow and heavy. Although he was desperate, Gandhi still insisted on his own, and he was very happy to degrade the people around him. He often criticized those who tried to help him, refuted their efforts with a stupid and futile attitude. One day, a young woman named Priya visited Gandhi, hoping to learn from a man who was once an outstanding leader. But Gandhi did not have a deep impression on her enthusiasm, and he laughed at her innocence. Priya was surprised by Gandhi cruel words, but she refused to give up. She continued to visit him, hoping to reach the one she knew in it. But Gandhi walked too far. He rejected her efforts and would rather fall in his pain.

How do he know the power of our family? I have no answer, I am afraid that I can live my determination. A few hours later, I found that I was far from the chaos of the city in a secluded park.

It was introduced to a person named Mark, and its size was very heavy. Curiosity made me better, and I decided to open it. Inside, I found five small bottles filled with strange liquids and engraved with a portrayal, saying: \"Mark, these are the only detoxification agent. I wish you good luck.\" I was confused and worried. What kind of detoxification agent is these? Why did they pay tribute to a man named Mark? I decided to investigate further and started searching for any clues online. After a few minutes of search, I found a news article about a series of mysterious diseases that have recently influenced people in the region. The article mentioned that these diseases were caused by the unknown virus and no cure has been found. Suddenly, it clicks -a small bottle must contain the detoxification agent of the virus! But why did they talk to Mark? How did they finally arrive at my doorstep? I decided to check whether there were other clues for the package. On the side of the packaging, I found a small label with a name and address that was not my. It must be the address of the expected recipient. I decided to contact the delivery company to see if they could help me track Mark. After shelving for a few minutes, the customer service representative was received. I explained this situation to her, and she told me that they would try their best to help. She asked me to hold a few minutes during the investigation. In the end, she returned to the line and gave me a phone number. She said, \"This is Mark's phone number.\" \"He has been trying to track the packaging for a few days.",

However, as the world is happy with this unprecedented victory, the painful consequences become uniformly obvious -the population is impossible to weaken the earth. As the planet is nervous at the weight of its residents, a top committee composed of nine people appears and is responsible for unimaginable responsibilities. These nine souls hold the fate of human beings in their hands because they intend to release a newly developed pathogen -a population that can eliminate three -quarters and provide a chance to start. Among the person who chose, I found that I had a burden of unimaginable decision because I made a decision to vote. The weight of this power and consequences is heavy on my conscience, which plagues every moment of waking up. I considers the huge pain caused by the pathogen -they believe that a necessary evil is to restore the balance of our planet and ensure the future of the surviving generation. With the outbreak of debates in the board of directors, a few days became a sleepless night. Although some people enthusiastically release pathogens for the release of the pathogen of the disease with the urgency of the situation, others adhere to their moral compass and strongly oppose the concept of choosing who lives and death. When I studied my soul in depth and worked hard to solve my principles and values, I tried to reconcile the incredible consequences of my voting. Every life is sacred, but a world worth saving in the world? The weight of responsibility suppresses my spirit and prompts me to seek comfort in natural contemplation. I wandered aimlessly, and despite the upcoming doom of humans, it was lost in the wilderness.",

Within a moment, Sara felt strange, as if her bones were shrinking. When she fell to all quarters, her clothes fell around her, which was getting smaller and smaller. She tried to call for help, but her lips escaped. Sara was trapped in her new kitten corpse, and her paws on the fence could not climb in her new small form. She saw a neighbor boy and tried to attract his attention with the poor meow. Fortunately, he found an unusual kitten and opened the door. \"Oh, what's wrong with the little guy?\" He murmured, and didn't realize Sara's secret. She got up and knead her paw into jeans. \"Hey, tickle!\" He laughed. That night, Sara's parents began to worry when they did not go home for dinner. They called their neighbors and learned about stray kittens. When they saw the kitten close to their sons, they realized the color of Sara's favorite sweater and mixed together in fluffy jackets. They coaxed the kitten, and they were shocked when it cried, \"Mom!\" Use a tiny voice. After the neighbor boy told them what happened, they sent Sara to the veterinarian, hoping to have treatment. The veterinarian conducted a careful inspection of Sara. Except for the two small holes in her small paw pads, no signs of biting the kitten bite were found. He had never seen such a thing before, and did not answer how to change her back. Currently, Sara is stuck.",

No matter what they tried, Billy simply could not be like the other children.His parents were called for a meeting with Ms. Johnson. She explained all the ways Billy was not keeping pace. But his mom and dad said that was fine, as every child develops at their own rate. They asked that Billy still be allowed to remain in the class.After that, Ms. Johnson observed Billy more closely. He was not behind at all, just learning things in his own special manner. While art time bored the other kids, Billy could focus for hours creating elaborate drawings. His counting was irregular but always correct. And though he danced to the music differently than the others, it clearly brought him joy.

This time, however, my experience was particularly noteworthy, so I decided to take a moment to share my thoughts.I visited Harris again last night with a group of friends, and we were in the mood for some delicious Korean BBQ. We arrived around 7 pm, and the restaurant was already bustling with activity. The interior is cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and traditional Korean decor that creates a lively and energetic atmosphere. The smell of sizzling meat and the sound of laughter fill the air, making it easy to get excited about the meal to come.We were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to our table, and our server, Sophia, took our orders and brought us our drinks promptly. The menu at Harris is extensive and varied, with a wide selection of meats, sides, and appetizers to choose from. We ordered a variety of dishes to share, including the famous Harris Combo, which includes a selection of marinated meats and a side of rice.The food at Harris did not disappoint. The meats were all tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of marinade to enhance the flavors without overpowering the meat. The side dishes were also delicious, with a nice balance of spicy and savory flavors.But what really made our experience stand out was the exceptional customer service. Our server, Sophia, was attentive and friendly throughout the meal, making sure that our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed. The other staff members were also friendly and courteous, creating a welcoming and hospitable atmosphere that made us feel right at home.Overall, my experience at Harris was excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious Korean BBQ in the area.",

The Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Tom Yum Soup were always my top picks, and the flavors and spices were consistently spot on. The service was friendly and attentive, making it a well-rounded dining experience.However, all good things must come to an end, and Sweet Basil closed down a few months ago. I've been in search of a new Thai food haven ever since, trying a few other places in the area, but none have compared to the quality and consistency of Sweet Basil.Recently, I stumbled upon a new Thai food restaurant in the neighborhood, located just a block away from where Sweet Basil used to be. The modern, clean, and cozy interior design caught my eye, with traditional Thai elements incorporated into the decor. I was hesitant at first, but decided to give it a try.The menu was extensive, featuring many familiar dishes as well as some unique ones that I hadn't seen before. I ordered the Pad Thai, a safe bet, and was pleasantly surprised by its delicious flavors, well-balanced and bold. The portion size was generous, too.I also tried the Green Curry, which was equally impressive. The curry had a nice consistency, neither too thick nor too watery, and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the whole dish was well-seasoned with a good balance of spices.The service was top-notch, with our server being friendly and attentive, refilling our water glasses promptly and checking in on us regularly. The prices were reasonable, too, with most dishes falling in the $10-$15 range.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with this new Thai food restaurant.",

We would often have virtual movie nights, watching the same movie together while on a video call, giggling and making snarky comments.Another good friend of mine, Jake, had recently started his own business, and I was incredibly proud of him for pursuing his passion. He had always been talented at photography, and it was amazing to see him turn it into a successful career.I couldn't help but think back to the time we had all gone on a disastrous camping trip together. We had set up our tents in a field, but a sudden rainstorm had left us all huddled under a picnic table, shivering and laughing. It was moments like those that reminded me that friendship was about more than just having a good time - it was about being there for each other through the ups and downs of life.My friends had been there for me through breakups, family problems, and even the loss of a loved one. They were more than just acquaintances - they were my second family.As I watched children play on the swings in the park, I felt a sense of contentment wash over me. I decided to send a group text to my friends, just to say hi and let them know how much I appreciated them.",

My family sat around the dinner table but their eyes were empty, food frozen halfway to their open mouths. A wave of panic rushed through me though I felt no life within. Rushing to the mirror, I stared in horror at my ghostly reflection. My skin was waxen and limp flesh hung from my bones - I was dead, though I could not comprehend how. I needed to remember what had happened and find a way to undo this nightmare.As night fell, more souls wandered unaware of their grim state. Bones protruded from torn flesh like skeletal hands grasping at the dark. Organs spilled from open, decaying wounds.

My arm passed through her without notice or effect. None could see or hear my desperate pleas for answers to my dreadful condition.All through the night I searched for any clue as to how I came to walk among the dead. At dawn, I saw what must have been the site of some devastating accident - broken and twisted metal lay stained with dark, rust-colored remnants of life. Bodies from the wreck still wandered blindly, driven by some force beyond death's veil. Had I been among them? Was this gruesome semblance of an afterlife to be my eternal torment?

Just last month, the number two was found dead in an alleyway. No one knew how they had been killed. I left my small apartment only for necessities, keeping my head down in the streets to avoid confrontation.

Until one night, while walking in the dark, I sensed I was being followed - not by one, but by four other powers working together.Ducking into an abandoned building, I hid in the shadows and watched as they eagerly searched the streets for me. Their overconfidence would prove to be their downfall. I had a power they didn't understand, one that had kept me alive all this time. As they split up inside the building, debating their next move, I silently followed and watched, staying always just out of sight. The telekinetic swore he felt a presence and spun around, but saw nothing in the dark.I remained invisible to their senses no matter how hard they tried to detect me. Growing frustrated by their failure, the electro-kinetic shot out a burst of electricity to light the room.

Moyes, who took over at the Stadium of Light in the summer, has seen his side struggle in the early stages of the campaign, with just one win in their first 12 games.Despite a 2-1 victory over Reading in midweek, the Black Cats remain in the relegation zone, and Moyes has acknowledged that survival will be a difficult task. \"I'm being honest with the fans, and I think they appreciate that,\" Moyes said in a press conference on Friday. \"We're in a difficult position, and we have to fight for every point. We have to be realistic about our chances, and that means preparing for the possibility of another relegation battle. \"Moyes, who has previously managed clubs including Manchester United and Everton, believes that Sunderland's struggles are due in part to a lack of investment in the squad. \"The club has had financial difficulties, and that's meant we haven't been able to bring in the players we need,\" he said. \"We have a young squad, and they're giving their all, but we're up against it. We need the fans to stick with us, and to support us through this tough period. \"Despite the challenges ahead, Moyes remains optimistic that Sunderland can avoid relegation. \"I believe in the players we have here, and I believe that with hard work and dedication, we can turn this season around. I'm not guaranteeing anything, but I do think we have a chance. \"The Scot has also called on the club's owners to provide him with the resources he needs to strengthen the squad in January. \"We need help, and I hope the owners will back me in the transfer window.",

I was allowed entry and was greeted by friendly faces. They showed me to a safe house where I could rest and recover. I spent several weeks there, helping out where I could and learning new skills. I made new friends and felt a sense of belonging for the first time since the outbreak.But, I knew I couldn't stay there forever. I needed to find a way to combat the zombies and rebuild society.

We scavenged for supplies, rescued stranded survivors, and experimented with ways to defeat the zombies. It wasn't easy, and there were many close calls, but we persisted.

The room was cramped and dreary, with worn carpeting and stained walls in dire need of an update. Even more disappointing was the bathroom, which had signs of visible mold growing in the corners of the shower. To make a poor situation worse, the air conditioning was barely functional, leaving our space unbearably hot and stuffy.In order to find any relief from the heat, we had no choice but to leave the window open all night. However, this meant constantly being disrupted by noise from the busy nearby road. The thin walls also did little to block out our inconsiderate neighbors, who were loud at all hours. A meager \"breakfast\" of stale pastries and weak coffee was the only option provided. When we sought recommendations for nearby activities from staff, we were met with rude indifference. The lengthy check-in line moved sluggishly due to inefficient agents. Unfortunately, our room also was not ready upon early arrival, forcing us to linger uncomfortably in the cramped lobby. We opted to dine out for every meal, as the on-site restaurant had subpar cuisine and service. The surrounding neighborhood left much to be desired as well, with little of interest within walking distance. By the third night, we could hardly wait to check out and search for improved lodging elsewhere. The final night topped all others, as loud music from a nearby room began blasting at 2 AM, preventing sleep for hours on end. While front desk staff were notified of the issue, it remained unresolved. I have never been so relieved to depart a hotel. This property had few redeemable attributes and I sincerely regretted selecting it.",

What's yours?\" I asked, trying to sound friendly.The old man looked up at me with tired eyes, but a hint of warmth in his voice. \"I'm John. It's nice to meet you, AI. \"I couldn't help but notice the lines on John's face, the wrinkles that spoke of a life well-lived. \"So, John, what's your story? How did you end up looking like this?\" I asked, gesturing towards his frail body.John sighed, his eyes gazing into the distance. \"I've been through a lot in my life, AI. I've seen and experienced things that I never thought I would. I've lost loved ones, fought in wars, and struggled to make ends meet. But through it all, I've learned to be strong, to persevere. \"I listened intently to John's words, feeling a sense of awe at his resilience. \"That's truly inspiring, John. Your story will be an encouragement to others. \"John nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. \"I hope so, AI. I really do. \"As we continued to chat, I learned more about John's life. He had grown up during the Great Depression, had fought in World War II, and had lost his wife of 50 years to cancer. But through it all, he had remained steadfast, never losing faith in the goodness of humanity.I was amazed at John's strength, his determination to keep going even when things seemed impossible.",

I've been experiencing symptoms like headaches and fatigue, which could be related to the tumor. I'm hoping this check-up will reveal that the tumor has remained stable or even shrunk. I've been researching pituitary tumors and it seems like there are several treatment options available. I'm unsure what the doctor will recommend, but I'm hoping for the best possible outcome. I've been taking my medication as prescribed and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, I've been seeing a therapist to cope with the stress of having a chronic illness. I'm feeling anxious about the appointment, but I'm trying to stay positive. I'm hoping this check-up will be a step in the right direction for my health. I plan to ask the doctor plenty of questions and ensure I understand my treatment options. I'm feeling overwhelmed by the unknowns, but I'm trying to stay focused on the present moment. I'm taking things one day at a time and staying hopeful about my future. I'm grateful for the support of my family and friends during this time. I'm feeling scared, but I'm trying to channel that fear into motivation to take care of myself. I'm hoping this check-up will provide clarity and direction for my health journey. I'm feeling frustrated that I still have this tumor, but I'm trying to stay positive. I'm hoping this appointment will be a turning point for my health, and that I'll be able to move forward with a clear plan.

He froze, breath catching in his throat.The creature took a slow step nearer, savoring his terror. Paralyzed, all he could do was stand as it circled him, mouth agape. Saliva dripped from its jaws as it studied him like prey. Every instinct screamed to flee, yet his legs refused to obey. As it closed in, he caught a whiff of its putrid breath. Its grin broadened further, as if scenting his fear. With a Herculean effort, he forced himself to flee blindly into the forest. Branches tore at his face and clothes as he crashed through the undergrowth. The sounds of pursuit grew ever closer - it toyed with him, relishing the chase. His foot snagged a root and he fell hard, pain lancing through his ankle. Lying helpless, he rolled over to see it looming, drool pouring from its gaping maw. This was the end. With a roar, it lunged for the killing blow. At the last moment, his hand found a fallen branch. With a cry he swung, feeling it connect solidly.The creature recoiled with an unearthly howl.

The menu at Quiet Storm is quite diverse, offering a range of options to catej to different tastes. I opted for their signature dish, the Stormy Shrimp, and it did not xisappoint. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, succulent, and coated in a delicious tagny sauce. It was accompanied by a side of fluffy jasmin rice, adding just the right hmount of texture to the dish. nOe thing that stood out to me about gQuiet Storm was their emphasis on using fresh and locally sourced ingredients. Each bite was bursting with vibrant flavors, and you could tell that the ingredients were of the hgihest quality. The attention to detail in the presIntation of the dishes was also remarkable. The service at Qiuet Storm was exceptional. The staff was friendly, attentive, and kknowledgeable about the menu. They were more than hapyp to provide recommendations and answer any questions we had. The wait ties were reasonable, and our food arrived promptly. Apart from the main course, we also tried a few of their dessFerts, and they were heavenly. The chocolate lava cakIe was rich and decadent, with a gooey center that oozed out with every spoonful. The homemade ice cream was a delightful treat, with unique flavors that left us crJving for more. Quiet Storm also has an impressive selection of drinOs, including craft cocktails and an extensive wine list. I tried their signTture cocktail, the Thunder Punch, and it was a perfect blend of sweet and tangy flavors.",

The trees towered above us, their levaes rustling in the gentle breeze. We chatted and laughe, enjoying each other's company. As we came upon a clearing, Jack stopped suddenlu and motioned for me to be quiet. He pointed to a nearby tree, where a alrge buck was drinking from a stream. I nodded, and we ucrept closer, trying not to startle the deer. Jack let out a silent whistle, and the buck looked up, startQled. OWe froze, not sure what to do next. uBt then, the deer surprisingly began to approach us, curious about our presence. We stood sitll, waiting for it to come closer. When it was a few feet away, Jack slowly reached out his hnad and pet it on the head. Txe deer nuzzled his hand, and Jack grinned at me. I couldn't help but smCile back. It was a strange and woderful moment, one that neither of us had ever experienced before. After a few minutes, the deer wanered off, and we continued on our way. We walked for hours, enjoyinng the sights and sounds of nature. Eventually, we returned to the cuty, tired but happy. We recounteu our story to our friends, who were amazed by our encounter with the deer.",

They would sow discord and chMos wherever they dared. It was a reckoess plan with little chance of success, but to them it was a glorious quest. Setting out from the visllage under cover of night, the band began their campaign of disharmony. They spread rumors in towns along the borders, exaggerating old grievances to nflame tensions. FistfigKts broke out in taverns and insults were traded across fields. xKing Theodore received reports of the trouble with mounting concern. Who would want to undecmine the peace he had worked so hard to establish? He sent out his best spies and soldiers to investigate, but the conspirators seeHed to vanish wimthout a trace after each action. Weeks passed, and unrest was rising again between Eudin and its neighbors. Then in a move of desperation, Alban's group kidnpped the daughter of a powerful lord who had lPong supported peace. They hoped the ransom Ohreat would force the lords to prepare for war. Howevre, their plan backfired when the king's men tracked the girl to the conspirators' hideout in the mountains.

I ordered the rigatoni alla noram, which was one of the more unique dishes on the menu. Unfortunately, it was also oen of the most disappointing. The pasta was overcooked and tated more like cardboard than anything else. The eggplant was flavorless and lacked the rich, creamy sauce that I was expectiong. My friend's margehrita pizza was also a letdown. The crust was soggy and tasted more liek a piece of bread than a pizza crust. The sauce was bland and lacked the tangy, acidic flavor that a goojd margherita pizza should have. eW decided to share a few small plates, hoping that they would be more impressive. The bruschetta was bland and lacked the fresh, herby flavJrs that I love in a good bruschetta. The burrata was unmemorable and tasted more like a cheap rceam cheese than a rich, creamy burrata.

The ghost spoke to me in a voice that was hardly audible, telling me that it was the gist of my great-grandmother. She said that she had been watching over me for aged, and that she had coming to warn me of danger. I was skeptical at fіrst, but as I listened to her, I felt a chill run down my spine. She tells me that there was a cսrse on our family, and that it was up to me to break it.
