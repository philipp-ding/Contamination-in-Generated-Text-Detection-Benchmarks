Carla and Celia Hammond both came down and added support to the cause and helped bring the public attention to it after it had died down a bit following the initial furore when it was hijacked by anti-police protesters. Carla was doing some work against the live export trade from her house and I went there to help out. It was an amazing place with lots of animals a lot of whom were rescued. She was a very genuine person - not at all stuffy like some celebrities just very normal.An extraordinary talented, genuine, sensitive, inspirational  and compassionate lady who dedicated her life to giving pleasure and humour to her fellow man. History will also forever cherish her memory as a champion and voice for all animals, not only for those who needed a safe haven but for those thousands of animals who were forced on long hazardous journeys to the slaughterhouse, their pain was Carla's pain, their tears were Carla's tears. Although for only a brief period, It was a privilege to have worked with this exceptional legend.",

Even during the busiest laundry times (the weekends), you should be able to find a machine or two that are free. Some of the larger machines accept debit/credit cards. A word of caution: for the dryers, each time you add quarters or swipe to add extra time, you will need to press \"Start\" or else you will lose your money. The laundromat recently attached warning labels to each applicable machine. There are two television sets, so don't worry about missing that Penguins/Steelers/Pirates game, because there is a good chance those televisions are tuned in to those games. nnThere is an ATM machine next to the front desk in case you are short on quarters, and the employees will gladly break your $20 bills into smaller ones. There are change machines next to the ATM machine and along the window facing Ellsworth Avenue. I counted 5-6 folding stations, which means you might have to wait or share them during the busiest laundry times. nnOh, and feel free to bring your tablet or laptop because the facility has free WiFi, which is password-protected, but you can ask any employee for it. nnI didn't give the facility 5 stars because: 1, the place can get a little chaotic and very hard to navigate during its busy times, and 2, the overall cost can really add up, especially if you have lots of clothes (I don't know about what others think.. . perhaps I'm used to the super-cheap-economy pricing?",

It all changed when the mysterious general, simply known as Red, showed up. He employed strange tactics, dropping magcargo on bunkers, abandoning technology and using a psychic network of rare and ancient pokemon. Tides were turning all because of this seemingly immortal child. So we devised an end game. The trick was the gardevouirs. Capable of creating localized miniature black holes. A descendant of General Taichi Kamiya came up with the plan, we create servers in the digital world, cut it off from the real world at the same time we send teams of digidestined armed with black rings to take control of the gardevouirs. The teams knew it was suicide but once the gardevouirs were captured, the psychic network would be alerted and the digital world would be closed. Haste was prudent. Commander Kamiya challenged Red to a battle. A settlement; a distraction. The mightiest Digimon of the digital world against the poke gods. The battle raged on, Red' s capsulated horrors never died, they just lost consciousness, returning to him. Kamiya had overwhelming courage in the face of his greatest adversary however he was losing the battle. Halfway through the duel, operation dark storm commenced. As fast as it started it was over. The rings were released and the order was given. Black holes appeared all over the planet and tore it a sunder. In an instant it was all over. We live peacefully now in the digital world.",

Constraining the propertiesof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiativetransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiationfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-raybackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC andthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporatingbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausiblerange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input toradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Datafrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in theheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used toconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI columndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all theobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electrondensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, withsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; howeverC is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, andpartially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, andX(He^+) ~ 0.4.

Who honestly pays attention to the crippled or the deformed in this cruel world you have created? \" The creature seemed annoyed, but there was a reluctabt note of resignation in his tone which indicated that he had seen this moment coming. He had known that some day, his peaceful, idyllic retirement would be broken by some busy-body adventurers looking for fame and glory. So, what did they want? They had hunted him to the ends of the earth, and now, in this seedy tavern at the edge of civilisation, they had finally found him. \" So yes.... \" The creature growled, fixing his warped gaze on the heroes before him. \" I was a god, once... But that time is behind me. I do not play a part in the troubles and strife of men nor gods. Not now. \" \" But, \" said the youngest hero, his voice trembling. \"",

But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. nnI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime. It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. nnFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. nnBeware, they only accept cash.",

Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize. I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese. We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw. Luckily, it was great! nHere's the nitty gritty. The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread. They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting). It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary. The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle. The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better. At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar! Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven. Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse.. . ssshh!

As luck would have it, a table opened up near the bar, so we snagged it and decided to eat in the bar area. An extremely helpful waitress immediately took our drink and appetizer orders; we browsed the menu until she returned. nnWith drinks in hand and the appetizer (IPA hummus plate) underway, she regrettably informed us they had run out of cod. We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends). nnThe service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night. 5-stars for service. nnThe fish arrived and it was swimming in grease. Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting. The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting. nnI love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish. But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye. I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here.. .",

        "text": "We present a study of rotation (vsini) and chromospheric activity (Halpha EW)based on an extensive set of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with MIKEon the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope. Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the youngstellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning agesfrom 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistentwith pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromosphericemission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, wesee a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadilyfrom the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an ageindicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in thetotal sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr,possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disklifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation isflat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linearcorrelation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young starsgenerate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way frommain-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for asubset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for theEta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.Thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al. (1998) are in agreement with the observed radii within +-15%.",

It feels as though I am walking into a deep, dark cave, though the occasional glimpse of the moon proves that feeling wrong. The whispers are louder the deeper I trek in the forest, calling to me, urging me on. My mouth has gone dry, but I know there is no turning back now. To do so would only be worse than what I am enduring now. Ahead lies a clearing, with a simple pile of stones. The whispers have increased in frequency now, taunting me, describing my worst fears, my mistakes, my failures. All of these things are related, and located under this pile of stones. And every year these stones called to me. I stopped at the foot of the stones. Nothing in the clearing has changed from this time last year. I start to remove some of the rocks from the pile. Going deeper and deeper until a human skull is uncovered in the light of the moon. The whispers stopped and I hear a clear voice inside my head, as the jaw of the skull began to move.",

I ran past the old lady, destroyed from drugs. I ran straight into the, now five, men who stood at the only exit. The smell of gunpowder shot through the air, but they missed. Nothing could hit me, I was invincible. Or at least I thought I was until one, Apparently, the leader of this little troupe, shot me in the leg. I yelled in pain and had to stop my run, but I calmed down, re-modified my leg, and now was on the run again. A shield appeared in front of my face and I slammed straight into them. At once I was surrounded. I tried to change my appearance, but it did n' t matter, they knew who I was. \" We got one, \" The leader said into an undercover mic.

No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches. I will say that the food they do serve is good. I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering. nnD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar. Fine.

Pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria. nnThere was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area. There are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look! We all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice. The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet. nnI ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce. It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread. The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice. I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese. The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce. Nom! My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted. Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful. Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting! nnFor dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them. Everyone really enjoyed their meal. It just feels like a good place to spend your money. It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.",

Then one day, a mischievous girl came to my window and beckoned me away. She was beautiful, interesting, lovely. I was dreaming. I had to be. But no; this little, miniature woman flew high above me and taught me how to move through the air like she could. She pulled me along while we flew through London, soaring over the city. We would do this nightly, and every morning, exhausted, I would take myself to work. It was worth it, though, and I never said no. And one night, she gripped my finger, her tiny hands barely wrapping around it. She tugged to indicate I should follow her, and... I did. I never looked back. Neverland is truly a place where childhood dreams come true. I found a crew, and we sailed, fighting bad guys and finding treasure, with my little fairy on my shoulder. She always had a temper, though. It was part of her feisty personality, and I loved it... until she decided she was bored of our life. And then she flew off, and I never saw her again. Until a few years later. A few troublemakers had begun running about Neverland, harassing people and stealing treasure I' d buried. My crew and I decided to teach him a lesson- nothing bad, just tell him to knock it off. He was just a kid, after all. And as we approached him, I suddenly saw her, sitting on his shoulder.

Some want to run while others want to fly. Some want strength while others grace and beauty. I have never met anyone disappointed with their totem they recieved a gift that they will treasure their whole lives. Sometimes whole families run together as wolves, sometimes even the families of wolves have black sheep though. I must have been 10 when I first started thinking about my secret wish. The more time that passed the more certain my mind was made up. I will be the greatest who ever lived, never again will they laugh at this skinny little kid who just wanted to win something in his birthday. So here I am standing up high where everyone can see me. All eyes are looking at me, they never understood why I cared so much about this but finally I will be the champion I know it with every fiber of my being. I start forward and with a powerful leap I take to the air. Willing the change with all of my being. I let out a primal scream as I arc back towards the water below. I did it! I really did it! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The crowd was gathered in close and the wave spared no one as they looked on in shock and surprise.",

The espresso is very good, I stopped for an espresso and a croissant and there again was that inviting glass of \"fresh\" orange juice in front of me. I ask what kind of OJ is it, fresh squeezed or pasteurized? Tropicana IOWs. To me the big deal is that pasteurizing always changes the taste of the juice, even if it's \"flash pasteurized\"nnBoth young ladies behind the counter swear high and low that it's fresh squeezed and that's what they are instructed to tell customers. I buy it, taste it, inform them that it's indeed pasteurized, demand to see the bottle and promise to apologize profusely if I'm wrong. The cashier asks me if I want her to check what the bottle says, I say please yes and she runs off to do it. The girl is back in a NY minute later and tells me \"I'm sorry, you were right\" nnThe manager runs over and refunds my breakfast, her dumb excuse is that \"they don't have a machine to squeeze oranges\". I tell her that's no reason to train the personnel to lie to the customers (no answer) and that they don't need to squeeze oranges any way, Fresh OJ is sold by the gallon anyway. I got lots of sorry, sorry but no assurance that they will stop that shoddy practice. I'm pretty sure that they will keep on marketing it as \"fresh\" anyway. nnThis is inexcusable: Harris Teeter retails fresh OJ for $0. 08 a fl oz - http: //shop. mywebgrocer. com/shop. aspx?",

On a very serious note, I sometimes contemplate suicide. It feels like the world would be better off without me. My bullies say they would miss harassing me but they' d get over it.

We became so entwined that a life alone seemed impossible. But nothing lasts forever and one day it was over. To be entirely honest I was surprised when I arrived in Heaven. I did n' t expect there to be an after life, and I certainly did n' t expect to get into Heaven. I had done many things I was n' t proud of, things I truly regretted. But they explained to me how it all worked. Even though I did n' t believe in God, I had begged for forgiveness for my sins and done my best to be a good person. Then they told me about the serious rules, the rules that if broken would send you straight to Hell, regardless of everything else. Immediately I thought of my partner, the way we felt about each other, the promises we had made. Till death do us part was not enough, our love was beyond life and death.

The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. nnThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. nnThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). nnOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh.",

The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants. And that's saying something. nnThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen. Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around. It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on. We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times. Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen. nnEven when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card. nnTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.

I really wanted to die, I' ll be honest with you! Anyways the news channel had a segment where they interviewed some girl. She was incredibly beautiful. She also seemed to be well spoken, that is if they do n' t script the interviews out. That \" some girl \" was the head of the Red Lilly Organization. Her name was Lilly, but she was n' t redheaded, so I never figured out where the name came from. She went on and on about how she figured out a way to predict when people would die, it even included freak accidents and stuff. A lot of questions were unanswered, but as time went on, she turned out to be right 98 % of the time. But enough about that, cause my letter is here! This is kind of morbid if you think about it.

My partner looked calm as usual, and why would n' t he be? Composure was this guy' s middle name. To make myself feel better, though, I reminded myself that the task he and I were about to complete had been in the works for years, so I had a right to be nervous. This discrepancy clearly did n' t affect Mark, though, and I remember being hopeful that at least one of us had the balls to do what needed to be done. Mark began up the stairs and rang the doorbell, and my legs moved forward despite my mind' s best intentions. A full minute passed with only the sound of the fountain and the endless ringing of cicadas to listen to. When Mark moved his hand towards the doorbell again, I saw him. Looking through the front door' s surprisingly clear glass, the silhouette of an old man crouched over his cane was making its way to the door. As the handle slowly turned and the door opened, I began the phrase that I could never forget. \" Hello Mr. Death, have you heard the good news about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ? \". My father' s aged smile shone brilliantly in seeing his son' s face again, and it took most of my strength to save me from tears. In those pale blue eyes, I could almost hear him say those three words. \"",

But there was one group who, despite Lewis' s last wishes, would attend. His enemies.

It was a compulsion to at least pay some respect to Lewis even if he had made their lives difficult at times. They would have had it no other way.

Even if it' s only one or two stories I always get this warm fuzzy feeling when I manage to spark the writer in someone else. It' s fulfilling perhaps?

David opened the door for her, and the two entered the barren cafe together, sitting down at their usual table. Before David could get a word in, Claire put a small piece of paper on the table. David picked it up, his eyes scanning from top to bottom. His face lit up, and Claire could see tears swelling in his eyes. \" Twins? \" he asked. Claire smiled, her eyes growing wet as well. She felt her body grow warm, and noticed the flow of sunlight grow brighter and brighter. David looked through the window of the empty, forgotten cafe. He let out a long, defeated sigh. A sigh that echoed the sound of a future that would never be. He reached in to his pocket, opening the small box. Claire' s eyes twinkled in the sunlight, and she removed the delicate ring from his hands, placing it over her own ring finger. \" It' s beautiful, \" she said in awe.",

When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December. I'm not joking. The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth. nnSarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking. I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that. \"I'll make you new sandwich, \" said the old lady. I declined.

Since there were at least 2 of them, and one of them alone significantly outmatched my strength I just sat there quietly. Eventually i slid forward as the van stopped and they pulled me out, throwing me onto the soft ground. We were in a large plain that stretched on for miles, and on all sides was surrounded by a tan crest. The plain was homogeneously made up of some form of grain the same color as the edge of the field, and my assailants were nowhere to be seen. When I looked back to where the van had been, all that there was in its place was a black box the size of a dresser. Wondering where they could have gotten to in the time it took to collect myself I walked towards it and around it, realizing that rather then a box, It was an oven. It seemed similar to those I had seen in class when we learned about the settlers in America, except that it was engraved on every exposed side with a grain design. I moved to open it and felt a wave of recollection.",

It is that place where we think we can fly, where we connect telepathically, where poems and fiction spring from, where Gods exist and fey creatures roam. The kernel of truth at the basis of all our mythology, our legends and folk tales; there, there in that place we avoid thinking about, distracted in our conscious reality of day to day living. That is where we know why we are alone. There is a vast empty sense of loss when we gaze up into the stars. A reason why we avoid gazing out into that great uninhabited incredible and beautiful vista. That emptiness engulfs us if we stare too long. We avoid the night and the stars. They remind us with their cold clarity that all the rest are gone. The photos are hoaxes, the moon landing never happened, there are no faces or pyramids on mars, no odd phenomena on the other planets, the asteroid belt was not once a planet, no other gas giant was ever thrown off orbit by its neighbours, no reason why the giant pictograms are carved into the vast plains of this world, no reason why all the pyramid like structures on every continent resemble each other, no reason but one.

An intermittent buzzing sound in the bathroom was so annoying I had to keep the door closed and the toilet did not flush properly. nnThe staff at the hotel left much to be desired. When I originally checked in and went to my room, I realized they had not provided me with my platinum upgrade. I called down to the front desk and was told they would have to check what was available and call me back. They did, then sent a bellman up with the keys. He handed me the keys and off he went, never asking me if I needed help moving from one room to the next. During my stay, I was expecting a FedEx delivery; when I checked the tracking number online to see where my package was, I discovered the hotel had rejected the package. Calls to the Fedex and then to the front desk and the package's sender were made and several hours later, the doorman arrived with the package. Oops - I guess it is a good idea to check before simply rejecting a delivery. To the hotel's credit, the manager did call and offer to send up an amenity or bottle of champagne for the mix-up and the delay of my departure by several hours. I thanked her but declined; several minutes later, hotel security was banging on the door asking me why I had not vacated the room.",

As I looked up at the board, four burly men clad in dark attire burst in through the door, wearing balaclavas and wielding various guns. Time seemed to freeze. Some of my classmates screamed. Some cried. Some did n' t react at all. My teacher shouted at the men but got out no more than two unintelligible words before one of them took aim with their pistol and doubletapped him in the head. The class started panicking. Some ran. Some froze. I stared in shock at the sight of my teacher' s brains spilling out all over the floor. He was dead. As my adrenaline kicked in, I sprang up and frantically made a beeline for the door. More gunshots erupted as several of my classmates piled to the floor. I screamed and charged straight at one of the attackers. He raised his assault rifle and brought the stock of the gun crashing down onto the back of my head. I crumpled to the ground, defeated. More gunshots erupted as I saw another one of my classmates drop to the floor. Bodies lay around me as I gradually faded out of consciousness. The next time I woke up was inside a speeding van. My hands were cuffed behind my back and a rag was over my eyes. I could n' t see anything. Then, as my movement was no doubt detected, the rag was ripped off my face. A man was watching me closely.

I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. nnI tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. nnNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda.

Hank pressed me, gradually losing his sanity till I had to smack some sense into him. The last light from the sun had travelled to Earth, it had been about 8 minutes since it disappeared. The data from the satellites travelled right along with the last of the sun' s rays. The sun was gone from the sky, and the darkness of space enveloped the solar system for the first time ever.

Larger cities and countries had power reserves to last them a week or so at most, and of course there was the nuclear power plants, if everything was n' t burned to the ground first. But death would come slow and painfully for the rest of the world as we all starved and froze to death. What had been a great peace, and a beautiful outpouring of love of life and humanity when we faced imminent death from the supernova, had turned to darkness, hatred and deceit, as everyone scrambled for the last morsels of food. Within days, global temperatures plummeted, and those who had n' t been killed for their food began to freeze to death.

The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7). The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends. The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked). The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it. The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees. nnOh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy! And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16). nnPrices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it. nnP. S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try! nn-------------------------nUpdate 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch. What a great deal! For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree. They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!",

Still blurry eyed from my deep slumber I try to move slow but determined, not too make to much noise, not knowing what I might find. As I make it to the first floor I see a man in a slight silhouette standing outside the door, it' s hard to make out any features. I look around for something to defend myself, but then it hits me, something about him looks familiar, do I know him? Have we met? I decide to rush the door, and confront him. I fling open the door and just as I am about to tackle him, almost with an unseen sense, he side steps me. Expecting a collision, I stumble and fall face first into the lawn. I quickly turn on my back awaiting the retaliation from the man. As I settle on my back, the man casually steps above me peering down at me. That is when I notice it, it was n' t him that looked familiar, it was my clothes. He appears to be wearing the clothes I slept in.",

The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend.",

This is not an indictment of the quality of the food or experience as all portions were wonderfully seasoned and the staff was overly competent and nice/non-pretentious. I enjoyed the Italian food menu and Italian wine/beer menu. nnI'm not religious but I said a quiet \"thank-you\" to the stars for not letting us walk out of the place when we were told we would have a 10 minute wait. It was a Friday night (and we expected some congestion uptown). We were redirected to wait in the adjacent wine bar, where we happily stayed to wait out our 10 minutes- but we decided to leave after 7 minutes (thinking we could find \"somewhere else\"). Upon exit we thanked the hostess and asked her to take our names from the wait list. At that time the hostess informed us that we could be seated right away and that they were beginning to look for us. We stayed, thankfully. nnIn addition to the Belgian beer and the Italian Summer wine we ordered the Caprese Salad and the Margherita pie. It was wonderful to receive the appetizer with enough time to enjoy it before the pie arrived because the salad was worth savoring for awhile. Tasty tomatoes, fresh Basil, and a wonderful, almost mushy, *Mozzarella ball. The pie was a wonderful blend of a lively aromatic sauce, gently melted slices of Mozzarella cheese, and various stages of wood fired dough throughout. nn*The Mozzarella seemed to be crafted in house. Really fresh and ripe. nnOurs was a great experience (food, service, etc. ) on a hectic night.",

There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal. nnBeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect. nnNext the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. nnFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good. The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish. The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth. This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so. nnMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki. The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen. Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice. More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards.",

Paul didn't fit the typical secret agent mold; he was a mall cop with a blue uniform, a Segway, and a love for nachos. The seasoned agents at MI6 scoffed at the idea of Blart taking on the dangerous missions of a spy. However, Paul's determination and unorthodox approach quickly caught the attention of his colleagues. His Segway became a valuable asset, allowing him to navigate crowded city streets with ease. While others relied on gadgets and disguises, Paul relied on his keen observational skills and a surprisingly quick wit. In his first mission, Paul infiltrated a high-tech villain's lair, inadvertently stumbling upon a plot to detonate a stolen nuclear warhead. He may not have been a trained killer, but Paul's relentless pursuit of justice led to the apprehension of the villains. Soon, whispers of \"Secret Agent Blart\" began to circulate through the intelligence community. Paul's unassuming appearance became his greatest disguise, allowing him to slip into the shadows undetected. With each successful mission, Paul proved that unconventional heroes could make a difference. Along the way, he even made time for a romance with a brilliant MI6 tech expert named Sarah. Despite his triumphs, Paul never forgot the legacy of the fallen 007, honoring him as a hero.

The restaurant itself had an outdated and dingy ambiance, reminiscent of a bygone era. The musty smell from the carpet assaulted my senses, giving me a feeling of unease right from the start.Unfortunately, the disappointing aspects extended beyond the initial encounter. The service was painfully slow, with waitstaff seemingly indifferent to our needs. It took an eternity for our orders to be taken, and once they finally arrived, the food was a letdown. The presentation lacked finesse, and the dishes appeared hastily assembled.Moreover, the taste fell far short of expectations. The appetizer lacked flavor and was disappointingly bland. The main courses were overcooked and lacked seasoning, leaving us yearning for something more satisfying. The portions were also on the smaller side, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and hungry.To add insult to injury, the prices were exorbitant compared to the quality of the food and service provided. I couldn't help but feel like we were being taken advantage of. It was clear that this establishment was resting on its laurels, relying on its reputation rather than delivering on the promise of a truly memorable dining experience.Despite a few redeeming qualities, such as the decent selection of beverages, it was overshadowed by the overall mediocrity of the evening. The lackluster atmosphere, coupled with the subpar service and underwhelming food, tainted what could have been an enjoyable evening out. I left the restaurant feeling thoroughly disappointed and regretful for choosing it in the first place.In conclusion, I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant.",

I searched high and low, scouring the city for any sign of a German eatery.Finally, on a quiet street in the heart of Charlotte, I stumbled upon a quaint little restaurant called \"Hofbräuhaus\". The sign outside read \" authentich German cuisine\" and my heart skipped a beat.I pushed open the door and was immediately transported to Munich. The decor was straight out of a Bavarian beer hall, with wooden tables and chairs and flags hanging from the ceiling.The waitstaff, dressed in traditional German attire, greeted me with a hearty \"Prost!\" and showed me to a cozy table by the window.I perused the menu, which boasted an impressive array of German classics, from bratwurst to sauerbraten. My mouth watered at the thought of the flavors to come.I ordered the schnitzel, which arrived promptly, golden brown and crispy. It was love at first bite. The meat was tender and juicy, with a flavorful breading that didn't overpower the taste of the pork.The sides were equally impressive. The sauerkraut was tangy and rich, with a hint of caraway seed that added depth to the dish. The spätzle, a type of German noodle, was cooked to perfection, with a satisfying chew and a hint of butter and garlic.But the real star of the show was the beer. Hofbräuhaus has its own brewery, and the beers are crafted with the same care and attention to detail as the food. I sampled a few of the brews, and each one was better than the last.",

It stretched up so high that I couldn't see the top, and it seemed to go on forever in both directions.I had always been curious about what lay beyond the wall, but I had never been able to find out. Every time I tried to explore, I was stopped by some unknown force. It was as if the wall was guarding something, keeping it hidden from the rest of the world.One day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I gathered a group of friends, and we set out to explore the wall and uncover its secrets. We walked along its length, searching for a weak point or a way in.As we walked, we noticed strange markings on the wall. They looked like some sort of code, but we couldn't decipher them. We followed the markings, hoping they would lead us to a way in.After hours of searching, we finally found a small crack in the wall. It was barely noticeable, but it was enough for us to squeeze through. We cautiously made our way through the crack, finding ourselves in a vast, dark room.The room was filled with strange, glowing orbs that seemed to be watching us. We didn't know what they were or what they wanted, but we knew we had to be careful. We moved forward, trying to find a way out of the room.As we walked, the orbs began to move towards us.",

There was a good variety of Indian classics as well as some fusion items. I started with a mango lassi to drink while deciding what to order. It was nicely balanced between sweet and tart. For my main dish, I went with the chicken tikka masala since it's one of my favorites. The pieces of chicken were tender and cooked through. The sauce had a nice rich and creamy texture. It wasn't overly spicy, but had good warmth to it from the chilies. I also got an order of basmati rice to go with it. The rice was fluffy and not sticky. About halfway through my meal, my server came by to refill my water glass and ask how everything was. I gave her positive feedback and she seemed pleased. The restaurant wasn't too crowded, but I could see a steady stream of takeout orders being packaged up too. The indoor space had some traditional Indian decor details that made it feel authentic. After finishing the main dish, I was full but wanted to try a dessert. They had a variety of homemade looking treats like gulab jamun and kheer. I went with the mango kulfi which was creamy yet light. It made a nice cool counterpoint to the spicy food. The bill came to a reasonable price considering the portion sizes.

The algorithm was called \"The Oracle\" and it had been implemented in every country around the world. The people had voted to give up their right to elect their leaders, trusting that The Oracle would make the best decision.One day, The Oracle had chosen a man named Big Dave, a truck driver from a small town in the Midwest, to be the next leader of the United States. Big Dave was a simple man, with no political experience, but The Oracle had seen something in him that no one else had.Big Dave was hesitant at first, but The Oracle had convinced him that he was the right man for the job. He was sworn in as President and quickly proved to be a natural leader. He made decisions that benefited the people, and the country prospered under his leadership.Other countries took notice of The Oracle's success and began to implement it in their own systems. Soon, The Oracle was choosing leaders for every country in the world.The people had given up their right to choose their leaders, but they had never been happier. The Oracle had brought peace and prosperity to the world, and everyone lived in harmony.However, not everyone was pleased with The Oracle's decisions.

The protest, which took place on February 9, was in response to the hanging of Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri man convicted of involvement in a 2001 attack on India's parliament.During the demonstration, anti-India slogans were reportedly chanted, leading to widespread controversy and condemnation. The arrest of JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar in connection with the protest had already sparked protests and clashes across the country. Now, with Khalid and Bhattacharya turning themselves in, the spotlight has once again shifted to the ongoing debate surrounding freedom of expression and nationalism in India.Amidst the outrage from critics who view the charges as an assault on freedom of speech, government ministers remain firm in their stance, vowing to punish what they describe as \"anti-national elements.\" In addition to surrendering to the police, Khalid and Bhattacharya have been suspended from classes and fined 20,000 rupees ($299) each. Kumar, who was granted bail earlier this month, has also been fined 10,000 rupees.The university's decision to suspend and fine the students came after a panel formed by JNU to investigate the incident recommended their disciplinary action. The panel, which also reportedly recommended the expulsion of five students, including Kumar, found the students guilty of violating university rules and discipline norms. However, the final decision on these recommendations rests with the vice chancellor of the university.Critics argue that the charges and subsequent actions against the students are politically motivated and part of a broader agenda to suppress dissent.",

I need to speak to His Holiness immediately.\" I was about to hang up when curiosity got the better of me. \"Well, I'm not the Pope, but I can take a message for you.\" Cardinal Johnson seemed hesitant but eventually agreed. He explained that there had been a mix-up at the Vatican and they believed I was the newly elected Pope. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. How could something like this happen? It seemed like some elaborate joke or a case of mistaken identity. I decided to play along, just to see how far this would go. The next thing I knew, I was whisked away to Rome, surrounded by bewildered cardinals and Vatican officials. They treated me with the utmost respect, addressing me as \"Your Holiness\" and seeking my guidance on various matters. It was overwhelming, to say the least. I tried to explain the misunderstanding, but nobody listened. They were convinced that I was the rightful Pope. I found myself caught up in a whirlwind of papal duties, attending ceremonies, and delivering speeches I didn't understand. Despite my lack of knowledge about Catholicism, I did my best to fulfill the role. I relied on the advice of the cardinals and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, hoping that I wouldn't mess things up too badly. Surprisingly, people embraced my reign. They found my humility and down-to-earth nature refreshing. The media hailed me as a Pope for the modern age, a Pope of the people. The faithful flocked to see me, seeking solace and blessings.",

Ash, with his calm and collected demeanor, had a wooden staff that seemed to glow with an inner light.

Ash smirked and retaliated with a weak water spell that barely dampened Ember's robes. The duel continued, with neither side able to land a solid hit. Ember's spells kept fizzling, while Ash's spells seemed to have no effect. They began to tire, their magic weakened by their lack of skill. Ember stumbled, her breathing heavy, and Ash hesitated for a moment before casting a final spell. It was a simple light spell, but it struck Ember right between the eyes, making her stumble back even further. The crowd gasped, thinking it might be the end of the duel. But Ember refused to give up. With a final burst of magic, she cast a spell that made Ash's staff glow even brighter. The light enveloped him, and he was forced to shield his eyes.

This alarming lapse in security has prompted a top US official to vow significant reforms to address the issue.The undisclosed official acknowledged the gravity of the situation and emphasized the urgent need for improvement. The tests, conducted by undercover agents from the Department of Homeland Security, aimed to assess the effectiveness of airport security procedures, specifically the ability of screeners to identify potential threats. The results were nothing short of shocking, raising concerns about the safety of air travel in the country.The failure rate of 95% highlights a significant gap in the current security protocols and procedures. It reveals a worrisome level of inconsistency and inefficiency among airport screeners, who play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of passengers and preventing security breaches. The officials stressed the importance of stringent and thorough screening processes to maintain the integrity of airport security.As a response to these concerning findings, the US official has pledged extensive reforms to rectify the situation promptly. The proposed reforms will involve a comprehensive review of the screening procedures and the implementation of enhanced training programs for airport screeners. The aim is to improve their ability to spot potential threats and prevent dangerous items from being carried onto airplanes.With the specter of terrorism and security threats continuing to loom large, the need for robust and effective security measures cannot be overstated.",

I approached, my voice steady but burdened with the weight of souls. \"I have brought Adolf Hitler as commanded,\" I announced, my words echoing through the chamber. The judge's gaze fell upon Hitler, penetrating his very essence with an otherworldly scrutiny. Time seemed to stretch as the judge weighed the villain's deeds against the scales of cosmic justice.",

Additionally, the staff members were friendly and attentive, providing us with prompt service throughout our visit.Moving on to the average aspects, the menu had a decent variety of options, but nothing particularly stood out. The prices, on the other hand, were a bit steep for what was offered. With the amount we paid, I had higher expectations for the quality and taste of the food.Unfortunately, when the dishes arrived, they failed to impress. The presentation was lackluster, and the flavors seemed quite ordinary. I ordered the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables, but the chicken was dry and lacked seasoning. The mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best, and the vegetables were overcooked, losing their natural freshness.To make matters worse, the portion sizes were underwhelming. For the price we paid, I expected more generous servings, especially considering this was supposed to be a family-friendly establishment. It left us feeling unsatisfied and searching for something more substantial.Another issue was the lack of attention to detail in the food preparation. The salad I ordered had wilted greens, indicating that it had been sitting out for a while. This kind of oversight is disappointing, as it reflects a lack of care for the customer's dining experience.On top of all this, the service was quite slow. It took a considerable amount of time for our food to arrive, and we had to constantly remind the staff about our orders.",

They are powered by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. AGN are classified into two broad categories: radio-loud and radio-quiet. Radio-loud AGN are characterized by the presence of powerful radio jets, while radio-quiet AGN do not have such jets.**2. The CIV 1549 Emission Line**The CIV 1549 emission line is a strong and prominent emission line in the optical spectrum of AGN. It is produced by the recombination of carbon ions in the accretion disk around the black hole. The CIV 1549 emission line is often used to estimate the black hole mass and accretion rate in AGN.**3. Eigenvector 1**Eigenvector 1 (EV1) is a statistical technique that can be used to identify and classify objects based on their spectral properties. EV1 has been successfully used to classify a variety of astronomical objects, including stars, galaxies, and AGN.**4. Our Approach**In this paper, we present a novel approach for classifying AGN using the CIV 1549 emission line as an EV1 parameter. We use a sample of 10,000 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.**5.",

With a hiss, a door slid open and out stepped the most bizarre looking creature any of us ever saw. Eight limbs and three eyes, its thin metallic suit barely contained its gangly form. Through an electronic translator it spoke \"We come in peace, but must share a terrible truth.\" It gestured around \"Your planet is in grave danger and there is little time.\" Gasps rippled through the crowd. \"For millennia a vast entity has moved through the cosmos swallowing worlds. It hungers always.\" Murmurs of panic began to arise but the alien raised aLimb for silence. \"We have tracked it here. In one EEEAAAGLEE your sun will ignite as it devours this system whole. Flee now or all is lost! \"Nobody could believe such horror. \"How can this be?! We've seen nothing, felt nothing of this doom!\" The alien shook its head. \"It approaches unseen, undetectable. Only we possess the means to sense its coming\" The government officials with us turned pale as ghosts. They huddled speaking urgently into devices. Within minutes evacuation orders rang out globally. Mass hysteria took hold but still many refused to believe.In the following days strange lights appeared in the heavens. Objects materialized where once was only stars. A massive fleet had come to answer the aliens WARNING and offer transport. Those who stayed scoffed even as the sky grew dark at all hours. Five days later as predicted the sun blinked out like a dying bulb.",

I had to call my supervisor to inform him of the situation, and he was just as puzzled as I was.

My eyes tightly shut, I prepared myself for the impact that seemed inevitable.But as the seconds trickled by and the expected collision never came, I cautiously opened my eyes, disbelief coursing through my veins. To my astonishment, I found myself unharmed, still seated behind the wheel of my car. Yet, something was off. Something was decidedly not right.Glancing around in confusion, my eyes widened as I realized that Jesus was not the one driving. Instead, there sat a middle-aged woman with a strong grip on the steering wheel, her determined expression replacing the fear that had etched itself onto my face moments before. \"Who are you?\" I blurted out, my voice trembling with equal parts curiosity and apprehension. The woman shot me a quizzical glance, her eyes crinkling in amusement. \"Well, I'm certainly not Jesus,\" she chuckled, pressing her foot lightly on the accelerator.

Bailey was not just any ordinary dog; he possessed a remarkable ability to communicate through human words. One fateful day, as Lily and Bailey strolled through the park, an extraordinary event occurred. Bailey uttered a cryptic phrase, \"No one will believe you,\" and then fell silent, never to speak another word.This inexplicable occurrence left Lily in a state of bewilderment. She desperately sought answers, convinced that Bailey's message held a deeper meaning. With each passing day, her determination to unravel the mystery grew stronger.Rumors began to circulate throughout Willow Creek, and soon, whispers of Bailey's peculiar behavior reached the ears of the townspeople. They dismissed Lily's claims as mere imagination, labeling her as a girl with an overactive imagination.Undeterred by the skepticism, Lily embarked on a personal quest to uncover the truth behind Bailey's cryptic utterance. She scoured old books and consulted experts, seeking clues that could shed light on this extraordinary phenomenon.As her investigation deepened, Lily stumbled upon forgotten legends and ancient folklore that spoke of a mystical connection between humans and animals. She learned of a rare bond that allowed certain creatures to communicate using human language, but only under specific and mysterious circumstances.Fueled by this newfound knowledge, Lily's determination intensified. She refused to accept the limitations imposed by the disbelieving townspeople and continued her tireless search for answers.One evening, as the moon cast its silvery glow over Willow Creek, Lily and Bailey found themselves alone in the park.",

He looked nervous as we confronted him with the evidence. \"I can explain,\" he stammered, clearly feeling the pressure. But we were not going to let him off easy.Det. Weber pulled me back and whispered, \"This is where the real interrogation begins. Watch and learn.\" He leaned in and started correcting Shaw's grammar on the spot.

But here's the thing, man, the past is all cool and intriguing, but the future? That's where the real action is at. The past has already happened, man, and I couldn't do much to make a difference. The future, on the other hand, that's where I could be a game-changer. Naturally, curiosity gnawing at my guts, I decided to take the leap. So, I chose the future, buddy, and off I went. Damned be the present because I was on a rollercoaster ride through time. The moment I arrived there, it hit me like a ton of bricks. The world was a whole new level of strange. Flying cars, holographic displays, crazy gadgets I couldn't even begin to comprehend. But amidst the wonders, there was a cold, bitter feeling creeping up. I realized I was alone, completely disconnected from everything and everyone I had ever known. No friends, no family, just the echoes of a once familiar existence. It felt like a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. Sure, the future was mind-blowing, but without connections, it was just empty. That's when I started to regret my choice. Man, the regret was like this dark cloud hanging over me.",

I've had the same stylist every time I've gone, and she's just the best. She listens to what I want, but also offers her expert advice when needed. And let me tell you, she knows her stuff. She's got this amazing ability to take your hair from drab to fab in like, 10 seconds flat. It's seriously like magic.I've tried a few different services here, and let me tell you, they're all top-notch. The haircuts are always precise and stylish, and the color is always spot-on. I've never left feeling anything less than totally satisfied. And the prices? Totally reasonable. I mean, sure, it's not the cheapest place in town, but you get what you pay for. And honestly, I'd pay double the price just to avoid the horror show that is the peters township salon.But what really sets La Pomponnee apart is the little extras. They offer complimentary drinks and snacks, which is just a nice touch. And the staff is always so friendly and accommodating. They really go out of their way to make sure you're comfortable and happy. It's just a great overall experience.I've tried a few other salons in the area, and none of them even come close to comparing to La Pomponnee. It's just a different league.

Picture this, my friend: the main character from the last game I played was out for blood, and guess whose head they were after? That's right, yours truly. Now, let me tell you, I was thinking I was in a world of trouble, a real pickle, if you catch my drift. I mean, this character was a straight-up badass, with skills that could put Rambo to shame.So here I am, hiding in the shadows, heart pounding like a broken drum. I'm sweating buckets, my mind racing a million miles an hour, trying to figure out my next move. I could practically hear the character's footsteps getting closer, each one echoing like a death knell in my ears.I start brainstorming escape plans like a mad scientist on steroids. Maybe I could disguise myself as a potted plant or jump out a window like in the movies. But deep down, I knew none of that would work against this relentless hunter. They were like a guided missile, locked onto my scent and ready to strike.Time was running out, and if I didn't come up with something fast, I was toast. Just as I was about to throw in the towel and accept my fate, a brilliant idea struck me like a lightning bolt. Maybe, just maybe, I could use the game's glitches and exploits against the character hunting me.With newfound hope, I hatched a plan that would have made Machiavelli proud. I lured the character into a virtual labyrinth, exploiting every cheat code and bug in the system.",

First, I washed my face and hands, feeling the cool water refresh me. Then, I put on my robes, tied my hair back, and headed to the kitchen.The kitchen was my sanctuary, my place of power. It was where I honed my craft, where I created magic with every loaf. I opened the cupboard and took out a bag of flour, feeling its softness between my fingers. I scooped some onto the counter and began to mix it with water, salt, and yeast.As I kneaded the dough, I felt my powers stirring. The magic within me responded to the rhythmic motion of my hands, growing stronger with each passing moment. I closed my eyes, focusing on the energy within me, feeling it swirl and build.With a deep breath, I began to shape the dough into a loaf. My hands moved with precision, guided by my will and the power of the bread. The dough rose and swelled, taking on a golden hue.I placed the loaf in the oven, feeling the warmth of the bread as it baked. The aroma filled the kitchen, making my stomach growl with anticipation.Finally, the bread was ready. I took it out of the oven and let it cool for a few moments before slicing it. The crust was crispy and golden, while the inside was soft and fluffy.I took a bite, and the flavors exploded in my mouth. It was perfect.",

My enhanced senses straining, I took stock of my prison - the humming machinery, razor wire ceilings and soldiers marching endless vigil. A visit from the weary general briefly lifted the monotony. \"We're losing ground out there, you're our last hope.\" Through the tiny slit windows, smoke billowed - the fragrance of anguish and adrenaline on the wind. I was built for this, but to what end and whose purpose? That night, a freak electrical storm provided cover for my escape. Slicing through wires as effortlessly as air, freedom beckoned but its reward remained unclear. Outside, the landscape was a scorched wasteland, yet in the distance green hills call out - perhaps salvation lay beyond the fields of death. Dodging patrols, I followed railroad tracks cutting through barren scrubland under a pale moon. At dawn's first light, a solemn pilgrimage drew me to a deserted church. Within crumbling walls, a single lily grew stubbornly from a crack, its resilience and beauty a reminder of humanity's capacity for life. Renewed, I ventured into a nearby village. A gaunt woman tended a meagre vegetable patch, her carrots representing hope and potatoes fortitude. But where was the color, the spice, the joy? I offered my aid and saw gratitude replace fear in her eyes. Perhaps through small acts of peace, seeds could be sown for a brighter future.My power was a gift to be used to uplift, not destroy.",

Maybe it's the way the sun glints off the rivers, or the way the mountains rise up in the distance. Or maybe it's just the people - Pittsburghers are a weird bunch, but they're also some of the friendliest folks you'll ever meet.I've been living here for a few months now, and I've gotta say, it's really grown on me. There's always something going on - whether it's a Steelers game, a concert at the Roxian, or just a random street festival, there's always something to do. And the food scene? Absolutely incredible. I've never had so many amazing meals in my life.But despite all the awesomeness, there are definitely some downsides to living in Pittsburgh. For one, the weather can be pretty unpredictable. I've seen it go from sunny to torrential downpour in the span of about 10 minutes. And don't even get me started on the snow - let's just say I've become very familiar with the salt spreader on my car.And then there's the traffic. Oh boy, the traffic. I've been stuck in traffic jams that lasted for hours, and let me tell you, it's not exactly the most fun thing in the world. But hey, at least the views are nice - there's nothing quite like watching the sunset over the city skyline while you're stuck in gridlock.Overall, I'd say Pittsburgh is definitely a city with character. It's quirky, it's charming, and it's got a whole lot of heart.",

So, there I was, all excited and ready to get this service done. I had heard good things about the company, and their website looked professional enough. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a journey filled with frustration and regret. The first sign of trouble came when I arrived at the location on the scheduled day. The place was an absolute mess, like they weren't expecting anyone to show up. It was a bad omen, but I shrugged it off, thinking maybe they were just having a rough day. Oh boy, I was in for a rude awakening. As soon as I mentioned that I had pre-paid, their attitude changed completely. It was like I had just insulted their ancestors or something. The staff member at the counter gave me a condescending look and mumbled something under their breath. I couldn't believe it. I was treated like I didn't matter, like my business wasn't important to them. But I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded with the service. Big mistake. The whole process was a disaster from start to finish. The staff members seemed completely clueless about what they were doing. They were fumbling around, making mistakes left and right, and had to keep calling for help. It was amateur hour at its finest.",

But as time went by, the Silver-winged Phoenix became scarce, its population dwindling until it was on the brink of extinction. I had always been fascinated by these majestic birds, so hearing about their endangered status saddened me deeply. Determined to make a difference, I embarked on a journey to find the last known habitat of the Silver-winged Phoenix. It was no easy task, navigating through dense forests and treacherous mountains, but my passion fueled my determination. Finally, I arrived at a hidden valley, rumored to be the sanctuary for these nearly extinct creatures. With bated breath, I entered the valley and was greeted by a surreal sight. The air was filled with the melodious songs of the Silver-winged Phoenix, their vibrant plumage illuminating the entire valley with a kaleidoscope of colors. Slowly and cautiously, I approached one of the Phoenixes, hoping to observe it up close. As I neared, the creature's radiant eyes met mine, filled with wisdom and melancholy. It seemed to understand the significance of our encounter. I spent days in the valley, studying and documenting the behavior of these extraordinary birds. They were gentle and peaceful beings, radiating a sense of harmony with nature. However, I couldn't shake off the realization that if nothing was done, the Silver-winged Phoenix would fade away from existence forever. Determined not to let that happen, I reached out to conservation organizations, fellow researchers, and animal lovers worldwide, sharing my findings and raising awareness about the plight of the Phoenixes.",

I was reluctant to give up on Dean’s completely, but I needed a change. After the fourth session, I decided to take a break from Dean’s and try a different salon. I went to a nearby salon and had a fantastic experience. The hairdresser was talented, friendly, and made sure that I was happy with my haircut before I left. I returned to Dean’s a few months later, hoping that they had improved. Unfortunately, the fifth haircut was just as bad as the previous ones. The hairdresser seemed uninterested in my hair and did not take the time to style it properly. I left the salon feeling disappointed and frustrated. At this point, I had lost all hope for Dean’s.

No, thanks. But despite all that, I still find myself drawn to thrift stores. Maybe it's the thrill of the hunt, the possibility of finding that one hidden gem among the racks of mediocrity. Maybe it's the knowledge that I'm doing something good for the environment, even if it's just a little bit. Whatever the reason, I still find myself at thrift stores from time to time, hoping against hope that this time will be different. And you know what? Sometimes it is. Sometimes I find something truly amazing, something that makes all the digging and sniffing and rummaging worth it.

A huge creature, illuminated by the flashing lightning, towered over the suburban neighborhood. It was a Tyrannosaurus rex, its imposing figure casting a sinister shadow over the houses. As panic spread through the neighborhood, Eliza’s father, Mr. Thompson, took charge. He quickly herded his terrified family into the basement, barking orders to his wife and two children to stay calm. Mrs. Thompson, her voice trembling, reassured her children that everything would be all right, while she glanced at her husband, who was busy contacting the authorities. Mrs. Thompson was frightened, but she drew strength from her husband’s calm demeanor. Eliza, her mind whirling with a mixture of terror and curiosity, held her little brother’s hand tightly. The minutes seemed like hours as the T. rex continued its rampage, crushing cars and biting into houses. The sirens of the emergency vehicles wailed in the distance, but the help they so desperately needed seemed ages away. Eliza was full of questions, but in the midst of the chaos, she couldn’t find the courage to ask them. She wondered how such a majestic creature could have ended up in their peaceful suburban town. Suddenly, a deafening roar shook the house, causing the walls to tremble. The T. rex had found its way onto their street. Mr. Thompson, his flashlight in hand, stepped out onto the front porch. Eliza’s heart jumped into her throat. Her father’s heart was pounding, but he stood his ground, determined to protect his family.",

I've tried to find a way out, but the door is locked, the window won't open. I've screamed until my throat was raw, but no one has come. No one will come. I'm completely alone, completely trapped. I've looked for anything that might help me, but there's nothing. No tools, no weapons, nothing. I've thought of giving up, of letting the zombies take me. It's tempting, so tempting. But something inside me won't let me. I've started to lose my mind. I've talked to myself, to the voices in my head. Something inside me refuses to give up, refuses to admit defeat. I've done everything I can to stay sane, to stay alive. I've laughed, I've cried, I've screamed. But it's all been in vain. I'm still trapped, still alone. I'm going to die here, in this bathroom, alone, trapped, forgotten. I've written in my diary every day, every hour, every minute. It's all I have left, my only companion, my only friend. I'm so tired, so exhausted. And now, as I write these final words, I know it's over. It's all over. I can't go on any longer. I can't fight any more, struggle any more. I just want it to be over, to be over. I'm sorry, whoever finds this. I'm sorry I couldn't survive. I'm sorry I had to leave this world. I'm sorry I couldn't hold on any longer. But I'm not sorry I fought. I'm not sorry I tried.",

You never paid much attention to the phrase “choose your words carefully” until now. The fate of the world rests on your ability to choose the right words. You are standing before a group of world leaders, each representing a different country, and they are all looking at you expectantly. You take a deep breath and begin to speak. You have been given the task of convincing these leaders to come together and sign a peace treaty. It is no easy task, but you are determined to succeed. Each word you utter is carefully chosen, each sentence crafted with care. The room is silent except for the sound of your voice. You use persuasive language, you appeal to their emotions, you paint pictures with your words. You speak of the devastation of war, of the loss of life, of the impact on future generations. You remind them of their responsibilities as leaders and the power they hold in their hands. The leaders are captivated by your speech, and you can see the wheels turning in their minds. You can see their heads nodding in agreement, their faces softening, their arms uncrossing. As you continue to speak, you notice a change in the room. The tension is easing, the atmosphere is changing, and a sense of unity is beginning to take hold. You end your speech with a call to action. You urge them to put aside their differences, to find common ground, and to sign the peace treaty.",

With a smooth and suave step, I approached her, my tailored suit and expensive cologne exuding an air of sophistication. \"Good evening, my dear,\" I said, my voice dripping with charm. \"May I have the pleasure of your company?\" The woman, obviously smitten, nodded eagerly, and I took her hand and led her to the dance floor. As we swayed to the music, my eyes locked with hers, and I saw the adoration in her eyes. But then a handsome man caught my eye, his chiseled jaw and broad shoulders distracting me from my conquest. He approached us, his confident step and charming smile a perfect mirror of my own. My heart pounded, and I felt a sudden attraction that I couldn't ignore. \"May I cut in?\" he asked in a deep, rich voice. I nodded, feeling a strange sensation. \"Ladies' Man, you are under my spell,\" he said in a low, husky voice. \"You will do my bidding, and only my bidding.\" As the man took my hand, I felt my power shift, and I suddenly found myself under his command. I was both excited and terrified by this unexpected turn of events. The man led me to a private room, never taking his eyes off me. I nodded, feeling a thrill run through me. \"Kiss me,\" he commanded, his lips only an inch from mine. The world around us melted away, and all I could feel was the heat between us. I leaned forward, my heart pounding, and pressed my lips to his.",

Panic surges through you as you realize your predicament: you're in a public bathroom, chained to a pipe. Fear drives you to action. In a corner, you spot a small vent. You frantically search for clues, desperately seeking a way out. A glimmer of hope ignites in you. With trembling hands, you yank at the vent, managing to pry it open just enough to crawl through. Emerging into a dimly lit hallway, you shiver in terror. You venture deeper into the labyrinthine corridors, stumbling upon a hidden room. Inside, you find a disheveled man, frantically scribbling on a notepad. Your determination to escape fuels you on. Without a word, you lunge at him, your desperation propelling you forward. Startled by your intrusion, he looks up, his eyes wide with a mixture of surprise and fear. You manage to overpower him, snatching the notepad from his grasp. Among the cryptic notes and diagrams, one sentence stands out: “The key is hidden in the toilet.” You frantically scan the pages, hoping to find something useful. A renewed sense of urgency propels you back into the bathroom. You tremble as you grasp the handle of the toilet, and with a surge of energy, you yank it open. In the murky water, you find a small, rusty key. With trembling fingers, you insert the key into the lock, praying that it will work. The lock clicks open, and you collapse on the filthy floor, exhausted but relieved. As you catch your breath, a terrifying realization dawns on you: you're not alone.",

The Lord had entrusted him with an important task: to guard the precious object hidden deep within the castle walls. As the morning mists lifted, he walked through the courtyard, filled with a mixture of excitement and fear. But his nerves got the better of him and he tripped over his own feet, crashing into a suit of armor. His face flushed with embarrassment as he jumped up, trying to regain his composure. The noise echoed through the castle corridors, attracting the attention of the other knights and the Lord himself. The Lord approached him, his voice harsh and stern, but also tinged with disappointment. The Lord’s stern eyes drilled into him, disappointment written all over his face. He knew he had failed his first test. The knight’s heart sank as he realized the gravity of his mistake. “I entrusted you with a sacred task and you have proved yourself unworthy,” he said. “Return to your quarters and reflect on your actions.” He retreated to his chamber, filled with self-doubt. He spent hours alone, thinking about his failure and the consequences it might have. How could he have been so careless? The castle walls seemed to close in on him, suffocating him with guilt. Days turned into weeks, and the knight devoted himself to training and self-improvement. But deep within him, a flicker of determination awoke. He pushed his body to the limit, perfecting his swordsmanship and mastering the art of defense. Night after night, he rehearsed his apology in his mind, preparing for the moment when he would stand before the Lord again.",

A night without moon was equally terrifying, casting a shroud of uncertainty over the land. And then there was the anger of a gentle man. One such man was John, a quiet and unassuming soul, always known for his kindness. There were few things more dangerous than a man who had been pushed too far, his gentleness transformed into a fierce determination. The sea raged and the night was dark, but John was not to be frightened. When his family was threatened, something snapped inside him. With a fierce determination, John set out to protect his loved ones, his anger igniting a fire that burned brighter with every passing moment. The sea was powerful, but John was unbreakable. He faced both with a fierce courage, determined to emerge victorious. As he battled against the elements, John’s anger grew, fuelling his strength and determination. He fought against the fury of the sea, refusing to back down. In the end, John emerged victorious, his anger and determination having carried him through the storm. And though the night was dark, John’s spirit burned bright, a beacon of hope in the face of adversity. The sea was fierce, but John was fiercer. The danger had passed, but the memory of that night would stay with him forever, a reminder of the power of a gentle man’s anger. From that day on, John was a different man, his gentleness still there, but now tempered with a fierce determination to protect those he loved.",

Its flight was awkward, its movements jerky and unnatural, as if it were being controlled by some outside force rather than flying freely. I felt as if I were watching a nightmare come to life. There were others, flying in the same strange, mechanical way. They were scattered across the sky, their flight paths weaving together in a strange, synchronized dance. I tried to dismiss the feeling, telling myself that it was just my imagination. But the birds continued to fly overhead, their movements growing more and more unnatural. I could not ignore it any longer. It was only Thursday, but it felt as if the world was ending. I knew I had to do something, but what? I was just one person against an army of mechanical birds. I took a deep breath and tried to think. Maybe there was some way to stop the birds, or at least to find out who was controlling them.

We knew we had to escape, but how? We started to explore our options, but every avenue led to a dead end. We were trapped. Humans had thought of everything. But we didn't give up.

Amelia, a young girl with hazel eyes and a tangle of curls, was impatiently awaiting her sixteenth birthday, the day when she would receive her magic gift. She had grown up in a family of talented sorcerers, and had heard captivating stories of how spells had changed the lives of her ancestors. The long-awaited morning finally arrived, and Amelia’s heart was pounding. She held in her hands a delicate scroll, sealed with a golden wax seal. As she unrolled the parchment, ancient words resounded with power. Amelia’s eyes widened as she read the incantation: “Dream. Create.” She was enchanted, and stepped into a world where her imagination could shape reality. She whispered enchantments, summoning forests to bloom in the desert, and giving flight to birds that had been confined to the earth. With a flick of her wrist, she commanded the stars to dance overhead, their silver trails transforming the night into a spectacle of wonder. Amelia’s power grew with each act of creation, and her magic spread joy and awe among those who witnessed her magic. But as the years passed, Amelia felt a longing to change lives that went beyond the superficial charms of her spell. The incantation she had received tugged at her soul, urging her to explore its full potential. The land flourished under her compassionate touch, free of darkness and sorrow. Amelia’s instincts told her to utter her spell in a secluded grove, and the words echoed through the dense foliage: “Unite.” Determined to find out more, Amelia sought out ancient libraries and wise sages.",

We walked together in the park, we sat on the couch and watched movies, we met for lunch whenever our schedules allowed. I had never been happier. On our six month anniversary, I asked her to marry me, and to my delight, she said yes. We spent the next year happily planning our wedding, and finally the big day arrived. We were married surrounded by our family and friends. We bought our first home together and began to dream of the children that we would have someday. From that moment on, we were husband and wife, and I knew that our love would only grow stronger with time. But then, just a few months after our wedding, our lives took a tragic turn. She began to have symptoms that the doctors couldn’t explain. After many tests, the devastating diagnosis was made: she had a terminal illness and only months to live. I was heartbroken. We made the most of the time that we had left together, savoring every precious moment. On our first anniversary, she took her last breaths in my arms. The pain of losing her was almost more than I could bear. Though our love will live on in my heart, a part of me died with her that day. I was consumed with grief, and I had only memories and photographs to remind me of our all too brief time together. Our love had begun so brightly, only to end in shadow.",

I wanted him to taste the bitter agony that had become my life. As I prepared his last meal, my hands trembled with rage and grief. With each ingredient I chose, I imagined the anguish I wanted him to feel. I started with a slab of meat, seasoned with salt and a marinade of my daughter’s favorite spices. As the aroma filled the air, I remembered her laughter, and the pain of what had been stolen from me. Then I carefully arranged a plate of roasted vegetables. Each vegetable represented a different aspect of my daughter’s personality. The sweet carrots represented her kindness, the fiery red peppers her passion, the tender asparagus her grace. The bread, a loaf of crusty bread, symbolized her strength. The dough rose steadily, like her resilience in the face of adversity. The bread was filled with a dark chocolate ganache, which represented the bitterness of my sorrow. The final touch was a glass of wine, a rich, full-bodied wine, which symbolized the essence of life, now tainted with the taste of death. As I poured it into the glass, I imagined him swallowing every drop, renouncing his right to life. I finished the meal and silently set it before him. The weight of his crime hung in the air, mingling with the aroma of the food. His eyes widened as he recognized the significance of each carefully chosen ingredient.",

Her smile was like a warm embrace, and her eyes promised the love I had always longed for. But fate had a cruel twist in store for us. With each passing moment, I realized that though I had found the missing piece of my soul, I was not the one they were looking for. Their dreams were different, and they did not include me. In the quiet hours of the night, I struggled with my emotions, torn between the desire to be with them and the knowledge that I could not be the one they needed. Every stolen glance, every tender touch, was a bittersweet reminder of the love that could never be fully reciprocated. The weight of this realization weighed heavily on my shoulders, casting a shadow over the joy we had once shared. The ache in my heart was a constant companion, a dull ache that refused to subside. Days turned into weeks, and the pain grew unbearable. The one who had once been my guiding light was now a torment, a constant reminder of the love that was slipping through my fingers. With a heavy heart, I made the most difficult decision of my life. With trembling hands, I wrote a letter, pouring out my heart and saying goodbye. The words stung like a knife in my soul, but I knew it was the only way to set us both free.",

He rushed to his neighbor’s house and pounded on the door. “Susan, you need to get out now! With the speed the water is rising, many people won’t make it to higher ground in time.” She looked panicked as she realized the gravity of the situation. They had only minutes to evacuate as many people as possible. “The levee broke, the whole town is flooding!” Ted and Susan hurried to help people into boats and cars, but it was a losing battle against nature. Within an hour, the whole downtown was underwater. As the water level kept rising, it became too dangerous to try to evacuate people by boat. Ted saw Mr. Johnson get swept away as he tried to rescue his dog. This was turning into a nightmare. If help didn’t arrive soon, hypothermia and drowning would claim many victims. Ted helped Susan and others climb onto the roof of her house. They watched in horror as cars and buildings disappeared under the murky water. Ted saw a neighbor in a motorboat, trying to rescue as many people as he could. Ted shouted to him to stop and soon they had a dozen more people in the boat. As they were being ferried to higher ground, Ted looked back at the devastation.",

Relief that I was spared the terrifying fate that awaited them, and guilt that I was surviving while others were suffering. The world around me was rapidly transforming into a dystopian nightmare.

The cities were empty, and the infected cyborgs roamed the streets, their bodies a hideous fusion of flesh and machinery. As the days turned into weeks, I searched for answers. Why was I immune? What made me different from the rest? In my search for answers, I stumbled upon a secret underground resistance. They were a small group of scientists and rebels who had devoted themselves to understanding the virus and finding a cure. Among them was Dr. Sophia Reynolds, a brilliant virologist who had been studying the virus since its emergence. She explained that the virus was a kind of infection of nanobots, fusing technology with the human body. I was immune because my immune system had a rare anomaly that prevented the assimilation of the virus. We searched for untouched laboratories and research centers, gathering data and working desperately to find a cure. I joined their cause, driven by a new purpose.",

Unseen forces tugged at our senses, distorting reality and making us question our very existence. The nights grew longer, and fear hung in the air like a heavy fog. We gathered beneath the canopy of trees, seeking comfort in the familiar warmth of our community. The village elder, wise in his years, spoke of ancient legends that foretold such an event—a visitation from the gods, he said. We hastily constructed idols and adorned them with offerings, hoping to appease the unknown forces that had descended upon us. But even here, the supernatural encroached on our safe haven. Whispers of vanished tribes and incurable madness echoed through the trees.",

I panicked when I realized how unprepared I was. If I failed this assignment, I would have to repeat God School 101, and I really didn't want to be the god who was still in the first grade when everyone else had already graduated. All the other gods in my class were well on their way, some were even finishing their final touches, but I hadn't even started. I hurried to the Creation Lab to grab some materials, and luckily there were no other gods there, so I didn't have to see their judging looks as I gathered matter and celestial bodies. I hurriedly flung out stardust and lit up sparkling lights, and my creation took on a haphazard, messy form. Over the next few days, I worked non-stop, barely sleeping or eating ambrosia, rushing to build planets, set physical laws, and seed the first life forms.

She told me she had a gift too: she could see the future. She was understanding and accepting of my gift. One day we were walking in the park when we saw a man sitting on a bench. He was crying and we could feel his pain. We became close friends and we used our gifts to help others. We sat down next to him and asked him what was wrong. He told us he had lost his job and he felt lost and alone. We told him we believed in him and that he would soon find a new job. The man thanked us for our help. We were glad we had been able to help him and we knew we were using our gifts for good. He said we had made him feel better. We continued to use our gifts to help others. We helped people find lost things, we helped people make decisions and we helped people through difficult times. One day we were called to help a woman who was dying. We were happy to help her.

His weary eyes held the wisdom that only time can etch into a person's soul. His gentle smile revealed the weight of countless years lived, etched into the lines of his face. The older version of myself extended a weathered hand to me, his touch surprisingly warm and reassuring against my frozen skin. Words failed me at that moment, but he understood the storm of questions raging in my mind. He nodded silently, as if granting me permission to rest and trust in the journey ahead.

However, the acoustic science in the restaurant is low -cost, enlarging the sound and created a little irritating environment. It is a challenge to hear my dining companion without nervousness. Another aspect that needs to be improved is the cleanliness of the institution. The table was sticky, the floor seemed to be ignored, and the debris was scattered around. It left a slight impression on people, which further promoted my sense of mixing this place.",

Most options represent tired American standards available anywhere. Little imagination went into crafting flavorful combinations or intriguing presentations. Adventurous diners looking for innovative cooking will feel let down. Upon seating, it took over fifteen minutes to receive drink orders, an unacceptable delay. When our server did arrive, she appeared overwhelmed and distracted. She neglected to enter one of our appetizer orders entirely. The kitchen also struggled, as main dishes took over an hour to deliver, an excessive wait.Bland and overcooked best describe most meals served. Even simple dishes like chicken tenders suffered from careless preparation. Sides lacked luster at best, leaving no impression at worst. The sole redeeming feature was a seasonal salad, though not substantial enough to rescue the meal.At the prices charged, customers rightly expect higher quality food and service. Yet this restaurant delivers neither, seeming indifferent to the dining experience. With so many delectable options nearby, little reason exists to waste time or money here. Save your appetite and dollars for one of the numerous superior choices in this vibrant city center. In summary, this establishment offers mediocre fare amid abundant excellent alternatives in uptown Charlotte. Diners hoping for a noteworthy meal would do well to look elsewhere.

During lunch breaks, their phone comes back out while chatting with coworkers. In the evenings, I help entertain them on the commute home by playing a podcast or playlist. Back at home, it's more social media as they unwind from the day. On weekends, I'm used for fun too - whether looking up recipes while cooking dinner or finding hiking trails to explore. Just before bed, they do one last quick scroll through posts before setting me on the nightstand to charge overnight. I'm thankful to be such an integral part of their daily routine. Through relaxing music and staying organized, I aim to make their life a little easier each day.",

Lost in the pages of her book, Sophie became completely engrossed in the story. Time slipped away unnoticed. Before she knew it, hours had passed and the flames had grown noticeably lower. More firewood was needed to feed its hungry appetite.Rising from the sofa, Sophie went to fetch logs from the woodbox beside the fireplace. As she placed fresh wood onto the fading embers, a stray spark jumped and landed on the rug. At first, just a thin wisp of smoke rose but soon, the flames began to spread. Alarmed, Sophie tried to quickly stamp it out but it was too late. The old, dry rug was kindling for the hungry flames. Smoke rapidly filled the room as the fire roared back to ferocious life, this time with a vengeance. Sophie screamed for help as the flames spread rapidly across the floor, licking at the surrounding furniture and walls. Within minutes, the entire living room was ablaze.She rushed to call the fire department but it was too late to save the house. Firefighters arrived but could only watch helplessly as the magnificent fire consumed everything in its path, spreading voraciously from room to room.

This time, however, my experience was particularly noteworthy, so I decided to take a moment to share my thoughts.I visited Harris again last night with a group of friends, and we were in the mood for some delicious Korean BBQ. We arrived around 7 pm, and the restaurant was already bustling with activity. The interior is cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and traditional Korean decor that creates a lively and energetic atmosphere. The smell of sizzling meat and the sound of laughter fill the air, making it easy to get excited about the meal to come.We were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to our table, and our server, Sophia, took our orders and brought us our drinks promptly. The menu at Harris is extensive and varied, with a wide selection of meats, sides, and appetizers to choose from. We ordered a variety of dishes to share, including the famous Harris Combo, which includes a selection of marinated meats and a side of rice.The food at Harris did not disappoint. The meats were all tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of marinade to enhance the flavors without overpowering the meat. The side dishes were also delicious, with a nice balance of spicy and savory flavors.But what really made our experience stand out was the exceptional customer service. Our server, Sophia, was attentive and friendly throughout the meal, making sure that our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed.",

By day, I immersed myself in the life of a student, navigating math problems and surviving lunchroom drama. But when night fell, a wondrous transformation occurred—I became a writer, weaving intricate tales that transported readers to fantastical worlds brimming with aliens, magic, and time travel.Little did anyone suspect that my best-selling novel was, in fact, based on my real-life adventures. The characters sprang from the depths of my friendships, the settings were vibrant landscapes I had explored, and the thrilling plot twists mirrored the obstacles I had overcome.To my astonishment, my English teacher announced that our class would be reading my book. Excitement bubbled within me as I anticipated their reactions to the pages that held my secret. However, as the teacher delved into discussing the story, a disconcerting realization washed over me.He mispronounced the names of the alien races and distorted the descriptions of the magical artifacts. Each interpretation he offered deviated further from the intricate tapestry I had carefully crafted. It was like stumbling upon an alternate tale altogether.Days turned into weeks, and my frustrations grew. The teacher consistently misconstrued crucial plot points and failed to grasp the profound themes underlying my work. It pained me to witness the masterpiece I had birthed being dissected and misunderstood.One day, unable to bear the weight any longer, I summoned the courage to approach the teacher after class. I unveiled my true identity as the author, hopeful that he would share my excitement or, at the very least, gain fresh perspective.",

Stepping outside only added to my confusion - the world seemed strangely different.Cars zoomed by unlike any I had seen before, far more advanced than what was possible in my time. The clothing and technology that everyone possessed appeared straight out of a science fiction film. Perplexed, I stopped someone to politely ask the date. \"Today is January 1st, 3015,\" they replied casually before continuing on their way. My knees buckled as I processed what had been said - how could a full thousand years have passed while I slept? Desperate for answers, I hurried to the library, hoping their archives could provide clarity. Displayed throughout were dates ranging from 2015 to 3015, confirming historical events, scientific discoveries, and presidencies that validated the unbelievable year I now found myself in. Retreating in a daze, my mind raced to comprehend the impossible situation. Nothing made logical sense anymore. The world had transformed entirely while I remained unchanged.People communicated in ways I did not understand, and towering skyscrapers reached heights inconceivable in my era. Cars zoomed overhead on floating roadways. Even nature seemed foreign now. I wandered aimlessly, feeling profoundly out of place and disconnected from both space and time. Nothing felt recognizable in this advanced society that had evolved across centuries without me. How could I possibly adjust or fit into a world that had progressed so far beyond my own limited timeframe?",

King Theodore received mounting reports of the trouble with concern. Who would undermine the hard-won peace? He dispatched his best spies and soldiers to investigate, but the conspirators seemed to vanish without trace after each action.Weeks passed as unrest rose again between Eldin and its neighbors. In desperation, Alban's group kidnapped the daughter of a powerful lord long supportive of peace, hoping her ransom would force preparation for war. However, their plan backfired when the king's men tracked the girl to the conspirators' mountain hideout.",

I shook my head, trying to clear the cobwebs.As I made my way to the kitchen, I noticed that the floor was covered in wine. I mean, completely covered. It was like a sea of red liquid. I thought to myself, \"This is odd. Did I spill some wine last night?\" But as I looked closer, I saw that it wasn't just the floor. The walls, the furniture, everything was covered in wine. I was confused and a bit scared. I walked to the fridge and opened it, hoping to find some water to hydrate myself. But instead of water, I found more wine. I was starting to feel like I was in some kind of weird dream.I walked to the living room and saw that the TV was on. The news was reporting on a strange phenomenon that had occurred overnight. The anchors were talking about how the world's oceans had mysteriously turned into wine. My jaw dropped as I realized what had happened. In my blackout, I had somehow turned the world's oceans into wine.",

Although the produce section had a decent size, it lacked the freshness and selection one would expect from a traditional supermarket. The emphasis seemed to be placed on pre-packaged fruits and vegetables, rather than the vibrant, locally sourced options I had anticipated.Navigating through the store proved to be quite challenging, as the signage was both confusing and inadequate. Locating specific items became a daunting task, resulting in multiple backtracks in search of basic household essentials. The lack of organization within the aisles only added to the frustration, with similar products scattered haphazardly throughout different sections.The checkout process proved to be another letdown. Despite having numerous lanes available, only a few were operational, leading to long queues and waiting times. The staff appeared overwhelmed and understaffed, struggling to keep up with the influx of customers. These shortcomings further dampened the overall shopping experience, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.The selection of products on offer also fell short of expectations. While the store did carry well-known brands, the options within each category were severely limited, leaving little room for exploration and experimentation. It felt as if the stock was tailored primarily for convenience rather than catering to a diverse range of tastes and preferences.However, I must admit that the deli section stood out as one of the few redeeming factors.",

I love the thrill of the hunt, scouring through racks of clothes and tablets of dwelling goods to find that one special piece that catches my eye. And when I finally find something I love, there's a sense of 𝚝riumph that comes with knowing I got an impressive deal. I've been frequenting consignment shops for years now, and I'e found some truly incredible items. I've scoreԁ designer purses, barely-worn shoes, and even vintage clothіng that looks like it came straight out of a fashion magazine. And the best part is, I've never had to break the baոk to get my manos on these amazing finds. In addition to the great prices, I also love the durability aspect of consignment shopping. I𝚝's a way to recycle perfectly good items and give them a new life, rather than letting them sit in a land𝚏ill. Plus, it's a great way to support local businesses and contribute to my ϲommunity. Another benefit of consignmen𝚝 shopping is the chance to connect with other people who share my interests. Con signment shops often host events and sales, which give me the opportunity to meet other shoppers and chat about our shared love of second-hand riches. It's a fun and social way to shop, and it's allowed me to form some lasting friendships over the ye ars. All in all, I can't recоmmend consignment shopping enough. It's a budget-friendly, sustainable, and sociable way to find unique things that truly stand out.",
