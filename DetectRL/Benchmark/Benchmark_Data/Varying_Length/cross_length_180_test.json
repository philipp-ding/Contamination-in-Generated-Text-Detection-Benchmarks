We were visiting from out of town and browsing the down town scene and what a scene this place was.

Not little people but just short people. Oh yeah and the swing in the corner. nnWell I had a blast. The music was great and the vibe was great. There were quite a few young people and about 3 men who I thought might have been in their 60's but that was ok because it was cool. It was judgment free. The headless bull in the corner was cool too. The girls dancing on the bar were cool too.",

Collision strengths in LS-coupling werecalculated in the close coupling approximation with the R-matrix method. Then,fine structure collision strengths were obtained by means of theintermediate-coupling frame transformation (ICFT) method which accounts forspin-orbit coupling effects. We present extensive comparisons with the mostrecent calculations and measurements for Ca II as well as a comparison betweenthe core polarization results and the \"unpolarized\" values. We find that corepolarization affects the computed lifetimes by up to 20%. Our results are invery close agreement with recent measurements for the lifetimes of metastablelevels.

The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of thesection bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalizedgradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents ahigher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a fewcomponents (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressedin terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independentjets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of thesejets. The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, morespecifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, thiswork has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdeterminedsystems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through anapplication of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators offirst and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplaceoperator.",

Moreover, when the parameter is not too large,they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros areall simple, and they \"repel\". The structure of these functions makes the reasonfor the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests amechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of thezeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functionsin the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even forsmall values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to themas the parameter increases.

Astatistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p values in thissample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3-sigmalevel or greater, which has significant implications for particle accelerationmodels. This approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburstdensity structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous)and k=2 (wind-like).

Theconvergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We alsoinvestigate the piston system when the particle interactions have beensmoothed.

Bolognese was solid though lacked mushrooms and my husband's dish was tasty too though the hot sausage was bland, it needed salt. Portions are huge, mine was easily two meals. Italian bread or rolls (not warmed up) w/ butter balls comes with the meal and there is EVOO on the table.

Aside from the dessert, the meal was reasonably priced. nnService was consistent with other Yelpers' reviews - really, really friendly. We liked our waitress. Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit.",

Therefore, comparisons are natural. nnI found the soup salty. The salad dressing was okay, but missing something. Rice was good, noodles had a nice garlic flavor and veggies were standard. I ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor. Had the sauce not been visible I would have sworn I got the wrong item. The meat itself did not taste good. It wasn't spoiled tasting, more like a really cheap cut of meat. I only ate about three bites. In another environment I would have gone so far as to complain, but not here. The shrimp were good. Maybe most disappointing was the ubitiqous white shrimp sauce. It was very watery and bland: (. Major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit!",

Its masters were unsure, but open to alternatives after early losses to Earth's defenses. In thanks, the alien granted Jenna one wish. She thought of the all-knowing narrator who had chronicled humanity's tragic fall. With her wish, she freed the narrator from her lonely duty, granting her the life and love denied for so long. The two stood together, hoping this small act of mercy could pave the way for understanding between formerly warring peoples.",

The MIPS instrument has four bands centered at 24, 70, 160, and 240 microns. Here, we describe the calibration and characterization of the 70 micron band, which is particularly useful for studying the dust emission in galaxies and the formation of stars.The 70 micron band was calibrated using a combination of laboratory measurements and observations of celestial targets. The laboratory measurements were performed on a set of reference samples with known reflectance spectra, while the celestial targets included asteroids, planets, and stars with well-known brightness.The calibration process involved correcting for detector non-linearity, flat-fielding, and flux conversion. The non-linearity correction was done using a third-order polynomial fit to the reference samples, while the flat-fielding correction was performed using a median filter to remove any spatial variations in the detector response.The flux conversion was done using a set of standard stars with known brightness at 70 microns.",

Notably, we gain a thorough topological understanding of the leaves surrounding center-type components within the singular set and the topology of their basins.Exploiting the stability theorem, we delve into the topology of basin boundaries and elucidate the transformations occurring in leaf topology when transitioning from inside to outside the basins. Our analysis employs fiberwise Milnor-Wallace surgery as a crucial technique, which necessitates demonstrating the presence of a saddle if the boundary of a center's basin is non-empty. We introduce the concept of pairing between centers and saddles, and in three dimensions, we outline the potential pairings that can arise. Employing a novel method called foliated surgery, inspired by the classical saddle-node bifurcation, we effectively reduce certain singularity pairings in a foliation.By leveraging our previous research in this area, we extend Reeb's sphere recognition theorem to 3-manifolds. This extension facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and topological properties of smooth foliations with Morse singularities.",

Surely the great lands of Middle-earth would not fear a ring of mall dominance. He needed a realm of darkness, not department stores.His new design was ready. This time, the Black Speech promised only death. Satisfied, Sauron left to continue his plans for domination. But everywhere he went, whispers followed of \"The Ring of the Mall\". Even orcs now mocked the name. Sauron's anger grew with each jest. Gandalf learned of the error and saw an opportunity. He spread word far and wide that Sauron's ambition was consumerism, not conquest. Across the lands, the \"Mall Ring\" became a legend of ridiculous failure. None took Sauron seriously anymore. His fearsome image was ruined.Realizing his mistake, Sauron returned to the dwarf. But it was too late - the name had stuck. All now knew him as the \"Lord of the Malls\".",

I shivered at the thought of being alone in such a place.The second image was of a dilapidated mansion, the windows boarded up and the doors hanging off their hinges. The paint was peeling and faded, and the once-grand staircase was now crumbling and decrepit.

From traditional Italian dishes to modern fusion creations, there was some𝚝hing for everyone. Wе started off with some appetizers, including the bruschetta and the fried calamari, both of which were delicious and served in generous porions. For the main coursе, I decided to try their signature pasta dish, the spaghe𝚝ti carbonara, which was cooked to perfection. The combination of creamy sauce, crispy pancetta, and al dente pasting was heavenly. My friend opted for the seafood risotto, and she couldn't stop raving about how flavorful and riche it was. Throuɡhout the evening, the staff at Pino's provided impeccable service. Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable, suggesting the peⲅfect wine pairing for our meals. The restaurant had a lively ambiance, with a live band replay soothing jazz music in the backgⲅound, adding to the overall charm of the place.

On senior of that, the tuxedo they provided was dirty and had noticeable stains. It was as if they hadn't bthered to clean it before renting it out. When I pointed out the issue, they seemed indifferent and didn't offer any solution or apologies. To make matters worse, the tuxedo started dwindling apart during the event. The buttons were loo se, and the seams were coming undone. It was embarrassing and ruined the entire evеning for me. I never expectеd a rental service to provide such low-quality garments. Du pricing was also exorbitant for the poor quality they delivered. I could have rented a much better tuxedo from a different place at a loԝer price. It's clear that this rental serviϲe is taking advantage of customers by charging high rates for subpar products. The customer service was also abysmal. When I callеd to express my dissatisfaction and request a refund, I was met with rude and unhelpful representatives.",

By combining the infrared spectral energy distrіbutions (SEDs) with optical and X-ray observations, we estіmate the dust covering factor, which quantifies the fraction of the central engiոe obscured by dust. Our analysis reveals a wide range of dust covering factors in QSOs, suggesting a diverse population of obscuration pr operties in these objects. Furthermore, we examie the silicate emission features in the infrared SEDs, which provide important insights into the properties of the sandstorm grains. We find that QSOs exhibit a variety of siliϲate emission strengths, with some objects showing prominent dust emission and otherwise displaying weak or even absent silicate features. This variations indicate differences in the grain size distribution and composition within the dusty regions surrounding QSO nuclei. To underѕtand the connection between dust properties and star formation, we compare our results with measurements of QSO host galaxy properties, such as stellaⲅ mass and star formation rate.",
