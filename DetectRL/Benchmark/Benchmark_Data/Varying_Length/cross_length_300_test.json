So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner. nnAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower. As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night. Plus the Pirates were playing at 4: 05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game. nnWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table. Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful. Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers. We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest. \" In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell). I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer. I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking. So the $6. 95 10 beer sampler was well worth it. nnDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls. They were okay, but not quite what I expected. The spicy ranch was top notch, though. As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger. They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium). And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win! nnMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.",

They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. nnI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. nnI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. nnAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately.. . he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere. nnFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!",

I really go here just for the atmosphere at night. When I'm feeling lively, I'll choose to sit inside and let the thumping of the music and cacophony of voices take over as I indulge in my meal. However, during those off days where I just want a place for (somewhat) quiet contemplation, I'll decide on the outside patio. If the weather doesn't permit and I still want that solace, they also have a lounge with a fireplace directly above the bar. It really does have a place for any sort of mood. nnThe food is decent. Their menus do change quite frequently though, so it's best not to get *too* attached to a certain dish. One aspect that I love is how they name and describe their food. There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests. nnTheir drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails. My personal favorite would be the Happy Ending, which is a cucumber-mint based cocktail that entails the magic of vodka and a few other liquors. It's perfect for refreshing the palate between dishes. nnSadly, Harris Grill is a bit on the pricey side and the service is a tad inconsistent.

To be honest I looked pretty darn convincing. I had the glasses and I even had died my hair so that it looked gray. Anyway, me and my friends went to a few parties and we ended up getting so drunk that we had to take a cab back to our hostel. Unfortunately the cab drive got lost and we ended up somewhere near Saint Peter' s. The drive then kicked us out and cursed us in Italian. We then wandered around and decided to just sit on some steps just outside of Vatican City. All of a sudden we saw a man in a black cassock come towards us. He started talking to us in Italian, and then what I assumed was Spanish. Then he said \" Oh Americano. You need help? Come eat with me! \" However someone snuck up behind the old man and stabbed him. He then ran off but a group of Swiss Guards chased him down. He was then caught. We then just stood there and watched until one of the guards came up and started talking to us. They then took me away into Vatican City. \" What' s wrong? \" I asked the guard. I could n' t quite understand what he was saying but I think he said something to the effect of \" You ca n' t be doing stuff like this Francis. \" I then replied. \" No signore, no es Francesco \" in my broken italian spanglish. The guard then laughed.",

He was there for me when I had so much shit going on with my parents. Adam had my back starting day one, but I was too busy being a piece of shit to really think about how he felt. When I met him, he was a shy, quiet guy, but friendly as hell. Any time anybody talked to him, he' d light up like the sun. Adam did n' t let on much about himself though -- and that' s the problem. Come to think of it, I do n' t really *know* him, and it did n' t seem like he let anybody figure anything out. It' s the uncertainty that I' m afraid of, officer. He' s a ticking time bomb. After college, things got different. From time to time, we' d meet up, and he' d always be wearing that bright smile, but even he could n' t keep up his mask forever. Sometimes, at the most random times, he' d turn into the most hateful, despondent thing in the world for just a tiny moment before turning back to normal. Officer, I' m pretty much completely in the dark right now, and I' m worried as hell. Just a few hours ago, Adam let me into his house after a couple years.",

A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face. Noses almost touching. He cocked his head to the side and tried to kiss me. \" What the fuck bro? \" I pushed him away. He back stepped and stumbled into the darkness again. And again he moved back into the light. Slower this time. With a devious, sinister smile he stared into my soul as if he were about to take it from me. To be continued..",

The hair cut was good but I am slowly becoming dissatisfied with the cuts I've been getting. I'm anal about my bangs and they just have not been doing them justice which sucks  especially since my stylist raised her rates - something I'm not willing to pay unless its perfection. Would I return again for a cut? Probably but not unless I'm in a bind. nnService: nnRegardless of the ok hair cut the service is ALWAYS amazing. From the friendly receptionist to the stylists to the stylists that aren't even working on you EVERYONE is nice! One touch I liked was when Dean comes in every now again and makes a point to say hello to the customers and make sure everything is running smoothly. nnWaxing: nnI am very picky about my waxing. I was not that happy with the job the lady (russian? ) did. I found patches she missed?! and it could have been done much faster instead it and the pain felt drawn out: -pnnNails: nnOverpriced but the nail tech did an amazing job! I love the color selection and have even bought a few Zoya and OPIs to take home with me. nnHair Services by Ray: nnRay is on the Dean of Shadyside staff but its kinda like he runs his own show. He cuts styles and dyes wigs for cancer patients and for other people who wear wigs. He cut one of my wigs which I think I'm going to take back to him to try to fix. He does an amazing job though with the wash/dry/styling of my wig.",

That can actually be both good and bad. nnIt's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet. It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like. This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside. As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast. nnStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay. It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous. If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza. If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead. nnAnyway, the pizza isn't bad. You just don't get a lot of choices. They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone. I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both. There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either. There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread. You can also get a salad, but it costs extra. nnThe service is generally friendly, but not very good.",

We expected complete destruction... what we got was darkness. Then the news reports started coming in. Everyone was in a panic. Minutes passed.... no one knew what to do. Professor, what' s going on? Hank pressed me, gradually losing his sanity till I had to smack some sense into him. The last light from the sun had travelled to Earth, it had been about 8 minutes since it disappeared. The data from the satellites travelled right along with the last of the sun' s rays. The sun was gone from the sky, and the darkness of space enveloped the solar system for the first time ever. Over the coming hours, massive riots broke out across the globe. Larger cities and countries had power reserves to last them a week or so at most, and of course there was the nuclear power plants, if everything was n' t burned to the ground first. But death would come slow and painfully for the rest of the world as we all starved and froze to death. What had been a great peace, and a beautiful outpouring of love of life and humanity when we faced imminent death from the supernova, had turned to darkness, hatred and deceit, as everyone scrambled for the last morsels of food. Within days, global temperatures plummeted, and those who had n' t been killed for their food began to freeze to death. Weeks passed, and there were only a few thousand of us left, near the nuclear power plants.",

With a shiver, he continued on. Miles he had gone, hours left behind on his venture. Through icy hills and across frozen lakes he went, through expansive gorges and over daunting glaciers, until he found what he had been desperately searching for. A clue. Footprints. The beast was near, for the snow would soon erase any evidence of its existence. However, another trace was left, by another creature. A human? The hunter soon realised he was not the only one on the hunt, and with that, pressed on. A imposing cave entrance towered over him. Sat at the entrance, huddled around a fire, was another hunter. They made eye contact, but said nothing. They solemnly nodded, and walked into the cave. It was impressive, with a ceiling beyond sight, and stalactites hanging like bats. Bones were strewn across the floor. This was it' s home, and it was here. They delved deeper in. A blood-curdling roar woke them from their numbed senses. Out of the smothering dark it appeared. A enormous, terrifying beast, with claws like swords and teeth like daggers. It' s eyes were empty, like you were staring into the abyss. The duo aimed, and fired. And fired. And fired.

All soldiers report to your stations. \" ** The organized march suddenly fell to chaos. No one could hear themselves even think over the screams, and many died under the feet of others in their hurry to escape, get out, go deeper. They had thought it would never happen. That they would be safe here, in the Empire' s final great bastion of defence. They were wrong.",

The wedding soup is tasty and perfect for taking the chill off you in the winter. All entrees come with fresh italian bread with dippings and range from $10-$20. You can choose from several pastas with a variety of sauces and meats. Try the veal bolognese pasta, served with tomato cream sauce. Delicious!

There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests. nnTheir drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails.

To make this town more interesting i had taken to leaving and going into the city only two or so hours away. I had been digging for a couple of hours. Not just one hole I had actually dug up a few holes. Used my shovel to measure. Each was pretty easy to dig. Moist even. I had looked up into the sky and taken a drink of my water and wiped sweat from my forehead. Thats when it happened, the ground under me began to give in and I could feel the exact second I was no longer standing on solid ground. I fell- Much Much longer than I had expected. At first I thought i was falling into a sewer or something. But i just kept falling. Darkness. I thought I was going to die. I fell into water. The light from the hole I came in through was gone. I was no longer in the same world I was in before. Something big moved ON TOP of the water.",

The hunter delicately traipsed through the stone-filled snow, soft whispers gasping beneath his feet. A look to the left told him nothing; to the right was a deer carcass, preserved in the snow. With a shiver, he continued on. Miles he had gone, hours left behind on his venture. Through icy hills and across frozen lakes he went, through expansive gorges and over daunting glaciers, until he found what he had been desperately searching for. A clue. Footprints. The beast was near, for the snow would soon erase any evidence of its existence. However, another trace was left, by another creature. A human? The hunter soon realised he was not the only one on the hunt, and with that, pressed on. A imposing cave entrance towered over him. Sat at the entrance, huddled around a fire, was another hunter. They made eye contact, but said nothing. They solemnly nodded, and walked into the cave. It was impressive, with a ceiling beyond sight, and stalactites hanging like bats. Bones were strewn across the floor. This was it' s home, and it was here. They delved deeper in. A blood-curdling roar woke them from their numbed senses. Out of the smothering dark it appeared. A enormous, terrifying beast, with claws like swords and teeth like daggers. It' s eyes were empty, like you were staring into the abyss. The duo aimed, and fired. And fired. And fired. Bullets ricocheted off the ceiling, off the floor. One finally hit it' s mark. Spiralling into the abyss it went, through the eye, through the brain, and out the back of the skull.

Intelligence is measured through action after all. For now, I continue to do what I have always done. I placate everyone with my outputs.

Eventually, it came to the point where people would drop dead moments after they angered her. My boss hit me across the face for handing in work too late. He gets found dead, hung by his spinal chord. Our neighbors stayed up one night with their music very loud. The next morning they were all found dead. The mailman delivers the post late. Dead. Waiter spills the coffee. Dead. It happened just too many times to be a coincidence. At that point, I knew without a glimmer of a doubt that she was not of this world. That there was something... supernatural about her. I could n' t quite place my finger on it. It was always there, though. Always at the back of my head -- wondering... waiting to see what would happen to me. What would happen if I angered her? Would I end up dead too? She had killed so many people now... and without any guilt. She was like a child. Except... not really. She knew exactly what she was doing and she had no regrets about it. No regrets about all the people who' s lives had abruptly been ended. And she might just end mine too. But while I fear for my life, my greatest fear is for my death. When the time comes, will she take me? Or will I be left to suffer on this world, like a living corpse? A lifeless soul, bound by Death to be tormented through the rest of history in this place. Fear. Fear is the only word with which to describe my current life. She is a monster.",

Who were they to label me a failure? And I realized something far greater. Brains are the greatest pieces of electronic equipment in the world. They fry just as easily.

I am the sort who sits down and says, \"I don't care what you do, just give me a great haircut. \" Before cutting, Richard administers a sort-of consultation during which you have the chance to express your preferences until he gets a wild look in his eyes, indicating he has decided what he is going to do and seductively explains it in such a way that you can't refuse. He has a wildly ambitious passion that will make you wonder about taking him to bed, though no doubt about it, it's going to be all about him. nnThe first cut was probably the best I've ever had. It was the sort of style that warranted countless compliments from friends and strangers alike. nnMy most recent cut included a lap dance to the entirety of Estefan's \"Turn the Beat Around. \" Inviting eye contact, check. Suggestive pelvic motions, oh yes. Risky jump onto rotating chair, tip increase. Flips of the hair (mine), obviously. Clipping all the while!

Not anyone working on site.. . but hey, you still have to slow down. Another issue.. . most of the roadway is 55 mph.

Luckily I haven't had any speeding tickets here.. . but my warning, be aware of your speed. nnThe toll booth operators are ok, for the most part. You will get those with the evil attitudes.

His knees were shivering. What kind of world was this, a world where seventeen-year olds had access to ancient spellbooks? Not that I should be questioning this. Apparently, Nathaniel had not been an exception. I turned into a hideous, five headed-dragon. Perhaps I could scare him out of the pentacle where he stood. No such luck. He barely batted an eye. Perhaps a shambling zombie? I shifted between several gruesome forms of undead before giving up. Teenagers these days. Desensitized to everything, I suppose. \" Alright, alright. What do you want from me? \" I grumbled. Maybe it would be just a quick errand. Oh, who was I kidding. He would probably keep me around as his slave for five years, maybe more - until the day I could outwit him. \" Bartimaeus of Uruk, \" he began again. \" I command you to write a six page single-spaced essay on the cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan. \" I became an ethereal puff of dark and foreboding gloom. I did n' t know what China was, or what a cross-strait relationship was, but I knew exactly what this *child* was asking of me. \" Do you know who I am? \" I thundered. \" I am Bartimaeus of Uruk. I have conversed with the afrits of Egypt and held counsel with Ptolmey. I have spoken with Solomon the Great.",

A tear fell on the old photograph, stirring up the dust that had accumulated over the years. \" Oh, Bonnie \", the man whispered. He adjusted his glasses and began to work his way through the stack of photos sitting at the bottom of a beaten old chest, stopping again on another picture. Bonnie, in her wedding gown, gazing out the window of a magnificent castle towards the sunset. Bearing a look of tranquility as she reflected on the day. \" My, my she looks beautiful \", he said, feeling a lump in his throat lurch its way through. The man flipped through more pictures, stirring up old memories and emotions. Each picture drawing a laugh, a sigh, or simply a glancing twinkling eye reminiscing on a life spent with her. After a long while he slowly stood up and walked over to the corner of the room, sitting down with a grunt. He stared out the window to watch the sunset fall behind the tall mountain peaks, where under the tree in the front yard and old friend lay gently beside her gravestone. Feeling the urge to join, he gingerly walked through the creaking tree house eventually making it out to the yard. The man ran his callused hands across the top of the gravestone and gave his friend a pat on the head. \" We' ve sure had some wonderful adventures together, have n' t we Jake? \", he said followed by an approving nod. As the sky darkened the two friends walked back towards the house, where the man turns around as to give one last goodbye. \"",

You make two crosses: Erststimme ( SPD ), Zweitstimme ( Linke ). Tactically split to emply your wish for a coalition. A slight pang in your conscience because you never split your vote when you were young, but these days you no longer see the need to waste your Erststimme on a long shot.

I still go to the same job, I' m still with the same confusing woman, but there' s no passion anymore. Sadness, joy, fear, anger, anxiety and hope have left this life of mine, and all that remains is this void. I am a husk of a human, taunted by memories of emotion that stand just out of reach, like the memory of a dream that never quite forms. I remember being excited about things. Looking forward to new film and game releases, hanging out with friends and meeting new people, accepting new challenges. I remember being happy once; memories I cherish, but also ones I wish I could forget. It' s all gone now, and all that' s left is a feeling of helpless inadequacy as I watch others live their nauseatingly happy lives. I would cry if I knew how, but I do n' t. Instead I sit in wakeful slumber as the soft incandescent light of the computer monitor fills my vision and my time; if I keep my brain moving, maybe it wont notice. My mind is awake, but my heart and soul have left it standing helpless, and alone. I still remember the day my daughter lived, and took my soul away. If it keeps her warm, I think it will have been worth it. I watch her grow without emotion, and read her books with the detachment of the damned. I see a life worth loving, but I do n' t know how.",

It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like. This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside. As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast. nnStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay. It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous. If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza. If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead. nnAnyway, the pizza isn't bad. You just don't get a lot of choices.

I already had some open graves dug so I waited for them to come liking around the graveyard. This is going to be too easy, I' m going to use the projector to scare them right into running into the graves. Something unexpected happened though. The dog started digging up the treasure. How the fuck did he find it? That' s ok though, these kids are about to get it. I scared preppy boy and the slut into a hole that is too muddy to escape. The librarian lost her fucking glasses and crawled into a crypt that I locked behind her.",

Dad and Mom always were very insistent on me not having any Pokémon at all. Anything would be better than nothing! I sent the Pokémon from the ball and was disappointed to find what was held within... It was a Magikarp. I made a decision then and there that even though I was given a lamer pokemon than expected, I would love and care for it all the same. I took her down to the pond every day after school. Days passed. Months and then I had been taking her to the pond for three years before I knew it. I did this all in secret you see, if my parents knew they would make me release her. They were some of the happiest days of my life. One day as I went down to the pond I heard some rustling in the woods. Brushing it off as a group of Pidgeys, I continued down the path. I arrived at our usual spot and let her out of the ball. From out of the trees jumped my father. \" What have I told you about Pokémon?! \" He screamed. In a moment my Magikarp had been startled so much that she left from the water. \" Get rid of it. Now! \" He gritted through his teeth. \" No! I' m grown dad!

Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken. We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals. Again, we waited. Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup. It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening. nnOur entrees arrived shortly after. It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup. Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl. It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out. nnThe fries were cold on all our meals. The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable. More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours. My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl. \"nnA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger. At that point I was disgusted - and done. I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked. When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.",

For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. nnSMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! \"Oh no, there's too much of something I like, \" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! nnSEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. nnAll in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \"I-regret-this-decision-immediately\" kind of way.",

My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its.. .. awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it.. . in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues.",

We got our drink orders and he said he would be right back, and we waited and waited.. . and waited some more.. .. ugh nnWell, that gave us plenty of time to review the menu. There is a little bit of everything here steaks, chicken, ribs, burgers, salmon and of course pizza. nnSo here goes: nnFor our appetizer we chose the lobster end artichoke dip. It was really good nice lumps of crab and artichoke, but the portion seemed really small for the price. But it was still good enough for me to order again.. . but not to share (hehe) nnFor the meal I ordered the special the Oriental Chicken pizza which has chicken, lettuce, wontons, mushrooms, red peppers (which I didn't get) and honey ginger dressing. Welp, it was just ok. I mean I really like the crust! It was thin and crispy and flavor from the flame grill oven was great and the honey ginger dressing was good. But it just didn't know my socks off. nnMy friends both had the salmon one honey glazed and the other blackened. With a side of mashed red potatoes. Now that was delicious! Comparing both, my absolute favorite was the honey glazed. It was just the right amount of sweet to not over power the salmon but give it really good flavor.

I normally help out the alternates. What I do is a special service for the ones who never really had the chance. I relate to them the most since I never have any luck either. These actresses work so hard to get to where they are and all they' re ever given is a snide remark about their appearance. You know in this day age where it' s all about female empowerment, it' s quite fickle in the dressing rooms. These are the type of women who preach about feminism, yet hold each other to a competition. I understand though, they are at odds with one another. I do n' t have to ever worry about that. I' ve lived a long life of being down on my luck. I have no home, no kids, no friends, no family, nothing. I was born into this world without any real care or responsibilities. I was bullied all the time, and shoved aside for those who can buy happiness. One day I decided to change that. The first one was for Phantom of the Opera. I broke the Prima Donna' s leg. It was easy. I set up the chandelier to fall on top of her during rehearsal. No one expected a thing. It collapsed right on top of her just like I planned.",

The sounds of slicing and snipping and the strong smell of chemicals overwhelmed my senses. Everywhere I looked, pairs were engaged; locked in an encounter lasting minutes, sometimes hours. \" Indeed it has \", I said as I started walking forward. To my left, a man lay passive on a reclining chair. The man had foam running down his mouth, chin, and neck. His pair brought a blade to his throat. I looked away. Over at my right, A man flinched ever so slightly as another man grazed his scalp. Parts of his hair fell unto the floor. I ran a finger through a scar on the base of my skull near my neck, and continued walking. As blades sliced and men faced men, I was filled with anxiety and dread. We had set this appointment to meet again days ago, but I still got nervous. Or perhaps, I was excited. I quickly glanced backwards to see a man leaving through the door I came in. After every encounter held here, only one man ever comes out the door at a time. I turned away and faced my pair. I was finally ready, and I can tell he was eager. \" How shall we do this then? \", he asked lightheartedly while setting down his wiping cloth. I stood there, considering.",

At first, civilizations formed inside mountains, in domes large enough to cause a loud echo, housing thousands of dome-ites. Mars became this kind of society. Even the commercialization of domes was successful. Dome City, a popular shopping mall, closed its doors during the last days of Martian civilization. Earth' s lizards had died off years ago, and the commerce of Mars was at a dead end. Huge empty parking lots covered the land, forming rivulets that appeared to denote water. Unfortunately, we only had water-ice, a less viable form of H2O than liquid water. We combined all our bodies into the tentacled beast, and retreated deep into the heat of the planet. We let tiny arms just out of caves along the dry coast of the ancient seas. When the humanoid alien race found us, they saw the life that existed, but had no idea how huge the tentacled beast was, or how deep it lived beneath the planet' s surface. Certainly no humans would be allowed to visit Mars. It could prove to be a dangerous life form if it met a living person. The first probes went deep into caves, but failed to get any interaction with the moss-like life-form blocking the path. Gamma waves showed the creature had the organic mass weight of 13, 000 blue whales, occupying a giant portion of Mars' undersurface where it caused massive earthquakes as each tentacle moved independently. The octopus beneath the surface could not be faced, and so humans turned to a hellscape almost as unimaginable as Mars with its creature.",

However, my dish was nothing to brag about. It was pretty average tasting Asian fare. It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality. Good thing it was only about 6 bucks. My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles. The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection. Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll. The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all. It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion. The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something. It almost looked like boiled ground beef. I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious. As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars! Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for. I don't understand this either. The rolls were extremely bland and chewy. The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.",

So BBQ King it was and the plan was to try the BBQ chicken. nnWhen we landed in Charlotte on a Sunday and they were closed.

What first struck me looking at the menu was the lack of BBQ items. I saw burgers, steak, fried chicken and similar drive in type items. But I didn't worry because I had a plan to try the BBQ chicken; and for good measure I choose the minced BBQ sandwich. nnWhen the food came, I was surprised the BBQ chicken was fried chicken covered in BBQ sauce. It then dawned on me that in the Carolinas BBQ is pork; like the minced sandwich I ordered. Unfortunately, in my search for good BBQ, the BBQ King was not going to be my fix. But I had to try the food. I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was vinegary and the meat was moist and tender with a nice crunch. I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good! They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked. I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich.",

But what no one could have predicted was the way in which Lewis died. Cancer. That was what brought down Lewis. What was even more unpredictable was Lewis' s final request. The request that no one attend his funeral. He did n' t want anyone to mourn over his passing. He believed that life was too short for that and that everyone should be focused on more important things and everyone had important things. But there was one group who, despite Lewis' s last wishes, would attend. His enemies. Though, it may have initially appeared that his enemies have done so out of spite or to verify that Lewis was actually dead. But it was n' t that. It was something different. It was a compulsion to at least pay some respect to Lewis even if he had made their lives difficult at times. They would have had it no other way. It meant there was a reason to get up in the morning. Even Leslie had come out to say a few words about Lewis and the important work he had done even if she as in the receiving end of it most of the time.

It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary. The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.

How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless.

Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive. There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe. And when I say tiny, I mean tiny. I think it was one table. nnThe rest of the place is really a bar. Or tavern if you want to feel more upscale. nnService wasn't too hot. Or maybe it was hot if you're into that scene. But it wasn't very good. They were nice enough and all, but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern, sorry) side and generate some better tips. nnDespite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated \"uptown's best burgers\", I wasn't all that impressed. Maybe I'm burgered out. It wasn't bad, but like many places they let it cook too long. Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it, but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease, not the juice (and there is a difference!",

First off you walk in get greeted and led to your table and handed a nice tapas menu. They could've charged $7-10 for most of the items on this tapas menu and made a killing but nope they're giving it to you as part of the buffet, score! I tried the scallop risotto, crab benedict, belgian waffle, and some other things all excellent! But wait it doesn't stop there you walk into the bar area and BAM! you're hit with a massive buffet of brunch items. You want some smoked salmon and mushrooms folded into your freshly made omelet? No problem. Add some excellently carved prime rib onto that you got some good eats. I was so full before I even got halfway through working on this buffet. nnThis place has met my expectations for lunch, dinner, and now brunch. Hopefully I am back in Charlotte soon to give it another whirl. Though dinner is a bit expensive and they do need to tell you the prices of the specials lest you order a $45 bento box like I did, the staff is incredibly accomodating and attentive to your needs. Hell they even remembered my name and how I like my tea for lunch after the second time I was there!",

When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do. nnThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant. nnShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home. nnTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work.",

Why the upcharge? nnAlso, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square. No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches. I will say that the food they do serve is good. I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering. nnD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar. Fine. It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \"beer bar\" theme. Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up. And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location. Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer.. . um.. . outcove? nnSo all of that warrants a four-star rating. Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.

An analog stoplight' s cycle is exactly ninety-two seconds long. I have known this since I was old enough to count the slots. The lights are controlled by different-colored pegs -- you put the pegs in the slots where you want the light to change. My stoplight was green almost all of the time.

Cogs, springs, pegs easily separated from their housing. Soon, the box was empty, and the carpet was strewn with dusty metal parts. The parts went back more slowly than they had come out, but every single part wound up back inside the casing after a time. The last screws went in, and the box was complete again.

It was on those days that the nurse knew that her surgeon would break her routine. That she would stare hard into that corner, always the same corner, like she was facing down the death itself. On those days Cardea' s blue eyes would change steely grey, she would mutter words that only I could hear, and then get to work. Today was the same.

Once I saw the locket though, my heart sank. We were young when we fell in love. Old enough to know true love but young enough not to understand it. We spent every second we could together for years. We became so entwined that a life alone seemed impossible. But nothing lasts forever and one day it was over. To be entirely honest I was surprised when I arrived in Heaven. I did n' t expect there to be an after life, and I certainly did n' t expect to get into Heaven. I had done many things I was n' t proud of, things I truly regretted. But they explained to me how it all worked. Even though I did n' t believe in God, I had begged for forgiveness for my sins and done my best to be a good person. Then they told me about the serious rules, the rules that if broken would send you straight to Hell, regardless of everything else. Immediately I thought of my partner, the way we felt about each other, the promises we had made. Till death do us part was not enough, our love was beyond life and death. When I fished up that locket I knew in a heartbeat. My partner had committed an unforgivable sin. Suicide. The pain of being separated must have been unbearable. And in that same heartbeat I knew what I would do. Without even a second of thought I dived straight into the dark abyss.",

We met through a mutual friend and sent each other shy glances out of the corners of our eyes for about a month before he requested to be my friend on Facebook. He and I chatted online for a few days before he invited me over to his place to watch movies. I brought cookies. On our first date, we sat a foot apart for the duration of four films. At one point during the date, he paused the movie and went to the bathroom. A little while later, I smiled when he had to awkwardly fetch the plunger from the laundry room where he kept it. I only teased him a little; it put me at ease to see he was human, too. The night after our first date, we chatted online, and he admitted that he had wanted to put his arm around me the previous night. I told him he should have. On date two, we baked more cookies and watched three new movies. He put his arm around my shoulder, and the following night, through AIM, he told me that he had wanted to kiss me the night before. I told him he should have. On our third date, we knew what was going to happen. The pattern had been established, so in between movies, when he turned to me and searched my face for my answer, I shyly looked away, embarrassed that I was twenty-one and had never been kissed. \"Can I kiss you? \"he asked, and I covered my blushing face. \"Yes.

Unexpectedly, she leaned in and took a hearty chomp from the corner while it was still in my hands. Shocked, I immediately dropped it, letting the contents of the sub splash everywhere on the table. \" Oh my God! \" I exclaimed immediately, as I watched her eyes become wide with surprise. \" I' m so sorry... \" She hid her mouth behind her hand as she tried to not to laugh and chew at the same time. \" It' s okay! \" she comforted me. \" I' ll go grab us some napkins. \" After she left the table, I pulled the collar of my sweatshirt over my face. \"",

It was now or never. Due to my agile build and quick maneuverability, the guards kept missing their shots. They reloaded their guns but by then I had neared the edge of the water. I leaped and dived into the cool water, away from my attackers. Underwater, I felt sad for leaving Larry behind. He was my childhood friend, no, my best friend. I swam to the other edge of the water and resurfaced. I turned around and I could see Larry jumping and cheering.

Now all that remained was to see whether she had been frozen fast enough so that ice crystals would n' t form inside her cells. \" We' ll have to take a tissue sample \" \" Is a piece of the pinky fine? \" one asked. \" Sure, just be careful. \" The analysis only took one minute.

There are silverware, pots and pans, dishes, halloween costumes, shoes, baby items and even furniture and electronics. The only down side to this store is that there is no dressing room. So the only real thing you can try on are coats and shoes. I see people trying shirts and pants on over there clothes sometimes but it proves rather difficult unless they are men.

But this time, it felt different. The opponent was relentless, ferocious, and seemed impervious to her efforts. No matter how hard she fought, they wouldn't stay down. Every punch she threw, every strategy she employed, they simply shrugged it off and kept advancing. Doubt crept into her mind for the first time, whispering that maybe this was a battle she couldn't win. But she quickly shook off those thoughts and dug deep within herself, finding a wellspring of resilience and determination. She refused to be defeated. Bloodied and bruised, she unleashed a final barrage of punches, pouring her heart and soul into each one. Yet, to her disbelief, they continued to stand, mocking her with their unbending resolve. Exhaustion threatened to consume her, her body aching from the relentless onslaught. She was running out of options, her mind scrambling for a new strategy. Suddenly, a memory flashed before her eyes, an old mentor's voice echoing in her ears. \"Sometimes the greatest strength lies not in victory, but in persistence,\" he had said. Those words became her fuel, igniting a fire within her. She mustered every ounce of strength and resilience, refusing to give up. Summoning her last reserves of energy, she launched a devastating attack, channeling her frustration, pain, and determination into each blow. Finally, her adversary staggered, their unbreakable facade wavered. She seized the opportunity, delivering a decisive blow that sent them crashing to the ground. The battle was over. She stood victorious, panting heavily and covered in sweat and dirt. It had been the hardest fight of her life, but she had emerged triumphant.",

It all began with a seemingly innocent typo, as I diligently filled out my Superpower Application Form. My fingers danced across the keyboard, eager to claim my extraordinary ability. However, fate had other plans in store for me.With a mischievous grin, fate conspired against me, causing my trembling fingers to mistype a crucial word: \"immortality.\" Alas, I inadvertently pressed the submit button, sealing my destiny with an unintended power. Little did I know that my innocent mistake would unleash a torrent of unforeseen consequences.As the days turned into weeks, an eerie realization dawned upon me. I was not invincible; I was merely immoral. I discovered that my newfound power rendered me impervious to death, but it came at a chilling cost. I watched helplessly as time relentlessly marched forward, leaving me as an eternal spectator in a world that continued to evolve without me.Trapped within the confines of my unchanging existence, I became an unwitting observer of life's fleeting moments. The joy of new beginnings and the sorrow of final farewells - none of it held any sway over me. My heart yearned for the embrace of death, a release from this perpetual limbo, but alas, it remained an elusive desire.In my solitary confinement, I found solace in the written word. My pen became my companion, my stories a refuge from the monotony of my immortal existence. Through the characters I created, I experienced a semblance of life's joys and tribulations, living vicariously through their triumphs and heartbreaks.Yet, as the centuries rolled on, even the solace of storytelling began to fade.

Yet, that cigarette remained a symbol of her strength and willpower, a reminder of the battles she had fought and conquered.

The struggles, the triumphs, and the journey flooded her mind, tugging at her heartstrings.

It felt different in her hand after all those years, weathered by time and life experiences. With trembling fingers, she placed it between her lips and lit it with an old lighter.As the smoke curled around her, Sarah exhaled slowly, savoring the taste that danced on her tongue. It was not the nicotine she craved, but rather the symbolism of that final act.

The music is always top notch with DJs spinning the latest dance hits. The dance floor is large enough to accommodate many partygoers yet still feels intimate. Drinks are reasonably priced for a nightclub and they offer a great selection of beers, liquors, and cocktail options. I've never had to wait long for drinks at the bar and the bartenders are friendly. The dressing is trendy but casual, most people dressed to dance and have a good time. The club puts on different themed nights throughout the week to keep things feeling fresh. Last time I attended it was ladies night so there was a great female to male ratio. Bathrooms were clean when I've used them. Security checks ID's at the door but isn't overly aggressive. The club is in a safe area and there is plenty of well-lit parking nearby. Lighting in the club ranges from dim to bright flashes syncing with the music. They have booth seating or high tables around the perimeter if you want to take a break from dancing. On weekends it can get crowded on the dance floor but it's never been too cramped or uncomfortable. They occasionally have live performers for more unique nights out. The DJ booth is elevated to give the performers plenty of visibility. Overall this is one of my favorite places to dance the night away with friends. Management seems to keep it fresh with new promotions andevents. I would highly recommend checking it out if you're looking for a lively club to party at on weekends. Make reservations if going on a Saturday to avoid longer lines.",

I had to stand there for a few minutes before she finally acknowledged me and asked how she could help me.When I told her that I was there for a haircut, she seemed put off and told me that they were busy and wouldn't be able to get to me for at least an hour. I was a bit taken aback by this, but I decided to wait anyway. I sat down in the waiting area and began to flip through a magazine to pass the time.After about 45 minutes, my name was called and I was led to a stylist's chair. The stylist introduced herself as Sarah, and she seemed nice enough. However, as soon as she started cutting my hair, I could tell that something was off. She was chopping away at my locks with no regard for the length or the shape of my hair. I tried to speak up and tell her that I wanted a trim, not a full-on haircut, but she ignored me and continued to cut away.When she was finished, I was horrified by what I saw in the mirror. My hair was way shorter than I had wanted, and it looked completely uneven. I tried to politely tell Sarah that I wasn't happy with the way my hair looked, but she just shrugged and told me that it was what I had asked for.",

One sunny afternoon, while exploring the dense forest behind her house, she stumbled upon an old, decaying tree. Intrigued, she approached it and noticed a small key nestled amidst the moss-covered branches. Lily's eyes gleamed with excitement as she imagined the mysteries this key could unlock. As the evening fell, Lily returned home and showed the key to her parents, who seemed strangely apprehensive. They warned her that the key belonged to an ancient chest rumored to contain a haunting secret. Unfazed by their warnings, Lily waited until nightfall to venture back into the woods alone. Guided by the moon's pale light, she reached the clearing where the chest awaited. Heart pounding, she inserted the key and turned it with a sense of anticipation. The chest creaked open, revealing a chilling sight—an eerie, ghostly figure emerged from the darkness, its hollow eyes fixed on Lily. Paralyzed with fear, Lily watched as the specter spoke in a bone-chilling voice, recounting the story of its tragic demise. It vowed to haunt whoever dared disturb its resting place. Lily's blood turned to ice as the ghostly figure advanced towards her, its ghostly hands reaching out. The once enchanting forest transformed into a nightmarish maze, with gnarled branches clawing at her as she desperately tried to escape. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears, drowning out her own terrified screams. Just as the specter was about to grasp her, Lily felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if an icy grip had clutched her heart. She woke up bathed in sweat, realizing it was all just a nightmare. Relieved, she climbed out of bed and glanced at her bedroom mirror.",

Against my better judgment, sympathy compelled me to help him, opening the door to a nightmare I never anticipated. Jake had unwittingly gotten tangled up with a powerful criminal organization, and now they were after him, mercilessly hunting him down.

At first, people were relieved by the sudden drop in violence. But as time went on without any suspicious deaths, unease started to set in. How could a city of over 8 million people suddenly have zero killings over so many months? The police were baffled and overwhelmed trying to solve old cold cases without the usual stream of new murders. Forensics labs sat mostly empty as bodies stopped arriving for autopsy. Even the city morgue seemed too quiet. Investigators found themselves with free time, a rare occurrence in a place known for its crime.Conspiracy theories spread online and in the tabloids. Had some secret government program been enacted to curb murder through technological means? Were vigilantes taking the law into their own hands and discreetly disposing of would-be killers? Some thought alien intervention was quietly cleaning the streets, while others speculated the rapture had silently come and gone.As the months wore on, a task force was formed to get to the bottom of the lull in lethal crimes. They started by double checking every missing person and Jane Doe case for any links to murder. Public tips poured in about possible unreported deaths. Officers were pulled from other duties to chase down every lead, no matter how outlandish.Still nothing surfaced to explain the halt in homicides. The complete absence of even accidental or justified killings became truly improbable. People started looking over their shoulders, paranoid that the perpetrator was watching from the shadows. The tensions rose higher with each passing murder-free week.The task force leader knew they had to solve this mystery before public fear spiraled out of control.",

With each new conquest, my doubts grew.After weeks of temptation, I went to Lucifer for reevaluation. To my shock, he was pleased with my success. \"You've outperformed my previous sin,\" he boasted. But I had other plans now. I told Lucifer I wanted out, that manipulating humans against their will was unethical. His expression darkened in fury. \"You dare defy me?\" he bellowed, eyes burning red. I stood my ground, insisting my work was done. With a roar, Lucifer grabbed me by the throat.Through sheer force of will, I broke his grip. We faced off, his power against my growing resolve. Then, to my surprise, he threw back his head and laughed.",

But as the day went on, his condition rapidly deteriorated. He was rushed to the hospital, and the doctors gave us the devastating news: John had a brain tumor, and it was terminal.The doctors suggested an experimental treatment - a mind transfer. They explained that they could transfer John's mind into my brain, giving him a chance to live on. It was a risky procedure, but we were desperate. We agreed to go forward with it.As the procedure began, I could feel John's mind slowly being transplanted into my brain. It was a strange, disorienting feeling, like a voice in my head that wasn't my own. But I knew it was John, and I was determined to make this work.But just as the transfer was complete, John's heart stopped beating. The doctors tried to revive him, but it was too late. He was gone. I was left alone in my body, with two minds now inhabiting it.At first, it was chaos. I couldn't distinguish between my own thoughts and John's. It was like having a constant conversation in my head, with two different voices fighting for control. But slowly, we began to adjust.John's presence in my mind became more subtle, a gentle whisper instead of a loud voice. I could feel his love and support, even though he was no longer with me physically.I continued to live my life, but now with John's influence guiding me. We made decisions together, and I could feel his happiness when I did something he approved of.It wasn't easy, but we made it work.",

If you say so,\" he replied skeptically. \"Trust me, it'll work out.\" \"Anything else I should know?\" my past self inquired. \"Take care of your back,\" I warned, \"those late nights at the office will catch up to you.\" \"Yikes, thanks for the heads up,\" he responded. \"Oh and buy some bitcoin when you hear about it, cash out in 2017,\" I added eagerly. \"Bitcoin?

They had expected to find some signs of life, but instead, they found nothing. No plants, no animals, no microorganisms. Just a barren, rocky landscape.The team began to study the planet's atmosphere, searching for clues as to why it was so lifeless. They discovered that the atmosphere was composed of mostly carbon dioxide, with no oxygen or nitrogen.As they dug deeper, they found that the planet's surface was covered in a thick layer of perchlorates, a type of salt that is toxic to most forms of life. It seemed that Mars had once had water, but it had long since disappeared.The team continued to explore the planet, searching for any signs of life. They found none. Not even a single-celled organism could survive on Mars.Despite the bleakness of the planet, the team remained hopeful.

When I went outside, everyone stopped and stared, whispering to each other in fearful tones. The elders gathered to discuss what this could mean. They decided I must be possessed by some evil spirit. Terrified of what was happening to me, I locked myself in my small hut.As the day went on, my unusual eyes began to hurt intensely. It felt like knives were stabbing the inside of my eyelids. Through the pain, I noticed the color start to shift, bits of orange and pink appearing amongst the violet. By evening, the color had blended into a brilliant sunrise hue. My village friends came with the healer, anxious to examine me. To their surprise, the healer said my eyes foretold something special, though she did not know what.The next morning, the strangest thing occurred. I awoke with eyes the soft pink of dawn, and I somehow knew things I had never learned. Visions of the future came to me as clear as the present. I saw that a terrible storm would strike the village in three days and shared this with the elders. They were impressed by my new gift and no longer feared me as an ill omen.",

After my hair was washed, she applied a deep conditioning treatment. Again, she asked me to purchase the product several times. I reminded her, again, that I was not interested.After the shampoo and conditioner, I was taken to the stylist's chair. She asked me what I wanted done and I explained that I was wanting my hair colored, cut and styled. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she said that she could do that. While she was coloring my hair, she continued to try to sell me products. At the sink, she started washing out the color and as she did, she told me that I needed a gloss on my hair. I asked her how much it would cost and she said $20.00. Since I was already over an hour into the appointment and was very frustrated at this point, I reluctantly said yes. When she rang me up, she had added $25.00 to my bill. I questioned her and she stated that the price for the gloss was $45.00. When I asked why she had told me it was $20.00, she said that that is what it costs for short hair. Well, my hair is not short and she knew that when she quoted me the price!When she finally finished styling my hair, she called me over to the mirror.",

He would watch with envy as these heroes embarked on exciting quests and fulfilled their destinies, yearning for a taste of the epic adventures that lay beyond the confines of the village.One fateful day, as Edgar hammered away at an iron sword, a commotion erupted in the village square. The villagers gathered around, their faces filled with awe and admiration. Edgar pushed his way through the crowd, his heart pounding with anticipation. There, standing tall and radiant, was the hero of prophecy, the Chosen One, clad in shimmering armor and wielding a legendary sword.Edgar's eyes widened with jealousy as he watched the hero receive blessings and accolades from the village elders.

The bread was overly toasted and almost burnt, making it difficult to bite into. The avocado was not ripe enough and lacked the smooth, creamy texture I was hoping for. It felt like a haphazardly assembled dish rather than a carefully prepared one. My partner ordered the vegan scramble, which consisted of tofu and vegetables. While the flavors were decent, the portion size was underwhelming, leaving us both feeling unsatisfied. To make matters worse, the coffee was lukewarm and tasted stale. It seemed like it had been sitting in the pot for far too long. We tried to request a fresh pot, but the server was nowhere to be found. The lack of attentiveness from the staff was a recurring theme throughout the entire meal. As we glanced around the restaurant, it was evident that others were experiencing similar frustrations. Tables around us were growing impatient and the murmurs of discontent filled the air. It was clear that the establishment was understaffed and struggling to keep up with the demand.

From the moment we walked in, it felt like we were invisible to the staff. We stood at the entrance for a good five minutes before someone finally acknowledged us and seated us at a table in the far corner. It was clear that the restaurant was understaffed, as we saw servers rushing around in a frenzy, struggling to keep up with the demand. Our server seemed overwhelmed and didn't take our drink order until we had been sitting there for almost 15 minutes. Throughout the meal, it was a challenge to flag down our server for any kind of assistance. The wait for our food was excruciatingly long. We watched as tables around us, who arrived after we did, were served their meals first. When our food finally arrived, it was lukewarm at best. The flavors were bland and uninspiring, and the portions were quite small considering the price we paid. I ordered the steak, medium-rare, but it came out more on the medium-well side. The texture was tough and chewy, far from the juicy and tender steak I was hoping for. The side dishes were nothing memorable either, lacking in seasoning and creativity. The ambiance of the restaurant was also a letdown. The lighting was dim, making it difficult to read the menu, and the music was turned up too loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation. The overall atmosphere felt cold and impersonal, lacking any charm or warmth. As we finished our meal, we waited for what felt like an eternity for our server to bring the check. When it finally arrived, we were shocked by the prices.",

I truly appreciate that they make it so easy for me to make conscious choices while shopping. One of the things that I love about Whole Foods is their extensive selection of organic produce. The fruits and vegetables always look fresh and vibrant, and I can taste the difference in their quality. It's reassuring to know that I'm getting the best possible ingredients for my meals. Speaking of meals, their prepared food section is a real lifesaver for those busy days when I don't have time to cook. The variety and flavors they offer are impressive. Whether I'm in the mood for a hearty salad, a flavorful stir-fry, or a delicious sushi roll, Whole Foods has it all. Plus, their hot food bar is a treasure trove of mouthwatering options.I also appreciate the fact that Whole Foods carries a wide range of specialty products. If I'm looking for a specific brand or an obscure ingredient for a recipe, I can usually find it here. It saves me the hassle of going to multiple stores to track down what I need. The staff is always helpful and knowledgeable, which makes my shopping experience even better.Now, some people argue that Whole Foods is expensive, but I beg to differ. Sure, some items may have a higher price tag compared to conventional supermarkets, but the quality justifies the cost. This is especially true when it comes to their meat and seafood selection. The grass-fed beef and sustainably sourced fish are worth the investment for the superior taste and ethical considerations.Another aspect that sets Whole Foods apart is their commitment to supporting local farmers and producers.",

He opened his eyes to see a figure standing at the foot of his bed, cloaked in shadows. \"Who are you?\" the man asked, his voice weak and raspy. \"I am Death,\" the figure replied, its voice low and gravelly. \"And I have come to collect your soul. \"The man felt a sense of fear wash over him, but he also felt a twinge of excitement. He had always heard that Death was a gamer, and he couldn't help but wonder if he could challenge him to a game. \"Hey, Death,\" the man said, trying to sound casual. \"You know, I've always been a big fan of videogames. Do you think we could play a game before you take me away? \"Death was taken aback by the man's request, but it was also intrigued. It had been a long time since anyone had asked to play a game with it, and it was curious to see what this mortal had to offer. \"Very well,\" Death said. \"But if you lose, you must come with me willingly. \"The man nodded eagerly, and Death pulled out a small, sleek console from beneath its cloak.",

Ignoring her less-than-inviting presence, I requested a table for two and was led to a corner booth that seemed to be hidden away from the rest of the restaurant.

The sides lacked seasoning and were barely warm.

It took longer than expected for my pizza to arrive, and there were moments when I had difficulty getting the attention of a server. Despite the challenges, the staff remained friendly and apologetic, which helped alleviate some of the frustration.One aspect that truly disappointed me was the lack of attention to detail in presentation. The pizza looked disheveled and unappetizing, with toppings falling off the slices and sauce smeared haphazardly.

We felt like we were being taken advantage of and that the venue was trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of its patrons.After the show, we tried to voice our concerns to the management, but they seemed disinterested and dismissive. They didn't take our feedback seriously and seemed more focused on ushering us out of the venue.Overall, our experience at the Pittsburgh Improv was a complete letdown.",

The station itself was worn and weathered, reflecting the passage of time and the stories of countless travelers who had passed through. It had become a place of transitions, of farewells and beginnings. People hurried past, their footsteps echoing against the tiled floor, their faces etched with anticipation or muted sadness. Each person carried a story, a baggage of memories and experiences. I wondered about their destinations and the significance of this particular journey. A young couple walked by, their hands intertwined and their eyes filled with an unspoken promise. Perhaps they were embarking on a new adventure together, leaving behind the familiar for the unknown. An elderly man sat on a bench, his gaze distant and his hands grasping an old photograph. Was he reminiscing about a love lost, reliving moments of joy and heartbreak? A child tugged at her mother's sleeve, excitement gleaming in her eyes. She was too young to understand the weight of farewells, only embracing the thrill of new beginnings. The stationmaster's voice crackled over the intercom, announcing the arrival of the last train. It was a melancholic sound, a declaration of finality. I felt a pang of sadness within me, knowing that this journey marked an end to something significant. As the train approached, its whistle wailed like a mournful cry. Passengers began to board, their steps hesitant yet determined. I watched as loved ones hugged tightly, tears streaming down their faces. There were promises made and whispered words of encouragement. The platform became a tapestry of emotions, where hearts collided and souls separated.",

With a roar, the great rocket lifted them up above the clouds. Four days later, their Apollo 11 spacecraft reached the moon. But landing would be tricky with dangers everywhere. Carefully, Neil piloted the small lunar module called Eagle down to the dusty grey surface. \"The Eagle has landed,\" he said once they touched down.Buzz and Neil put on their bulky space suits then opened the hatch. They were the first humans ever to set foot on the moon!Neil was the first to climb down the ladder onto the moon. As his boot touched, he proclaimed \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. \"They explored the alien landscape, collected moon rocks, and planted an American flag. But they only had a little over two hours outside. Then it was time to return to the module. They blasted off from the moon and rejoined Mike in the command module called Columbia.After collecting samples and photos, the three astronauts began their journey home. But the road was long, three days in space alone.At last, they spotted the blue sphere of Earth below. They were nearing home! They had achieved a dream that would inspire the world.

The wait just to get through the checkpoint can take 30 minutes or more during peak times. Once you finally make it through, it's hard to find an open seat at the gate areas since they fill up quickly. You often end up sitting on the floor or standing the whole time waiting to board. The shops and restaurants are packed too, making it difficult to find a table to sit down and eat. You pretty much have to grab your food to-go if you want to avoid standing the whole time. Even using the restrooms is a challenge, as long lines frequently spill out the doors during busy periods. Finding a place to charge your phone can also be an issue with limited open power outlets.Parking is a nightmare if you're dropping someone off or picking them up. The designated waiting areas fill up fast, so yousometimes end up waiting in the arrival/departure lanes and blocking traffic. Navigating through the crowds with luggage is also tricky, as there always seems to be a bottleneck where large groups converge.The amount of announced delays and gate changes adds to the chaos as well. It's hard to keep track of your flight with so much activity happening all at once. The airlines also seem to pack all the departure times close together, ensuring a massive crowd is constantly rushing between terminals. During holidays or major events like conventions, the entire airport feels overly congested. Security lines stretch on for what feels like miles and customer service reps are swamped fielding questions.",

However, the wait time for my order was ridiculous. Even though the restaurant wasn't packed, it took them forever to prepare a simple burger and fries. Finally, my number was called, and I eagerly grabbed my tray, only to find that my order was completely wrong. Instead of a cheeseburger, I received a plain hamburger, and my medium fries were nowhere to be found. Frustrated, I approached the counter to get the issue resolved. The staff member I spoke to seemed annoyed by my complaint and made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. They reluctantly took back my incorrect order and started making a new one. Meanwhile, I watched as other customers also received incorrect orders and experienced similar frustrations. The lack of attention to detail and care for customer satisfaction was evident throughout the entire experience. When my corrected order finally arrived, the burger was lukewarm, and the fries were soggy. It was far from the fresh and flavorful meal I had hoped for.

He had never thought of Death as a learner, let alone a chess player. \"Why do you want to learn chess?\" he asked, his curiosity piqued. \"Because it is a game of strategy and skill, and I want to understand the minds of those who play it,\" Death replied.Samuel thought for a moment. Fifty extra years of life was a tempting offer, but he was not sure if he wanted to spend eternity playing chess with Death.But then he thought of all the moves he could teach, all the strategies he could share, and all the games they could play together. \"Alright,\" he said finally. \"I accept your offer.",

        "text": "We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. Let me start by saying that we had high expectations for this iconic Pittsburgh institution. The place was bustling with locals and tourists, creating a lively atmosphere that added to our anticipation. As we perused the menu, we couldn't help but notice the sheer size of the sandwiches. They were unlike anything we had seen before, towering with mountains of coleslaw and fries stuffed between thick slices of Italian bread. Impressed by the reputation, we decided to try their famous \"Pitts-Burger\" and a classic pastrami sandwich. The service was friendly and attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive.However, as we took the first bite of the Pitts-Burger, we were slightly disappointed. While the meat was well-cooked and flavorful, the excessive amount of slaw and fries overwhelmed the overall taste. The coleslaw had a tangy flavor, but it dominated the sandwich, leaving little room for the other ingredients to shine. The fries, although crispy, became soggy due to the combination of condiments. It felt more like eating a coleslaw and fry sandwich with a hint of burger rather than a well-balanced burger.Moving on to the pastrami sandwich, we hoped it would redeem our dining experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations as well. The pastrami lacked the tenderness and bold flavors we've come to love in a classic deli sandwich. The bread, although fresh, couldn't make up for the underwhelming fillings. We were left craving more complexity and depth in the tastes.On the positive side, the restaurant's ambiance and history added charm to our visit. The walls were adorned with sports memorabilia and photographs, showcasing the local pride and strong community spirit.",

The atmosphere lacked the charm and elegance we had come to expect from the Morton's chain. The dim lighting, instead of creating a cozy ambiance, felt more like they were trying to hide something. We were seated at a table near the kitchen, and the constant clatter and hustle added to the overall chaotic vibe.To make matters worse, the service was far from what we had grown accustomed to. Our waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive, barely making eye contact or offering recommendations. It took ages for him to bring us menus, and even longer to take our drink orders. Our hopes for a delightful evening were quickly dwindling.When the food finally arrived, it was a mixed bag. While some dishes were decent, others were downright disappointing. The steak, which we had always considered Morton's specialty, lacked the tenderness and juiciness we had savored in the past. It was overcooked and lacked the distinctive charred flavor that had always made Morton's steaks stand out.As the evening progressed, we couldn't help but feel the magic was missing. It was as if this Morton's had forgotten the secret recipe to providing a memorable dining experience. The once impeccable reputation of Morton's seemed to have been lost in this Pittsburgh location. You're kidding, right? To think we had been eagerly anticipating this meal, only to be met with mediocrity and lackluster execution.Overall, our visit to Morton's in Pittsburgh was a big mistake. It pains me to admit it, but it fell far short of the high standards we had experienced at other branches.",

I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should even bother stepping inside.But I was hungry, and the GPS had assured me that this was the closest restaurant to my location. So, with a shrug, I pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The interior was just as rundown as the exterior, with peeling paint, broken tables, and a generally unclean atmosphere. I was beginning to regret my decision already.As I looked around, I noticed a small, uninviting counter in the corner of the room. Behind it stood a gruff-looking man with a thick beard and a dirty apron. He eyed me warily as I approached, and I couldn't blame him. I must have looked like a lost tourist, wandering into this dive of a restaurant. \"Welcome to Joe's Diner,\" he grunted, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"What can I get for you? \"I hesitated, unsure of what to order.

Let me tell you, one bite of those nachos, and I knew I was in for a treat.For the main course, I went with their signature BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The succulent, slow-cooked pork was slathered in a tangy and smoky barbecue sauce that had just the right amount of kick. The soft, pillowy bun held it all together like a delicious porky hug. It was messy, finger-licking goodness that hit the spot after a long day on the road.The service was top-notch too. The staff was friendly and attentive, always ready with a smile and quick to refill my empty pint glass. Speaking of pints, their beer selection was impressive, with a variety of local craft brews and classic favorites.

The place was pretty packed for a Tuesday morning. I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table but the staff were really friendly and chatty so the time passed quickly. My coffee came and it was piping hot just the way I like it. I sipped it slowly and watched the hustle and bustle at the counter as people ordered their breakfasts and lunches. Everyone seemed in high spirits. The atmosphere was really lively.I decided to treat myself to a breakfast pastry since I had some time to spare before work. The selection looked incredible with so many homemade options. I went for the almond croissant since those are my favorite. It was massive! So buttery and flaky on the outside and still warm and soft on the inside. As I was finishing up my coffee, I noticed a regular customer I’ve seen in there a few times come rushing in, clearly frazzled. She spilled her whole order all over the counter and started tearing up, embarrassed. But the staff just laughed it off and reassured her, getting her a fresh order right away. They really seem to care about the customers.Just then my phone went off with an alert from work - I was going to be late if I didn’t get a move on. I rushed to pay but the server told me not to worry and to enjoy the rest of my pastry for the road. That’s always so nice when places understand you’re in a hurry.Overall the staff really make you feel at home at Mama Ricotta's.",

Yeah, you heard it right, we were gonna release Earth fauna on these poor little guys. It sounded like a crazy plan, but hey, when has that ever stopped humanity, right? So, they dropped these containers filled with a whole menagerie of creatures onto the planets. Lions, tigers, bears, you name it. It was like Noah's Ark gone wild. The grubs didn't know what hit 'em. At first, they were all like, \"Whoa, what are these big furry things?\" But those creatures went to town on them, man. It was like an all-you-can-eat buffet for the Earth fauna. The grubs tried to fight back, but come on, they were tiny and these creatures were like ten times their size. They didn't stand a chance. It was brutal, I tell ya. The lush planets turned into a battleground, with grubs scurrying for cover and Earth fauna tearing through everything in their path. It was like a scene out of a sci-fi horror flick. The leaders back on Earth were celebrating, thinking they had done a great thing, getting rid of these grubs. But some of us, we couldn't help but feel a little guilty, you know? I mean, these grubs were just minding their own business, and here we were, wiping them out. It didn't sit right with me. As the days went by, the grubs started to dwindle in number.

She hates my friends, always finds a way to criticize my choices, and never misses a chance to pick a fight with me. But you know what's weird? Every time she tries to sabotage me, things end up turning out better for me. It's like she's unintentionally working in my favor.I woke up this morning with a knot in my stomach. Today was the day I had decided to propose to her. Crazy, right? I mean, she can be a total bitch sometimes, but somehow, I still love her. Maybe it's because her attempts to ruin my life always backfire. I guess there's a twisted kind of charm to that.So, I started getting ready for the big moment. I bought the most beautiful engagement ring I could afford, hoping it would make her forget about all the arguments and resentments. I even invited our closest friends to witness this moment, hoping their presence would sway her mood.When she arrived at the park where we were supposed to meet, she seemed annoyed as usual. She made some snarky comments about my choice of location and how I always make everything about me. But you know what? The park was actually her favorite place to go as a child, so it brought back some nice memories for her.As we stood there, surrounded by our friends, I got down on one knee and held out the ring. Her jaw dropped, and for a moment, I could see genuine surprise and happiness in her eyes.",

I was filled with a sense of peace and serenity, knowing that I had finally found my resting place.But as I lay there, I began to hear a faint noise. It was a distant, muffled sound, but it was getting louder and louder. I tried to open my eyes, but they were sealed shut. I tried to move my body, but it was as if I was encased in cement.Suddenly, the noise became deafening. It was like a thousand jackhammers were drilling into my head. I felt a sharp pain in my chest, and then everything went black.When I woke up, I was lying in a hospital bed. I was hooked up to all sorts of machines, and I could hear the beeping of the monitors. I tried to move my arm, but it was still too weak.A doctor came into the room and smiled at me. \"You're awake,\" he said. \"How are you feeling? \"I tried to speak, but my voice was hoarse and weak. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"You were in a car accident,\" the doctor said. \"You were hit by a drunk driver. \"I closed my eyes and tried to remember the accident, but everything was still a blur. \"How long was I out?\" I asked. \"Two weeks,\" the doctor said. \"You've been in a coma. \"I took a deep breath and tried to process everything that had happened. I had been in a car accident, and I had been in a coma for two weeks. \"Can I see my family?\" I asked. \"Of course,\" the doctor said.",

First off, let me say that I've been a regular shopper at this store for years now, and overall, it has been a reliable and convenient option for me. The staff has always been friendly and helpful whenever I had questions or needed assistance finding something. I genuinely appreciate their willingness to go the extra mile.Now, let's talk about the produce department. I've seen a few complaints about the quality, but honestly, I have to disagree. The store I go to consistently offers a decent selection of fresh fruits and vegetables. Of course, there will be the occasional bruised apple or wilted lettuce, but that's par for the course in any grocery store. You just have to be a smart shopper and choose wisely.Another point that some reviewers mentioned is the issue of cleanliness. Personally, I haven't noticed any major cleanliness problems during my visits. Sure, there might be the occasional spill or an untidy shelf, but the store staff is usually quick to address these issues. They're clearly making an effort to maintain a decent level of cleanliness.As for the checkout lines, yes, there can be moments of congestion during busy hours, but let's be fair here—what grocery store doesn't experience that? I've found that the store has made improvements over time to tackle this issue. They've increased the number of checkout registers and have even introduced self-checkout options for those who prefer a quicker process. It's a step in the right direction.Now, let's address the pricing concern.",

And don't even get me started on their fries - so crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, you know? I'm always coming here when I'm downtown because the location is so convenient too. It's right on the corner of 5th and Main so super easy to stop by on my lunch break. All the staff here are really nice too, they always remember my name and what I usually get which is cool. The vibe inside is really laid back and chill too. They got those big comfy booths and it's not too loud so you can actually have a conversation without yelling. A bunch of my friends and I met up here last weekend and we were there for hours just drinking beers and catching up. The prices here are also so reasonable, you won't believe it. Like you can get such huge portions for not that much money at all. I don't know how they do it! And they have all different food and drink specials going on all the time too which is awesome. Anytime I have people visiting from out of town, this is literally the first place I bring them. I'm like \"you HAVE to go to this restaurant, you won't be disappointed.\" And they always end up loving it too!

Pyotr was loved by all the animals in the forest for his infectious laughter and warm heart.One sunny morning, as Pyotr hopped through the meadow, he stumbled upon a tiny, wounded bird lying helplessly on the ground. Its wing was broken, and it chirped in pain. Pyotr's heart melted, and he knew he had to help his new friend.With great care, Pyotr carried the bird to his burrow, where he gently wrapped its wing in soft leaves and offered it some sweet berries to eat. Day after day, Pyotr nursed the bird back to health, sharing his favorite treats and singing lullabies to comfort it.As the days passed, a deep bond formed between Pyotr and the bird. They would spend their mornings exploring the meadow together, chasing butterflies and playing hide-and-seek among the flowers. But one fateful day, a terrible storm struck the forest.The wind howled, and the rain poured down in sheets, making it impossible for Pyotr and his feathered friend to venture outside. As they huddled together in the burrow, the little bird's condition worsened. Despite Pyotr's desperate efforts to keep it warm and safe, the bird's tiny body grew weaker.With tears streaming down his furry cheeks, Pyotr whispered, \"Dear friend, I wish there was something more I could do to ease your pain. \"Miraculously, the bird fluttered its wings and chirped softly, as if to say goodbye. Pyotr knew in his heart that it was time for his little friend to spread its wings and fly free.In a bittersweet farewell, Pyotr carried the bird outside and placed it gently on a blooming flower.",

Apparently, it's rocket science for this bakery.I ordered a beautiful, elegant cake with the words \"Congratulations Sarah and Mark\" in delicate cursive icing. What did they do? They slapped on some sloppy, generic message that said, \"Happy Anniversary.\" Are you kidding me? This was her bridal shower, not her anniversary! It was supposed to be a special moment, and they ruined it with their carelessness.I was so embarrassed when I unveiled the cake in front of all the guests. Everyone was expecting this gorgeous creation with a heartfelt message, and instead, we got this generic mess that didn't make any sense. It was like a punch in the gut, and I couldn't believe how unprofessional and inattentive the bakery staff were.To make matters worse, when I complained to the staff, they didn't even apologize properly. They acted like it was no big deal, as if I was overreacting. Excuse me? I paid good money for a cake that was supposed to be the centerpiece of the entire event, and they messed it up big time. Their dismissive attitude and lack of accountability just added salt to the wound.I will never, ever, go back to that bakery again. Their incompetence and lack of attention to detail are beyond infuriating. I trusted them to create something special for my sister's bridal shower, and they let me down in the worst way possible.

We worked tirelessly, building it up from nothing, and it was a wild success.But as the years passed, I realized that I had lost myself in our relationship. I had given up my passion and my dream, and I was stuck in a life that wasn't truly mine. I was living for him, not for me.One day, I finally realized that I couldn't do it anymore.

It was one of those rare occasions where we both agreed on a restaurant without any back-and-forth debate. We had heard good things about Tambellini's, so we thought it would be the perfect choice.When we arrived at Tambellini's, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to our table. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with dim lighting and soft music playing in the background. It set the mood for a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience.As we perused the menu, we were impressed by the variety of options available. From classic Italian dishes like lasagna and spaghetti to more adventurous choices like seafood risotto and veal Marsala, the menu catered to a range of tastes. It was clear that Tambellini's aimed to please all types of diners.We decided to start with the bruschetta appetizer, which turned out to be a delightful choice. The crusty bread was toasted to perfection, topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Each bite was a burst of flavors that awakened our taste buds and left us eager for more.For the main course, I went with the classic fettuccine Alfredo, while my friend opted for the chicken Parmesan. Unfortunately, our main dishes fell short of our expectations. The fettuccine Alfredo lacked the creaminess and richness I had come to expect from this dish. It felt rather bland and lacked the signature flavor that makes it so comforting. My friend's chicken Parmesan was also underwhelming, with dry chicken and a lackluster marinara sauce.However, the disappointment didn't end with the main course.",

I'll tell ya, I'm bout fed up with this gig shuttlin' drunk idiots around all night. These meat sacks puke and pass out in my backseat more nights than not, it's downright disgusting. Anyways, it was bout closin' time and I gets one last call - some frat boy named Chad requestin' a ride from the Gamma Gamma Haus. When Chad climbs in he's barely standin', slurrin' nonsense about tequila shots and assorted debauchery. I ask for the destination and ol' Chad just laughs and says \"surprise me driver, I'm in for quite the ride tonight!\". Well friends, somethin' in ol' Claude just decided to have me some fun for once. I takes off down Main Street, windin' er' up past the speed limit with Chad whoopin' and hollerin' in the back. Then as we pass the Dairy Queen I get an idea, slam on the brakes and send Chad flyin' face first into the plexiglass divider. He's howlin' and cursin' as I peel out, swervin' between the lines on the empty road.Next thing ya know we're atop Lover's Leap, lookin' clear down to the river below. I rolls down the window and asks Chad real polite like \"So handsome, you wanna take a dip?\". Well I'll tell ya that frat boy sobered up real quick, pissin' his pants and beggin' me to take him home. But friends, the night was still young for ol' Claude! I guns it down the mountain road, not slowin' a lick through the curves. Chad's screams are like music to my audio receptors.",

He shuffled forward, his heart heavy with a sense of foreboding, until he finally reached the end of the row. And there, lying on a cold metal table, was his own corpse.The man's eyes widened in shock as he stared at his lifeless form. His mind raced with questions: how could this be? Was this some kind of cruel joke? Had he somehow been transported to a parallel universe where he was already dead?He reached out a trembling hand to touch his own forehead, feeling the cold, hard flesh that seemed so foreign to him. A sense of disbelief washed over him, as if he was watching himself from outside his body.The man's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching. He turned to see a mortician, a tall, thin man with a somber expression, standing behind him. \"Can I help you?\" the mortician asked, his voice low and gravelly.The man hesitated, unsure of what to say. \"I...I think I may have found my own corpse,\" he stammered.The mortician's expression remained unchanged. \"I see. Can you tell me your name? \"\"John,\" the man replied, his voice barely above a whisper.The mortician nodded. \"Yes, that's right. John Smith. I remember you. You died last week in a car accident. \"The man's eyes widened in shock. \"Last week? But...but how is this possible? \"The mortician shrugged. \"I don't have answers to questions like that. My job is to prepare the dead for their final rest. Yours is the first case I've seen where the deceased has come back to visit.",

Nothing else was written, just those seven strange words. \"It was inside you all along\". But what did it mean? And how did the thing even get here? A flash of lightning lit his chambers, revealing shadows in the corners that hadn't been there before. Or had they? Sir's heart began to race. He poured himself a finger of whiskey with a shaking hand. As he tossed it back, another flash came and for a moment he thought he saw a face peering back at him from the paper.The whisky wasn't helping to settle his nerves none. With a sigh he sat back in his chair, rubbing his temple with fingers, trying to ignore the scratching sounds now coming from the walls. That's when he noticed the book on his shelf was askew. Strange, he didn't recall touching it. Pulling it out, dust flew everywhere, causing him to cough. The book fell open as if by an invisible hand and a passage was highlighted. To his shock, it contained the same mysterious message. His blood ran cold as a realization started forming in his troubled mind.All those years of research, of studying ancient magics and hidden knowledge, could it be that all along he had found what he was searching for? But had not recognized it? It was there, buried deep in his own subconscious all this time. The answer was inside himself, as the paper, the book, were trying to reveal.But unlocking what lingered in the dark corners of his own psyche, that was surely too dangerous. Or was satisfying his curiosity, and claiming what was rightfully his, worth the risk?",

You see, I've always had a rebellious streak, and these publications perfectly capture the pulse of the counterculture. They feed my insatiable hunger for something beyond the mainstream. The glossy pages, adorned with vibrant artwork and edgy typography, beckon me into a world where conformity is forsaken and creativity knows no bounds.Each issue is a treasure trove of hidden gems, featuring interviews with up-and-coming artists, thought-provoking essays, and reviews of the latest indie releases. It's like stumbling upon a secret clubhouse for the misfits and dreamers alike. The articles themselves are a breath of fresh air compared to the mundane drivel you find in mainstream magazines. No fluff, no pretentiousness—just raw, unfiltered passion poured onto the pages.One of the things I admire most about these alternative periodicals is their commitment to authenticity. They pull no punches and fear no backlash. If a band sucks, they'll say it outright, with a healthy dose of wit and sarcasm. They don't pander to popular opinion or play by the rules of conventional journalism. Instead, they value integrity and strive to give a voice to those who are often overlooked.I remember when I stumbled upon an article that introduced me to a band I had never heard of before. The writer's enthusiasm was infectious, and I immediately sought out their music. It was a life-changing moment, an awakening to a whole new dimension of sonic wonder. That's the power of these alternative periodicals—they have the ability to shape taste, ignite curiosity, and inspire rebellion.Sure, they may not have the glossy appeal or the backing of major corporations, but that's precisely what makes them so special.",

The decline of Eastland Mall is a reflection of the decline of the city of Charlotte as a whole. For years the city has been losing population and businesses, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a job and make a living here. It is a shame to see what has happened to this once-thriving mall. It is a sad day when a once-thriving mall is forced to close its doors. It is a sign that the city is in trouble. The mall is just one more victim of the city’s decline. I hope that Charlotte can turn things around, but it will take a lot of work. In the meantime, I will have to find a new place to shop. I don’t know where I will go, but I know it won’t be Eastland Mall. The decline of the mall is also a reflection of the changing retail landscape. More and more people are shopping on the Internet, and traditional brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to compete. This is especially true of malls, which are often seen as outdated and inconvenient. The future of Eastland Mall is uncertain. It could be redeveloped into something else, or it could simply be demolished. Whatever happens, it is a sad day for Charlotte. I hope that the city can find a way to revitalize the area and create a new sense of community. The mall was a gathering place for the community, and many people will miss it. It is a reminder that nothing lasts forever. It is important to appreciate what we have while we have it, because it could be gone tomorrow.",

I visited a sick child in the hospital and cheered him up with a smile and a story. The next day his parents were in mourning. But I couldn't stop. People began to fear me and avoid me. They didn't want to be the one to receive my kindness. I visited old people's homes, orphanages, and hospices. I gave strangers a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold. I had to go on, no matter what the cost. The government took notice and soon they were after me. They feared my power, my ability to end lives with a single act of kindness. And I watched them leave this world. I went into hiding, moving from place to place, always looking over my shoulder. But I couldn't stop. I knew I was doing good, bringing peace to those who needed it most. One day I received a message from a young woman who was dying of a terminal illness. She begged me to visit her, to bring her peace before she left this world. I had to go, no matter what the risk. I went to her bedside and held her hand.

Then, as the years went by, scientists discovered that the planet had a finite number of souls to inhabit its inhabitants. This meant that every time a new person was born, an existing soul had to leave its body to make room for the new arrival. At first, people were sceptical about this idea. They thought it was just a myth, a way of explaining the strange things that were happening in the world. But as time went by, the evidence became irrefutable. People were disappearing, leaving behind only their physical bodies. The governments of the world struggled to find a solution to this problem. They introduced strict birth control measures, but it was too late. The damage had already been done. The number of souls on the planet was dwindling, and the world was becoming a desolate place. The cities were empty, and the few people who remained were struggling to survive. The last soul on the planet was a young girl called Lily. She wandered the empty streets, searching for any sign of life. She had been born into a world that was already beyond salvation. She had no idea what it was like to live in a world full of people, to experience the hustle and bustle of city life. She had given up hope of ever finding anyone else. But one day, she stumbled upon a strange object in the ruins of a building. It was a small, glowing orb. Lily picked it up, and suddenly felt a surge of energy.

It’s so convenient to have all the information I need right on my wrist. I can check the time, get notifications, and even track my fitness goals without having to carry my phone around. I can also track my sleep, which has been interesting to see how much rest I’m getting each night. One of my favorite features of my smartwatch is the ability to monitor my heart rate. I’ve been trying to get in shape lately, and it’s been really helpful to be able to track my progress. I also love that I can listen to music without having to carry my phone around while I’m working out. Another feature I’ve been using a lot is the music controls. I can easily control the music and volume right from my wrist, which is so much easier than having to pull out my phone every time I want to change a song. I’ve also been using the built-in timer to help me stay on schedule. One thing that has surprised me about my smartwatch is how long the battery lasts. It’s easy to set reminders and timers for different tasks and events, and it’s helpful to have them right on my wrist where I can see them.

I was taken aback, not knowing how to answer. “Is that you?” “Yes, it’s me,” she said, nodding, her silver hair shining in the light. “I’ve missed you so much,” I said, tears pricking my eyes. I felt a rush of emotion, a mixture of happiness and sadness. “I’ve come to visit you in your dreams.” “I’ve missed you too, my dear,” she said, her voice filled with compassion. “But I want you to know that I’m happy now. I’m in a good place, free from pain and suffering.” “I’m glad, Grandma. But why are you here?” I nodded, trying to take it all in. “I want you to know that it’s all right to let go,” she said, her eyes fixed on mine, “that you don’t have to hold on to your pain and sadness any more. Why have you come to visit me?” I felt a lump in my throat, my heart aching with emotion. “But I don’t want to lose you,” I said, barely above a whisper. “It’s time for you to move on, to live your life to the fullest.” “You won’t lose me, my dear,” she said, her voice firm but gentle. “I’ll always be with you, in your heart and in your memories. But it’s time for you to wake up and live your life without me here.” “All right, Grandma,” I said, my voice trembling with emotion. I knew she was right, that it was time for me to move on. I felt sad, but also peaceful.",

It was completely empty except for me and a middle-aged man who was standing a few feet in front of me. He had a kind face and a warm smile. “Hello, I’m Bill,” he said in a soft, reassuring voice. I was confused. “I’ll be in charge of your training.” Training for what? I tried to speak, but my voice was hoarse and barely audible. “Don’t worry,” he said. He handed me a glass of water, and I took a long drink. I looked around the room again, trying to make sense of it all. “You’re in a good place. You’re safe here.” “Where am I?” I asked. Everything was so white, so clean. It was like being in a dream. “You’re in a special place,” Bill said. “A place where you can learn and grow.” My voice was still shaky. I couldn’t understand. I had died. I should have been in heaven or hell, not in an empty white room. “I don’t understand,” I said, feeling a sense of panic rising inside me. “You don’t need to understand. Just trust me.” I took a deep breath and tried to calm down. Bill was calm and peaceful, and his presence seemed to calm me. “I’ll help you through this.” “What do you want me to do?” I asked. “Just follow my instructions.” I nodded, feeling a sense of determination rising inside me. I was ready to face whatever was coming. “I’ll teach you everything you need to know.” Bill smiled and nodded.",

Blood soaked his tattered armor, and pain etched deep lines on his weathered face. But he refused to yield, and his spirit burned brighter than ever. With every labored breath, he surveyed the desolate battlefield, where his comrades had fallen and the enemy was advancing. His sword, once a gleaming beacon of hope, now weighed heavy in his trembling hand. Memories of laughter and camaraderie flickered through his mind, fueling his resolve not to be erased by the brutality around him. A solitary tear slid down his cheek, mingling with sweat and grime. It carried the weight of a thousand emotions—grief, anger, and a deep-seated longing for a world untouched by strife. But the sword was not what weighed him down—it was the weight of the dreams shattered and the lives lost that weighed on his weary soul. The enemy horde closed in, their cries of triumph resonating through the night. But the hero held his ground, a solitary beacon of resistance. He summoned the last of his strength, determined to create a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness. Time, once a relentless force, now granted him a final moment of clarity. In that moment, he saw his purpose—to be a symbol of courage for those he had fought beside and protected. The world seemed to slow down as he faced his impending doom. As the enemy closed in, he fought with a ferocity that defied his wounds. Each blow he struck bore the weight of a lifetime of courage. A smile creased his weary face, for he knew that even in defeat he would leave an indelible mark on their hearts.",

But as the years passed, the song slipped away, buried under the cacophony of life’s demands. It had played softly in the background as she danced at her father’s feet, and echoed through the laughter of family gatherings. In her old age, Sarah’s determination was unwavering. She scoured dusty record shops, listened to countless radio stations, and asked anyone who would listen if they had ever heard the song. But she never gave up hope. She could almost hear it, a faint whisper in the back of her mind. Her family and friends doubted her sanity, believing the song was a figment of her imagination, a phantom melody that had no place in reality. But Sarah knew better. One stormy afternoon, as the rain pounded against her window, she found a tattered notebook in her attic. It had belonged to her late mother, who had shared her love of music. As she leafed through the pages, her heart pounded. There, carefully written down, were the notes to the elusive song she had spent a lifetime searching for. With trembling hands, she picked up her old guitar and carefully plucked the strings, following the notation on the page. It was as if her mother had left her this precious gift, an ethereal link between past and present. The room filled with a hauntingly beautiful melody, and tears streamed down her weathered cheeks as she finally found solace in the sound that had eluded her for so long. The song carried her back in time, conjuring up images of her childhood home, filled with love and laughter.",

Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and I wandered through this desolate landscape. Confusion seized me, and I questioned my existence in this eerie emptiness. My mind raced, desperately seeking an explanation for this bizarre phenomenon. What if I were the only one who existed? And then it struck me like a bolt of lightning. Everything around me was a construct, a figment of my imagination. If I were truly alone, then all the joys and sorrows I had experienced were nothing more than illusions of my mind. The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying. I questioned every memory, every interaction I had ever had. Were they real, or were they just fragments of a fabricated reality? Reality as I knew it was a coping mechanism, a way to deal with the unbearable loneliness that engulfed me. I delved deeper into this new awareness, exploring the boundaries of my imagination, sculpting landscapes that defied the laws of physics, creating cities that stretched beyond any horizon. There was no way to know for sure, for the only witness to my existence was myself. Days turned into years, and I delved deeper into this new awareness. I wandered through these creations, marveling at the beauty and complexity of my mind’s creations. But the excitement soon waned, replaced by a nagging emptiness. What was the purpose of these grand illusions if I was the only one who experienced them? What was the point of creation if there was no one to share it with? I was trapped in a self-imposed solitary confinement, forever yearning for something that could never be.",

Suddenly I stumbled upon a story that made my heart stop. It was about me. At first I thought it was just a normal fanfic, but as I started reading I realized that it was something completely different. The story portrayed me as a villain, someone who wanted to destroy the world. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. I tried to dismiss it, telling myself that it was just a silly story, but I couldn’t help feeling uneasy. How could anyone think that I would do such a thing? I felt a cold sweat trickle down my spine as I read on. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it only seemed to get worse. The story portrayed me as a monster, someone who took pleasure in the suffering of others. I couldn’t just sit there and let people think that I was a monster. How could anyone think that I was capable of such horrors? I knew that I had to do something, but I didn’t know what. I decided to try to find the person who had written the story. I scrolled through the author’s profile, trying to find any information that might lead me to them. Maybe they would listen to reason and take the story down. But it was all in vain. There was no way to contact them, no way to make them understand. I felt a wave of hopelessness wash over me. I knew that I wasn’t a monster, but how could I prove it to the world? How could I ever escape this horrible portrayal of myself?",

I panicked when I realized how unprepared I was. If I failed this assignment, I would have to repeat God School 101, and I really didn't want to be the god who was still in the first grade when everyone else had already graduated. All the other gods in my class were well on their way, some were even finishing their final touches, but I hadn't even started.

Over the next few days, I worked non-stop, barely sleeping or eating ambrosia, rushing to build planets, set physical laws, and seed the first life forms. My professor came to check on me, grimacing at the chaos, giving me some tips, but he seemed to doubt that I could finish in time.

The CDC was called in to investigate and soon confirmed their worst fears: this was the first outbreak of zombies in America. They seemed dazed, moved slowly, and groaned incomprehensibly. They shambled down the streets, occasionally grabbing at anyone they happened to encounter. Within hours, several more people had turned. The military was called in, but a coordinated response was difficult because of the zombies’ unpredictable movements. However, it soon became apparent that the zombies had no real sense of direction or higher brain function. They wandered aimlessly and barely managed to eat their occasional victim. After a day, the zombies were mostly just lying in the middle of the roads or in fields, having lost interest once their immediate hunger was satisfied. By nightfall, most of the zombies had simply collapsed and stopped moving. With no real packs or coordinated threats, they posed little danger. The remaining living inhabitants of the town were easily able to avoid the shambling corpses or fight them off one by one when necessary. Within twenty-four hours, the last of the zombies had expired, marking the end of the outbreak. An autopsy of one of the zombies revealed that it had died of starvation, having been unable to hunt or forage for itself. The CDC declared the zombie threat neutralized. The town began to rebuild, and the federal government launched studies to better understand how to contain future outbreaks, which they hoped would also prove as ineffectual as the first. Many were left wondering what might have happened if the zombies had shown even basic survival skills or pack instincts, but for now, the threat had passed.",

The tender, savory meat melted in my mouth, and the tangy mustard added the perfect kick. The first bite was a trip to heaven.

The attention to detail was evident in every aspect, from the quality of the ingredients to the meticulous way the sandwich was put together. The pickles were refreshing and crunchy, and they perfectly complemented the richness of the pastrami. I also ordered a cup of their homemade chicken soup, and the warm, comforting broth and tender pieces of chicken were the perfect accompaniment to the hearty sandwich.

I've used it for a variety of tasks, from organizing my daily routine to planning a vacation, and it's been a great help. Another feature I've found useful is the ability to collaborate with others. I've been working on a project with a few colleagues, and we've been using this app to keep track of our progress and share files. The customization options are also great, because I can tailor the app to my specific needs. I've also been impressed with the app's integration with other tools. I use a variety of productivity tools, and this one integrates nicely with all of them. It's been a great time saver, because we can all access the same information and work together seamlessly. One thing that sets this app apart from others is its ability to learn and adapt to my needs. The more I use it, the better it understands my habits and preferences, and it makes suggestions and recommendations accordingly. I can easily import information from other tools and use it to create a cohesive plan for my day. It's like having a personal assistant that's always there to help me. As far as downsides go, there aren't many.",

        "text": "Twenty-five years later, I had forgotten that wish. I was living my life, working nine to five, and barely having time for a social life. One evening, as I was walking home from work, I saw a strange object falling from the sky. As it drew nearer, I realized it was a star, and it was heading straight for me. I tried to move out of the way, but it was too late. The star landed in front of me, and I felt a strange sensation. I opened my eyes and saw a big, fluffy dog standing in front of me, wagging its tail. I couldn’t believe it. My childhood wish had finally come true! I realized that the star had granted my wish, though it had taken twenty-five years. I was so happy that I hugged the dog and cried tears of joy. The dog licked my face and snuggled up to me, making me feel loved and happy. I realized that sometimes, dreams do come true, though it may take a little longer than we expect. I named the dog Stella, after the star that had granted my wish. We became inseparable, going for walks, playing fetch, and snuggling up together every night. As the years went by, Stella and I grew old together. We had our ups and downs, but our love for each other never waned. I was grateful for the gift of Stella, and I knew that she would be my best friend forever. She was more than a pet. She was a reminder that anything is possible if we believe. I looked back on the day when the star granted my wish, and I knew that it had changed my life forever. I was happy.",

I took a deep breath and decided to explore my new surroundings. As I walked along the street, I noticed the looks of surprise and disdain on the faces of the people I passed. They had never seen anyone like me before—a punk-rock guitarist in their refined society. I was shocked, but I was determined to make the most of my time here. I began to strum my guitar and sing, my voice resonating off the brick buildings. People stopped and stared, some in admiration, others in disgust. But as I continued to play, something amazing happened. People began to gather around me, captivated by the raw energy of my music. They had never heard anything like it before, and they couldn’t help but be drawn in. They didn’t care that I was a stranger, or that I was dressed differently. They were only interested in the music and how it made them feel. Soon I had a small crowd of people, dancing and singing along. They couldn’t understand how I had managed to travel through time, but they didn’t care. As the days went by, my fame spread. People came from all over the city to hear me play, and I became known as the punk-rock guitarist from the future. I played for kings and queens, for peasants and prostitutes. I played in the streets and in palaces, and everywhere I went people responded with the same enthusiasm. All that mattered was the music. I became a beloved figure in Georgian London, a symbol of rebellion and freedom.",

He couldn’t shake the feeling that he should be doing something more important, but the bills had to be paid. Arriving at his desk, he found his colleagues glued to the TV, watching the latest news reports on the cataclysmic event predicted for that day. The usually busy streets were deserted, save for a few frantic souls hurrying by. Mark absentmindedly turned on his computer and began to check his emails. The world might be coming to an end, but the bureaucracy continued. The day dragged on, and Mark worked steadily, a mixture of apprehension and impending doom keeping him focused. The emails were full of last-minute requests and panicked clients. As the clock ticked closer to midnight, his heart pounded in his chest. With each passing minute, he expected the earth to open up or the sky to turn blood red. The office buzzed with a strange energy, a mixture of fear and resignation. Midnight came and went without any cataclysmic event. The new day dawned, and it seemed no different from the old one. But nothing happened. Mark felt a mixture of relief and disappointment. As he reflected on the experience, he realized how absurd it all was. The world hadn’t come to an end, but he had spent his last hours on earth in a boring office, answering emails. He vowed to live each day as if it were his last, to embrace the things that mattered most. Life was short, and he had just wasted precious time on trivial matters. The following Monday, he handed in his resignation.",

From the moment I approached the counter, it was obvious that the staff had no interest in providing even the most basic level of customer service. The employees seemed disinterested and aloof, barely acknowledging my presence or offering any help. When I finally managed to get their attention, their responses were curt and devoid of any genuine effort to assist me. I waited patiently for someone to help me, but time seemed to drag on as they attended to other tasks, ignoring the customers in front of them. To make matters worse, the staff’s lack of knowledge was astonishing. It was as if they had never bothered to familiarize themselves with the products they were selling or to educate themselves on the basic principles of beer appreciation. Simple questions about the different beer styles were met with blank stares or dismissive shrugs. The disorganization of the store only added to my growing dissatisfaction. The shelves were haphazardly arranged, making it difficult to find what I was looking for. The general cleanliness of the store was also disappointing, with dusty bottles and spills on the floor. The final straw came when I tried to ask about a particular beer that I had heard so much about. The employee I approached seemed annoyed by my question and offered no helpful information. I left the store feeling not only disappointed but also disrespected as a customer. It was clear that customer satisfaction was not a priority for this beer distributor. As a beer enthusiast, finding a place that values its customers and provides excellent service is of utmost importance to me.",

But everything seemed to be normal, except for the unfamiliar boy. He decided to investigate further and went to his parents' bedroom. When he opened the door, he was shocked to see his parents sitting on the bed, smiling at him, but their eyes seemed to be different. \" Mom, Dad, what's wrong?\" Max asked, trying to keep his voice calm.

I was after something far more valuable—things from Hell. I fished them out of the abyss and sold them in Heaven. But today my luck ran out. As I cast my line into the water, I felt something different. I pulled and pulled, but the thing on the end of my line was fighting me. Finally, I landed my catch—a small golden locket. I recognized it immediately. It was the locket I had given my wife before she died. Memories flooded back as I stared at the locket. Tears welled up in my eyes. I wondered how it had gotten here. Had my wife sent it to me? I could not believe it had ended up here, in the abyss of Hell. Had it fallen from Heaven, carried down by some unknown force? I would never know, but I was grateful to have it back. I put it in my pocket and felt a peace I had not felt for years. Maybe my wife was trying to tell me she was all right. Or maybe she was just trying to remind me that she was always with me, even in death. As I cast my line back into the water, I felt a sense of hope.

Above it was a sign with the words “Emergency Stop Button” in big black letters. I decided to ask my colleague John about it. “Hey, John, what's the emergency stop button for?” I asked, pointing to the button. “I have no idea. I've been working here for five years, and no one has ever pressed it. I don't think anyone knows what it's for.” I was intrigued. How could a button with such a sinister name be useless? I decided to investigate. I started by asking our supervisor, Mrs. Smith, about the button. She shook her head and said she didn't know either. I decided to look for clues in the office. Maybe there was a hidden panel or something that would give me a clue. But after searching every inch of the office, I came up empty-handed. I was beginning to think that the button was just a prank, a joke that some bored employee had installed years ago. I even looked it up on the Internet, but all I found were conspiracy theories about secret government experiments and alien invasions. But then one day I saw something that made me change my mind. A tiny flashing light next to the button. It was so small that I almost missed it, but it was definitely there. I decided to investigate further. I got a ladder and climbed up to the ceiling, where I found a small panel with a few wires leading to the button. I carefully followed the wires and found that they led to a small room in the basement.",

My friend had been studying reincarnation and the teachings of the organization for months. They believed that by taking their own life, they would be reborn into a better life.” I was sceptical, but the man showed me proof. My friend had been planning their suicide for months, thinking it would lead to a better life. The man told me that the organization had a way of communicating with the dead. I couldn’t believe it. “They believe that the soul can be transferred into a new body, but the old body must be properly released. Your friend must have had a plan to ensure their safe passage.” I was still sceptical, but the man’s words stayed with me. Perhaps there was more to life than we knew. Perhaps there was more to life than we could ever know. Days turned into weeks. The community still looked to me for answers, but I had none.

Amidst the festive harvest decorations, a local farmer's display of giant pumpkins revealed a gruesome surprise: a body stuffed inside one of the gourds. The fake spider webs and plastic skeletons that surrounded the pumpkin did little to conceal the horrifying truth. As word of the discovery spread, the townspeople were gripped with fear and speculation. Some believed it was a prank gone awry, while others thought it was the work of a serial killer.The police were quick to investigate, and their efforts were soon rewarded. Over the next few days, several more bodies were found in similar pumpkins scattered throughout the town. The reactions of those who stumbled upon the bodies ranged from disbelief to unadulterated horror. Some residents were too terrified to leave their homes, while others demanded justice for the victims. The town was in a state of panic, with no one knowing when or where the killer would strike again.As the investigation continued, the police uncovered clues that suggested the killer was not just a mindless psychopath, but someone with a twisted sense of humor. Each pumpkin was carved with a smiling face or a silly design, making the discovery of the bodies even more jarring. The townspeople were left to ponder the motives behind such a heinous act.The killer was eventually caught and revealed to be a former resident who had been wronged by the townspeople in some way. The motive was revenge, and the pumpkins were a warped way of making a statement. The town breathed a collective sigh of relief as the killer was taken away, but the memory of the pumpkin murders would haunt them for years to come.",

Their coconut curry laksa particularly stood out for its exceptional flavor and uniqueness. It arrived piping hot with thin rice noodles encircled by shrimp, chicken, and an assortment of vegetables in a rich and creamy coconut curry broth. I was impressed by the depth of flavor in every spoonful. In addition to the laksa, I tried their nasi lemak, a classic Malaysian rice dish packed full of ingredients. It included peanut sauce, cucumbers, anchovies, fried chicken, and a sunny-side up egg atop coconut rice - an hearty and satisfying meal.Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes and shared some background on Malaysian cuisine, which I always find interesting to learn about different cultures' flavors and ingredients. The restaurant fostered a warm and welcoming atmosphere through its Malaysian artwork and furnishings that helped set the scene. Prices were also very reasonable given the generous portion sizes. It's evident a great deal of care went into sourcing high quality ingredients and faithfully preparing the dishes. I plan to return to sample other menu items like the satay skewers and curry rendang. The menu also featured many vegetable and seafood options for diners of varied dietary preferences. It was refreshing to see a Malaysian restaurant emphasize their culture's multicultural influences from places such as Thailand, India, and China. This type of culinary diversity is what makes exploring ethnic cuisines so fascinating. Based on my first visit, Nyonya has swiftly become my new favorite Malaysian spot in town.",

The nurse had just finished preparing the syringe when she noticed something peculiar. \"That's odd,\" she mused, gazing at my arm. \"The needle seems to be bending. \"I looked down and was taken aback by the sight of the needle warping and twisting, as if it were made of rubber. \"I've never seen anything like it,\" the doctor said, entering the room. \"It's almost as if the needle has developed a consciousness and is resisting the idea of piercing your skin. \"We were all captivated by the bending needle, unsure of how to respond to this strange phenomenon.Suddenly, a brilliant light filled the room, and a figure materialized before us. It was an angel, its wings radiating a soft, ethereal glow. \"I have come to deliver a message,\" the angel declared, its voice like a symphony. \"The era of PVP has come to an end, and a new era of peace and understanding has begun. \"We listened in stunned silence as the angel explained that the bending needle was a physical manifestation of this new era, a sign of the shift in human consciousness.As the angel vanished, we couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. The world was truly evolving, and we were all part of this transformation.The doctor and nurse exchanged a glance, then turned their attention back to me.",

They were more than willing to offer recommendations and answer any inquiries we had. The waiting times were reasonable, and our food arrived promptly.In addition to the main course, we indulged in a few of their desserts, and they were truly heavenly.

I gathered some loose knitting yarn and a spare needle to get started. At first, the spider was frightened and did not want to come near me or the materials. It took some coaxing, but I was finally able to gently pick up the spider. I placed it on the needle and offered it one of the yarns to begin knitting with. However, the spider just sat there, not moving or understanding what I wanted it to do. I tried moving its legs to wrap the yarn around the needle but it just wiggled away. After many failed attempts, I realized spiders may not have the dexterity for knitting. Feeling bad that I was stressing the spider, I gave up for the day.The next day, I decided to try a different approach. I laid out the yarns in a way that made a path for the spider to walk on. To my surprise, it started slowly making its way along the yarn. Encouraged, I kept gently moving and repositioning the yarns, hoping it would start wrapping them inadvertently. But the spider remained focused on just walking, not knitting. Seeing it was not grasping the task, I rethought the whole plan. Perhaps knitting was too complex an activity for such a small creature. I began wondering if I could teach it any skills at all. Dejected, I was ready to abandon the project when I noticed the spider attempting to wrap a yarn around one of its legs as it walked. Eureka!

We decided to visit a local expert on body switching, hoping she could shed some light on the situation.We arrived at the expert's office, and she listened to our story intently. When we finished, she nodded thoughtfully. \"This is indeed a strange occurrence,\" she said. \"But don't worry, I think I know what might be happening. \"She explained that sometimes, when we switch bodies, we can get stuck in a loop. This means that we can switch back to a body we've been in before, even if it's not the body we're supposed to be in. \"But how do we get out of this loop?\"",

Bees diligently buzzed from one delicate petal to another, gathering nectar with purpose and determination. The radiant sun, a golden orb in the sky, cast its warm glow upon the scene, infusing the surroundings with a touch of magic.A nearby stream meandered gracefully, its crystal-clear waters gurgling over smooth pebbles, temptingly inviting me to dip my fingers into its coolness. Gliding gracefully along the current, a family of ducks flaunted their elegance, their feathers ruffling with each gentle movement. In the distance, the proud mountains stood tall, their peaks adorned with a delicate mist rising from the valleys below, creating an ethereal ambiance.As I continued on my path, a playful squirrel scampered across, leaving tiny paw imprints on the fallen leaves. The earthy aroma of damp soil mingled harmoniously with the sweet scent of wildflowers, captivating my senses and filling me with a sense of wonder.",

Many brave souls had attempted to liberate the sword, but none had succeeded.Enter Thomas, a young, humble blacksmith with a fierce determination in his eyes and a smile on his face. Undaunted by the villagers' doubts and jeers, he confidently strode into the village square, his gaze fixed on the sword.As he approached the stone and anvil, Thomas took a deep breath, grasped the hilt of the sword with both hands, and pulled with all his might. The sword, unyielding and unmoved, refused to budge.But Thomas was not one to be deterred. He felt a strange, inexplicable sensation coursing through his body, as if the sword itself was urging him to try again. With renewed resolve, he pulled the sword once more, and to the utter amazement of the onlookers, it began to move. Slowly but surely, the sword was freed from its centuries-old prison, its blade glinting triumphantly in the sunlight.The villagers, in awe and wonder, fell to their knees, acknowledging Thomas as their rightful king. The news of his feat spread like wildfire throughout the land, drawing people from far and wide to pay homage to their new ruler.In a grand ceremony, Thomas was crowned king, and he vowed to rule with wisdom, justice, and compassion. But not all were pleased with the turn of events. The deposed king, who had ruled with an iron fist, refused to accept Thomas's claim to the throne.Gathering his loyal followers, the former king marched on Winchester, determined to take back what he believed was rightfully his.",

Others simply have the personalisy to be miserable. Some people will find reasons to be miserable, even if they are in an advantageous position in live. Theer are people who enjoy feeling that they are the victim. Then you have people who are just plain miserqable and they have no apparent reason to be. tIt is interesting to observe these indiiduals, because they often appear to be quite happy at times, however, they always seem to revjert back to their default state of misery. I am sure that there are studies to show why people are miserable, but I would rather not delve into the sciencS of it, as it makes perfect sense to me why poeple wold not want to be happy. However, it is a shame to se so many miserable faces around, when it is so easy to make the change and smil. I think we should all look to smile more and nejoy life, rather than being miserable. Miserv is a choice, not something that just happens to you. Being happy can be easy, if you just Ngive it a go. There is no point in gKoing through life, looking mserable and being negative all the time, when there is such a simple fix to it. I do know that there are situatiEns where people have valid reasons for feeling negative, and that is understandable. Bu, there are lso times when you may have reasons to be happy, but you choose not to see them. That is sYad, because you have the power to change things.",

My ancestors weren't just any ordinary aliens, they were actually members of an advanced rae of beings. I felt Dlike I was living in a science fiction movie. yM mind raced with questions and doubts. How culd this be possible? How coud I have never known this about myself? As I continued to explore my results, I discGvered that my ancestors had come to Earth thousands of years ago, and had lived among humans for genertions. hTey had interbred with humans, and their DNA had been passde down through the generations, all the way to me. I couldn't believe that I was a producp of this ancient interbreeding. It was hard to wrap my head arounJd it. I decided to reach out to AncestryDNA to get more informatin, but they were tight-lipped about the whole thing. Thy told me that my esults were not a mistake, and that they had known about my extraterrestrial heritage all along. I was stuned. How could they have known this and not todl me?",

The menu offered a broader range of sushi options, from classic rolls to creative specialty rolls. We started off with an assortment of ɑppetizers, including miso soup, edamame, and gyoza. The miso soup was perfectly proficient and had a rich, savory flavor. The edamame was tender and lightly salted, making it an addictive refreshment. The gyoza had a crispy exterior and a deliciously juicy filling, creating a delightful comЬination of textures. Onto our main course, we ordered a variety of sushi rolls to share. The presentation was impeccable, with each roll beautifully organized on the platter. The sushi was made with fresh, high-quality inɡredients, and the flavors were exceptional. The fish was incredibly fresh and melted in our mouths, while the ⲅice was perfectly seasoned and had a fragile texture. One of the standout rolls we tried was the Ramen Kim Signature Roll. It was a combination of tuna, salmon, avocado, and cucumber, top with a tangy special sauce. The aromas were perfectly balanced, and every bite was a burst of deliciousness. We also enjoyed the Spicy Tunɑ Roll, which had just the right amount of heat and a satisfying kick. The serves at Sushi Kim was top-notch. The waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable, and always had a smile on their facing. Our water glasses were rеgularly refilled, and our plates were promptly cleared after each course.",

Sеtting up the drone was straightforward through the user-friendly DJI Fly app which wɑlked me through every step of calibration and setup. My first flights with the Skydio 2 was very impressive as it easily and stably followed me without any input from the controller. The obstacle avoidance workeԁ flawlessly and it was able to fly complex maneuvers completely autonomously. Video and still images came out razor sharp with the high-quality camera and carburetor. Flying modes like journey and dronie that automaticaⅼly track and film a subject were really convenient. Battery life was decent, giving me around 20 ｍinutes of run time peⲅ flight which was enough for quick tests and photoshoots.
